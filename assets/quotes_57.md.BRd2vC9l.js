Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: What could cats do if they were taller? Possible A: annoy, eat meat, open doors, need food, jog Why is \\"open doors\\" an answer aligned with human common sense?","completion":"Step 1: Analyze the question The question asks what cats could do if they were taller. This implies that their physical height has increased, and thus, may provide them with new abilities or enhance existing abilities due to their increased height. Step 2: Evaluate the provided possible answers We have been given 5 possible answers: annoy, eat meat, open doors, need food, jog. Step 3: Apply human common sense to eliminate unrelated answers - Annoy: Although taller cats might potentially annoy people in new ways, the task refers to the abilities that cats would gain, not behaviors they might exhibit. So, this option is not relevant to the question. - Eat meat: Cats already eat meat and being taller wouldn't necessarily affect this ability. So, this answer is not relevant. - Open doors: A taller cat would have a higher reach, which could potentially allow them to interact with door handles or knobs. Therefore, this answer is related to the role of height. - Need food: Cats already need food, and an increase in height doesn't seem to directly impact this need. So, this answer isn't relevant. - Jog: Cats can already jog, and while being taller might slightly alter their gait, it doesn't seem to be a new ability. This answer is not directly relevant to the task. Step 4: Select the most appropriate answer Based on human common sense and the process of elimination, \\"open doors\\" is the answer most aligned with the question. It takes into consideration the increased height of the cats and identifies a new ability that they could potentially have due to the change in their physical stature."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer this question: \\"A Russian political satirist, later exiled, who wrote the plays \\"\\"Dead Souls\\"\\" and \\"\\"The Government Inspector\\"\\" was..?\\"","completion":"The Russian political satirist you are referring to is Nikolai Vasilievich Gogol. Born on March 31, 1809, Gogol was an esteemed writer and playwright known for his sharp wit and criticism of Russian society. Later in his life, he faced exile due to the controversial nature of his works but remains a significant literary figure in the Russian literary canon. Although Gogol wrote \\"Dead Souls\\" and \\"The Government Inspector,\\" it is important to note that \\"Dead Souls\\" is not a play but rather a novel – albeit with a satirical bent. Published in 1842, \\"Dead Souls\\" is a social critique and dark comedy set in early 19th century Russia. The novel revolves around the protagonist, Pavel Ivanovich Chichikov, who seeks to exploit a bizarre loophole in imperial Russian law to amass wealth and prestige. Chichikov travels across the country, buying the \\"souls\\" of deceased serfs who are still listed on census roles, thereby reducing the taxes landowners have to pay. \\"Dead Souls\\" offers a scathing commentary on the moral decay of Russia's nobility and the bureaucratic inefficiencies that plagued the nation at the time. \\"The Government Inspector,\\" also known as \\"The Inspector General,\\" is a comedic play written by Gogol in 1836. Intended to satirize the rampant corruption within the Russian government, the play follows the story of a small provincial town thrown into chaos when the local officials learn of a government inspector's impending arrival. Mistaken identity, bribery, and deception are pervasive themes in the play, as officials scramble to ensure that their misconduct remains hidden. The play is not only a biting critique of the political class but also a testament to Gogol's exceptional ability to blend satire and humor. As a result of the unapologetic nature of Gogol's critiques, he faced opposition from conservative leaders and clerks who felt personally attacked by his critiques. Ultimately, Gogol's criticisms edged him into exile, but his influence on Russian literature remains pervasive. Despite a tumultuous career, Nikolai Gogol set the stage for some of Russia's greatest literary figures, including Fyodor Dostoyevsky and Leo Tolstoy. Today, his works continue to be celebrated for their wit, humor, and the crucial insights they offer into the realities of 19th-century Russian society."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Suspect charged with murder in LAX shooting The source of Ciancia’s apparent hostility toward the TSA remained unclear and puzzling. But a statement filed in court by the FBI gave the first detailed account of how the shootings unfolded. According to the FBI, Ciancia entered the airport’s Terminal 3 about 9:20 a.m. and approached the security checkpoint. Pulling a Smith & Wesson .223-caliber M&P-15 assault rifle from his bag, he fired multiple times at point-blank range at Hernandez, who was on duty and in uniform, leaving the screener wounded. Then, after starting up an escalator, Ciancia looked back at Hernandez, who appeared to move. Ciancia then went back to shoot him again. the statement said.Hernandez was fatally wounded. Ciancia then shot at “at least” two more TSA employees and one airline passenger, wounding all three, before two pursuing Los Angeles Airport Police officers wounded him, the FBI said. In a bag that Ciancia had at the airport, the FBI said, other law enforcement officers found a handwritten letter, signed by the suspect, saying that he had “made the conscious decision to try to kill” TSA employees. Ciancia’s possessions at the scene “included five magazine clips” of ammunition. Ciancia was taken to a hospital; an FBI spokesman said no information about his condition was being released Saturday night. The gunfire sent panic through the nation’s third-busiest airport and disrupted air traffic there along with the travel plans of thousands of would-be passengers throughout the nation. The airport was fully reopened on Saturday afternoon, authorities said. On Saturday, Hernandez’s wife spoke to reporters outside her Los Angeles area home, describing him as a “wonderful husband, father, brother, son and friend.” She said her husband, who was about to turn 40, had come to the United States at age 15 from El Salvador and “took pride in his duty for the American public.” Still unclear Saturday was what had led Ciancia to make the TSA his alleged target, but there were signs of psychological trouble. According to an account from police in the New Jersey town where he grew up, Ciancia had sent a text message to his brother indicating that he might harm himself. The message had aroused enough concern to prompt his father on Friday to get authorities to check on him in Los Angeles, where he was living. “I understand that they tried to reach him,” said a neighbor of Ciancia’s father in New Jersey, “but they missed him.” The incident also raised questions about airport security and the possible mixture of mental illness and weapons, as well as about Ciancia’s state of mind. Summary:","completion":"A suspect, Ciancia, has been charged with murder in a shooting at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) where he targeted Transportation Security Administration (TSA) employees, resulting in the death of screener Gerardo Hernandez and wounding several others. Ciancia's motive for targeting the TSA remains unclear.

He was wounded by law enforcement and taken into custody. A handwritten letter found on Ciancia expressed his desire to kill TSA employees.

Question: If I wanted the gallery to be an equal distance from everyone, where might I put it? Options: A. downtown area B. middle of town C. large city D. london E. lot of people Answer:","completion":"B. middle of town To ensure that the gallery is an equal distance from everyone, it would be advisable to place it in the middle of the town. This central location would typically provide easier access for the majority of people in the community, as it is likely that the town center or middle is a central point surrounded by residential, commercial, and recreational areas. Option A, the downtown area, might work if the downtown district is centrally located, but in many cases, downtown areas tend to be crowded, and not always easily accessible to all residents. Placing the gallery in a downtown location could create challenges related to parking, traffic congestion, and public transportation. Option C, a large city, is not specific enough, as the ideal placement of the gallery would depend on the geographical layout and structure of that particular city. Furthermore, a large city doesn't necessarily guarantee equal accessibility to everyone, as people living on the outskirts or in surrounding towns might face difficulties in accessing the gallery. Option D, London, is a specific city and might not represent an equal distance from everyone globally or even regionally. Choosing a single city as the location for the gallery would inherently exclude many people based on their geographical location. Option E, a lot of people, is an ambiguous choice and does not provide a clear idea of where to place the gallery to ensure equal distance from everyone. Therefore, the most logical choice to ensure that the gallery is an equal distance from everyone would be to place it in the middle of the town. This central placement should provide easier accessibility, help minimize potential barriers related to transportation, and promote a sense of inclusivity within the community."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Northern region where the animals are exposed to a lot of abiotic stress, and the southern region, where the animals experience almost no abiotic stress. and a hint : Biodiversity is determined by many things, and one of them is abiotic stress. If an environment is highly stressful, biodiversity tends to be low. If abiotic stress does not have a strong presence in an area, the biodiversity will be much higher.This idea leads into the understanding of how abiotic stress and endangered species are related. It has been observed through a variety of environments that as the level of abiotic stress increases, the number of species decreases. This means that species are more likely to become population threatened, endangered, and even extinct, when and where abiotic stress is especially harsh. Please answer this question : Which region had more species go extinct? Answer:","completion":"To answer the question, let's consider the information provided step by step: 1. Italy has two distinct regions: Northern and Southern. 2. Northern region experiences high abiotic stress, while the Southern region experiences low abiotic stress. 3. Biodiversity tends to be low in environments with high abiotic stress and high in environments with low abiotic stress. 4. Higher levels of abiotic stress lead to a higher likelihood of species becoming threatened, endangered, or extinct. Based on these observations, we can infer that the Northern region of Italy with high abiotic stress would have a higher likelihood of species going extinct compared to the Southern region with low abiotic stress. Therefore, more species likely went extinct in the Northern region."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

However, drawing the conclusion \\"A person is riding a motorcycle to jump off hills\\" from the given scenario would be making an assumption based on limited information. First, we need to consider the context. The original statement describes a single scenario or event, and we need more information to establish a pattern or intention on the part of the person riding the motorcycle. If multiple instances of a person riding a motorcycle to jump off hills were provided, we might be more inclined to make such a conclusion. Second, the statement does not explicitly mention the intention or purpose of the person riding the motorcycle. It is possible that the person is riding the motorcycle through a hill of dirt for various reasons: 1. Recreation or leisure: The person might be enjoying an off-road ride or participating in a motocross event. 2. Transportation: The person could be using the motorcycle as their primary means of transportation and the hill of dirt happens to be part of their route. 3. Occupational purposes: The person might be performing a professional activity requiring them to navigate through hills of dirt, such as a construction worker or geological surveyor. In the absence of additional information, we cannot definitively conclude that the person's primary intention is to jump off hills when they are riding a motorcycle. However, we can say that in this specific scenario, a person in a blue outfit is riding a motorcycle through a hill of dirt.

Movie title: Night Watch Context: Based on a play by Lucille Fletcher, Night Watch is a suspense thriller about a woman named Ellen Wheeler (Elizabeth Taylor), who one night, during a raging thunderstorm, frantically tells her husband John (Laurence Harvey) that from the living room window she has seen a murder being committed in the large old deserted house next door. John calls the police, but a search of the old house turns up nothing. The next morning, Ellen notices a freshly planted bed of flowers in the garden of the old house, that was not there before. She calls the investigating detective, Inspector Walker (Bill Dean), and suggests that the body of the murder victim she witnessed may be buried there. Inspector Walker then questions the caretaker of the old house, Mr. Appleby (Robert Lang), who confirms that he planted the flowers the night before during the storm, but refuses to let the police search the garden or dig up the flowers he just planted. Ellen is revealed to be recovering from a mental breakdown that occurred after her unfaithful first husband, Carl, was killed a few years earlier in an auto accident with his paramour. Ellen was traumatized by having to identify the bodies in the local morgue. Inspector Walker confides to John that Ellen may be mentally ill and suggests rest and a doctor. Ellen continues to maintain that she saw a murder in the deserted house, but there is no proof and John remains skeptical. Ellen's visiting friend Sarah Cooke (Billie Whitelaw) is equally skeptical and tries humoring Ellen by suggesting that she sees what she thinks she sees because of her recent breakdown. When both Ellen and Sarah see a man enter the old house the following night, they call the police, who find Mr. Appleby wandering around with a flashlight and arrest him for trespassing. A second search of the house and excavation of the garden reveal nothing, and Inspector Walker closes the case. John then brings over a psychiatrist friend of his, Tony (Tony Britton).

A good boxer needs a good defense.","completion":"Step 1: Identify the use of the word \\"defense\\" in the first sentence. In the sentence \\"Defense against hurricanes is an urgent problem\\", the word \\"defense\\" is used to describe the protection or measures against hurricanes. Here, it refers to a collective set of actions, preparations, or strategies to safeguard against the damages of hurricanes. Step 2: Identify the use of the word \\"defense\\" in the second sentence. In the sentence \\"A good boxer needs a good defense\\", the word \\"defense\\" is used to describe the ability or skill of a boxer to protect themselves from the opponent's blows. In this context, it refers to a personal attribute that a boxer needs to be successful in a fight. Step 3: Compare and contrast the use of \\"defense\\" in both sentences. Both sentences use the word \\"defense\\" to represent a concept of protection or safeguard. However, the contexts are different: 1. In the first sentence, \\"defense\\" is used in the context of a broad, societal issue - protection against hurricanes. It implies an organized and planned effort from various stakeholders for a shared goal. 2. In the second sentence, \\"defense\\" is applied in the context of a boxer in a sports competition. It's about an individual's ability to protect themselves while competing against an opponent. This use of the term \\"defense\\" is specific to the context of boxing or similar sports. Conclusion: Although the word \\"defense\\" conveys a similar concept of protection in both sentences, its application is different between the two contexts - one at the societal level against a natural disaster, and the other at the individual level in a sports competition.

Options： A. veldt B. ocean C. savannah D. africa E. jungle The answer is:","completion":"C. Savannah A lion is most likely to live in the savannah. The savannah is a grassland ecosystem characterized by its open spaces and small clusters of trees. It is an ideal habitat for lions because it provides room for them to roam and a diverse range of prey, such as antelopes and zebras. Additionally, the tall grasses found in the savannah offer lions sufficient cover to stalk and ambush their prey effectively, which is a crucial aspect of their hunting strategy. To further explore each option: A. Veldt - A veldt is a type of open grassland found in South Africa, and although it shares similarities with the savannah, referring to it as \\"veldt\\" is geographically specific to South Africa. Savannah is a broader term that encompasses various regions where lions are likely to be found. B. Ocean - Lions are terrestrial mammals and do not reside in oceanic environments. They are not adapted for aquatic life, as they lack the required physical traits, such as specialized limbs and respiratory systems, to survive in an ocean habitat. D. Africa - While Africa is correct in the sense that lions are predominantly found on this continent, it is not the most suitable answer because it is too general and does not specify the habitat in which lions live. The savannah, found in Africa, is a more precise and appropriate answer. E. Jungle - Jungles are dense, rainforest environments with a high amount of precipitation and biodiversity. Lions are not typically found in these habitats, as they prefer the open spaces and visibility provided by the savannah for their hunting and territorial needs. In conclusion, the most suitable option to answer the question, \\"Where is a lion likely to live?\\" is option C, Savannah, as this habitat provides the ideal conditions for lions to thrive in terms of prey availability, hunting strategies, and territory maintenance."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Read this and answer the question In December 1941, Japan launched, in quick succession, attacks on British Malaya, the United States naval base at Pearl Harbor, and Hong Kong. Churchill's reaction to the entry of the United States into the war was that Britain was now assured of victory and the future of the empire was safe, but the manner in which British forces were rapidly defeated in the Far East irreversibly harmed Britain's standing and prestige as an imperial power. Most damaging of all was the fall of Singapore, which had previously been hailed as an impregnable fortress and the eastern equivalent of Gibraltar. The realisation that Britain could not defend its entire empire pushed Australia and New Zealand, which now appeared threatened by Japanese forces, into closer ties with the United States.

Given the background: During May, June, and July, the Northern Hemisphere is exposed to more direct sunlight because the hemisphere faces the Sun. The same is true of the Southern Hemisphere in November, December, and January. It is Earth's axial tilt that causes the Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer months, which increases the solar flux. However, due to seasonal lag, June, July, and August are the warmest months in the Northern Hemisphere while December, January, and February are the warmest months in the Southern Hemisphere. and the situation: Two twin brothers live far away from each other.

Answer the following question: Which brother experiences less sunlight in August? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Bill, who lives in Tasmania in the Southern Hemisphere, experiences less sunlight in August. This is because August falls during the winter months in the Southern Hemisphere, when the region receives less direct sunlight due to the Earth's axial tilt. In contrast, Dan, who lives in North America in the Northern Hemisphere, experiences more sunlight in August because it is during the summer months when the Northern Hemisphere faces the Sun more directly. Consequently, Dan enjoys longer daylight hours, and the Sun is higher in the sky, resulting in increased solar flux and warmer temperatures."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Did India make a bad decision by buying 200 Kamov Ka-226 helicopters? Please tell me if those questions are the same. Select from: A). no. B). yes.","completion":"A). No. The two questions are not the same; they address different aspects of the military equipment purchasing decisions made by Pakistan and India. In order to provide a comprehensive answer, let's delve into each question separately. 1. Why is Pakistan buying the Russian Mil Mi-35 attack helicopter? Why not a more advanced Kamov Ka-52? There are several factors that can explain Pakistan's decision to buy the Russian Mil Mi-35 attack helicopter instead of a more advanced Kamov Ka-52. Some of these factors include: a. Budget constraints: The Mil Mi-35 is more cost-effective than the Kamov Ka-52. The Mi-35, being an upgraded version of the Mi-24, provides a relatively affordable solution to Pakistan's need for attack helicopters. The Kamov Ka-52, on the other hand, is equipped with more advanced technology and weaponry, which significantly raises its price. Countries like Pakistan often have to balance their needs with their financial capabilities and may opt for a more budget-friendly alternative. b. Compatibility with existing fleet: Pakistan has been operating the Mil Mi-24/35 family of helicopters for a long time, which makes it easier for the country to integrate the new Mi-35 into its current fleet. The military personnel are already familiar with the operational requirements and maintenance aspects of the Mi-24/35 helicopters, which would lower the overall costs of operating the Mi-35s. In contrast, the acquisition of the Kamov Ka-52 would require additional training and investments in infrastructure to accommodate the new helicopter. c. Geopolitical considerations: Pakistan's choice of military equipment is influenced by geopolitical factors, as well. Pakistan's relations with Russia have been improving over the past decade, with both countries cooperating on various arms deals, including the sale of the Mi-35 helicopters. The purchase of Russian military equipment is an indication of the strengthening relationship between the two countries. Additionally, buying the Mi-35 instead of the Ka-52 can also be seen as a way to avoid antagonizing other regional powers, such as China, which might find the more advanced Ka-52 as a potential threat. 2. Did India make a bad decision by buying 200 Kamov Ka-226 helicopters? It is difficult to label India's decision to buy 200 Kamov Ka-226 helicopters as either \\"good\\" or \\"bad.\\" The choice to purchase these helicopters was based on several factors, including their operational requirements, technological capabilities, and geopolitical considerations. Some of the reasons behind India's decision are: a. Versatility and operational capabilities: The Kamov Ka-226 is a versatile, multi-mission helicopter, suitable for a range of tasks such as logistics, transport, and reconnaissance. India's diverse terrain, including high-altitude regions, made the purchase of a versatile and adaptable helicopter particularly appealing. b. Technology transfer and indigenous production: One of the critical aspects of the Kamov Ka-226 deal was the inclusion of technology transfer and the production of the helicopters within India under the \\"Make in India\\" initiative. The ability to produce these helicopters indigenously provides India with a level of self-sufficiency in its defense industry and contributes to the growth of the domestic defense sector. c. Geopolitical considerations: The purchase of the Kamov Ka-226 can also be seen as a means to strengthen India's strategic relations with Russia. Russia has been a long-standing arms supplier to India, and the Ka-226 deal further emphasizes that relationship. In conclusion, the decisions made by Pakistan and India to purchase Mil Mi-35 and Kamov Ka-226 helicopters, respectively, were based on a range of factors, including budget constraints, operational requirements, and geopolitical considerations. These choices cannot be definitively classified as \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\" without considering the broader context in which they were made."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Does \\"On 17 April 1941, after King Peter II and other members of the government fled the country, the remaining representatives of the government and military met with the German officials in Belgrade.\\" correctly answer the question of What did Tito use to get the people to unit in a battle against the occupation in 1941?","completion":"No, the statement \\"On 17 April 1941, after King Peter II and other members of the government fled the country, the remaining representatives of the government and military met with the German officials in Belgrade.\\" does not correctly answer the question of what Tito used to get the people to unite in a battle against the occupation in 1941. While the statement does mention an important event in Yugoslav history during World War II, it does not adequately address Tito's role or the methods he used to rally the people against the occupation. To provide a more detailed and accurate answer to the question, it is important to focus on Tito's specific actions, leadership, and ideology. Josip Broz Tito, a communist revolutionary, became the leader of the Yugoslav Partisans during World War II. The Partisans were a resistance movement against the Axis occupation and their local collaborators in Yugoslavia. Tito was able to motivate and unite his followers in the battle against occupation through various means. 1. Ideology: Tito and his fellow communists emphasized the importance of a unified struggle against fascist and nationalist oppressors. By promoting the shared goal of communism and a society void of class distinctions, Tito was able to rally various factions of the Yugoslav population together, transcending the divisions between the different ethnic and religious groups. 2. Resistance to Occupation: Tito capitalized on the resentment Yugoslav people felt towards the occupying forces, particularly the brutality of the German, Italian, and Hungarian armies, as well as the collaborationist regimes like the Ustaše-led Independent State of Croatia and the Serbian puppet government run by Milan Nedić. By providing a military and political alternative to these entities, Tito attracted support from a broad spectrum of the population. 3. Organization and Military Strategy: Tito's leadership proved to be effective, as he was able to organize and coordinate diverse resistance groups into a united, disciplined, and effective fighting force. The Yugoslav Partisans employed guerilla warfare tactics, which helped them to launch successful attacks against the numerically superior, well-equipped enemy forces. These victories increased public support for the Partisans and augmented their ranks as more people joined them. 4. Aligning with the Allies: Tito's Partisans established contact with the Western Allies, particularly the British, and gained support through the supply of weapons, equipment, and intelligence. This international support further legitimized the Partisans and boosted morale, as it signaled that the world considered them a legitimate force fighting against Axis occupiers. 5. Creation of a Parallel Government: The Partisans established the Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Yugoslavia (AVNOJ) in 1942, which functioned as a political representation for the resistance movement. This council provided a political framework for the post-war communist government and allowed Tito to showcase a vision for the future of a liberated and united Yugoslavia. Through a combination of ideology, resistance to occupation, effective organization, military strategy, external support, and establishment of a parallel government, Tito was able to unite the Yugoslav population in a common struggle against the Axis occupation in 1941. These factors provided a strong foundation for both the Partisan forces and Tito's eventual ascent as the leader of socialist Yugoslavia after World War II."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","completion":"To answer this question, we need to analyze the relationship between the number of fetuses growing and the number of babies born. Step 1: More fetuses growing If there are more fetuses growing, it implies that more embryos (C) have developed and are within the stage where they grow and develop into fetuses inside the woman's womb. Step 2: Analyzing the relationship An increase in fetuses growing suggests that there would be more babies born in the future, given no complications during pregnancies. As a result, more fetuses growing would lead to more babies born, rather than less. Step 3: Perturbation influencing the second effect If the perturbation is increasing the number of fetuses growing, it would have a 'more' effect on the number of babies born, as previously mentioned.

After carefully examining Patricia's inflamed skin, listening to her recount each symptom, and charting the seasonal onset of the condition, Dr. Elena Ortega, a seasoned dermatologist with over fifteen years of experience, decided that a prescription medicine seemed to be the most appropriate course of treatment. As she reached aside to her modern computer and began typing, Dr. Ortega explained the choice she had made. \\"You're experiencing a fairly severe flare-up of eczema,\\" she said to Patricia, her fingers flowing over the keyboard. \\"This is not unusual when winter comes. Lower temperatures, less moisture in the air, the shift from heated indoor spaces to the cold outside – it all can make the symptoms worse. A prescription cream can help manage the outbreak by reducing inflammation, easing the itchiness, and hydrating the skin.\\" She finalized the prescription and handed Patricia a printout, explaining each detail: a topical steroid cream for immediate relief of symptoms, an emollient to provide long-lasting moisturization, as well as an oral antihistamine to control the itch. \\"The steroid cream should reduce the inflammation and alleviate the redness and itching, applying it twice daily should start showing results in no more than a week.\\" Dr. Ortega explained, pointing to the first item on the printout. \\"The emollient, on the other hand, should be applied generously and often. It will lock moisture into your skin and prevent it from drying and chafing.\\" As for the final item, the antihistamine, Dr. Ortega told Patricia to take it at night. \\"It will help curb the itching especially during the night and also aid your sleep which can be disturbed due to intense itching. The only side effect is that it might make you a bit drowsy, so better to consume it before bedtime.\\" As if sensing Patricia's concern, Dr. Ortega quickly reassured her that these medications were generally safe for use but like any medicines, they should be used responsibly. She advised Patricia to apply the creams as directed, not more or less, and to contact her if any side effects were noticed. Before she let Patricia go, Dr. Ortega also gave her some additional advice to manage her eczema-prone skin during winter. She suggested using humidifiers at home, taking short lukewarm showers, wearing cotton and other soft fabrics as opposed to wool, and avoiding strong soaps and detergents that might irritate her skin. Doctor Elena watched as Patricia clutched the prescription in her hands, a sign of hope gleaming on her face. \\"Remember,\\" Doctor Elena said gently, \\"managing eczema during winter is about more than medications. It’s about changing your habits and creating a skin-care regimen that works for you. If done correctly and consistently, these efforts should bring noticeable improvement.\\" Patricia left Dr. Ortega’s office clutching her prescription with newfound hope, comforted by the fact that her eczema was manageable. The winter did not have to be a torment of itching and discomfort. For the first time in a long time, she was looking forward to the winter, ready now to face it with the right medication and skincare regimen. Thanks to Dr. Ortega’s professional guidance and empathetic care, Patricia felt equipped to handle her condition better in the challenging wintertime ahead."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

She desperately sought political asylum.

Produced by NYD2, a communications firm based in Somerset, the documentary features case histories of clients whose needs ranged from housing to fighting off deportation. Joseph, a 54-year-old naturalized citizen, turned to Legal Services when the landlord of his federally subsidized apartment complex in Elizabeth turned a deaf ear to his request for a ground-floor apartment. Having lost the use of his left arm in warding off the machete attack during a robbery attempt, Joseph said he found it increasingly difficult to negotiate the five flights of stairs lugging groceries or laundry on the frequent occasions when the building's elevator was out of order. \\"With this, it became impossible for me to stay upstairs,\\" he said, pointing to the scars on his forearm. \\"If I cannot carry my groceries or my laundry, how can I live?\\" \\"It was a compelling case,\\" said Legal Services attorney Stephen St. Hilaire. \\"The key for us -- and we have to make tough decisions all the time on whether to take a case -- was visualizing what he had to do to get to the fifth floor, struggling with a bag of groceries,\\" he said.

Trivia question: \\"Which fictional work features the 'Seven Commandments', which are summarised by the statement \\"\\"four legs good, two legs bad\\"\\"?\\" And the answer is?","completion":"The answer to the trivia question is \\"Animal Farm\\" by George Orwell. Animal Farm is a dystopian novella published in England on August 17, 1945. The story is an allegorical representation of the Russian Revolution of 1917, the rise of communism, and the Soviet Union regime led by Joseph Stalin. The novel revolves around a group of animals who take over a farm, aiming to establish a society free from human oppression and establish their own set of rules based on the principles of equality and freedom. The \\"Seven Commandments\\" represent the foundational principles of their newfound society, known as \\"Animalism.\\" These commandments are established by the pigs, who hold a dominant and intellectually superior position on the farm. The commandments serve as essential guidelines that all animals are expected to follow. They are: 1. Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy. 2. Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend. 3. No animal shall wear clothes. 4. No animal shall sleep in a bed. 5. No animal shall drink alcohol. 6. No animal shall kill any other animal. 7. All animals are equal. The statement \\"four legs good, two legs bad\\" is a simplification of the first two commandments, which are devised as propaganda by the pigs to make their message easily understandable by less-intelligent animals. This slogan serves as a frequent chant among the animals to remind them of their unity against their common enemy - humans. As the story progresses, the pigs manipulate, distort, and amend these commandments in response to the growing corruption and totalitarianism within the Animal Farm, resulting in the eventual downfall of their utopian society. The novel ultimately exposes the harsh truth that, despite the initial promise of equality and justice, the ruling class manipulates its power to exploit and oppress the very beings it vowed to protect and serve."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

By. Naomi Greenaway. Married with a child, Pyretta Blaze and Andy Filth (not their real names) from South Wales, say they're just like any other couple, apart from one slight difference -- they like to drink each other's blood. Andy and Pyretta, who appeared on This Morning to encourage more open-mindedness for their lifestyle, are part of the UK's 15,000 strong vampire community. Self-confessed vampire Andy, likened the act of slurping his partners blood to sex and said, 'When you're drinking each others blood you're connected to each others souls.' He said the taste didn't make him feel sick but admitted, 'It's not like strawberries -- it's got a metallic taste.' Scroll down for video. Your friendly vampires next-door: Pyretta Blaze (left) and Andy Filth (right) appeared on ITV's This Morning. Nowadays the couple satisfy their blood cravings in the privacy of their own bedroom, but in their single days they would go out on the prowl, like any other youngsters. 'I used to go to gatherings where the exchange of blood would happen,' explained Pyretta, who was keen to point out that it was safe and nothing for the public to be scared about. She assured viewers that they don't lurk around in the dark and only drink blood in the confines of the vampire community. 'Everyone is completely vetted to check they have no mental health history and have a clean blood record,' she said. 'Everyone has a full examination - mentally and physically.' 'You pick one partner you're totally happy with and it's very safe, clean and sterile.' When Philip then inquired if it was form of sex, she replied, 'Yes, of course! 'We are very health conscious - as you would be when having sex. We are very responsible,' she added. Pyretta (left) used to go to vampire gatherings to get her blood fix before she met Andy (right) But one thing that really gets Pyretta's blood boiling is Hollywood's portrayal of vampires. 'It really makes me mad!' she said. 'People are so misled and easily influenced by things in Hollywood. Interview with two vampires: The couple say they want to change misconceptions about the bloody-thirsty lifestyle. 'I can look into the mirror and do my hair!' she said referring to the myth that if vampires look at their own reflection the mirror cracks. So what actually goes on behind vampires' bedroom doors? 'You can have a ceremonial pin to draw blood,' Andy explained. 'You don't need a lot, just a small dab.' 'I do it from my neck just behind me ear,' he said revealing a tattoo of a vampire bite on the side of his neck. 'And we do try to use same spot every time.' 'It's not cut deep enough to scar. It's not self harm,' Pyretta was quick to add. Pyretta blames Hollywood for the misunderstanding surrounding vampires' scary image (as depicted above) 'The amount of blood you drawer depends on what you eat and drink because that affects blood flow,' he explained. 'But we use whatever comes out -- I wouldn't keep cutting,' he said. Of course, their hobby comes with a health warning and they admitted it's 'enormously dangerous'.'It can't just be done because you feel like it. You have to know what you're doing,' said Andy. 'It's our spiritual connection to each other. We have a child, which makes us as close as we can be. But the next step is to be joined by our souls. But Andy swears his love for Pyretta trumps his vampire lifestyle. 'If one of us wanted to stop, it wouldn't be over,' he said. 'I see it as bonus. It's something we're both into and a big part of our life. But if it was to go away we wouldn't need to find someone else. Also on the programme was psychologist, Dr Emyr Williams, who has been studying the vampires for ten years. 'It's a religion,' he explained. 'It's taken me 6 years to get the trust of the community so I can begin my research. It was very difficult because they are often mocked as society doesn't understand them. 'I've found out that these are normal people. They may need to consume blood and psychic energy - but they may not actually like that about themselves.' You can watch the full interview here.

Watson's decision to finalize his team selections before the completion of the FedEx Cup Playoffs now seems like a misstep, as Horschel and Kirk have proven in recent weeks that they are more than up to the task of representing their country in golf's biggest team event.

One night after winning a game, Monty and his best friend, the Bulls' catcher, Spike Nolan (John Candy), are hitting on two women at a local bar. When they try to leave with them, they're confronted by two large men who claim they are the women's husbands. Monty and Spike are punched out by the men and a large bar brawl starts. They are later arrested and thrown in jail. Their coach, Charley, tells them that management has decided to kick them off the team. In court, Monty tries to explain the fight to the judge, who is wholly unsympathetic. The photographer that had been following Monty suddenly rises and tells the judge that he represents an unidentified party that will post bail for both Monty and Spike if they plead guilty.J.B. Donaldo (Joe Grifasi) (the same photographer from the courtroom) takes them to New York City with him. At the Manhattan law office of Granville & Baxter, Brewster is told that his recently deceased great-uncle Rupert Horn (Hume Cronyn), whom he has never met, has left him his entire fortune because Monty is his only living blood relative (by way of Monty's grandmother, Rupert's half-sister), but with several conditions.Rupert's last will is on film and features the wheezy and ill-tempered Rupert himself. He relates a story from his youth where his father made him smoke a whole box of cigars to punish him for smoking just one. Rupert tells Monty that he wants Monty to hate spending money. Monty will be given 30 million to spend in 30 days. If he's successful, he'll be awarded the full inheritance of 300 million. Brewster is challenged to either take 1 million upfront (as part of a 'Wimp' clause) or spend 30 million within 30 days to inherit 300 million. If he chooses the former, the law firm becomes executor of the estate and divides the money among charities (after taking a sizable fee). In the latter case, after 30 days, he must spend the entire 30 million... My question: who has no concept of money?","completion":"In the movie \\"Brewster's Millions,\\" it is Montgomery \\"Monty\\" Brewster, played by Richard Pryor, who initially has no concept of money. His lack of understanding of money's value is highlighted as he is forced to spend 30 million within 30 days in order to inherit 300 million. This challenge is set by his recently deceased great-uncle Rupert Horn, who wants Monty to experience the difficulties and responsibilities of handling a substantial fortune. Throughout the story, Monty struggles to spend the required money within the allotted time frame, often not realizing the unintended consequences of his actions. His spending spree features him making poor investments, financing a failing political campaign, and organizing lavish parties/events, all in an effort to waste money quickly without gaining any significant assets. Along the way, Monty develops a better understanding of the value and responsibilities that come with handling significant amounts of wealth.

The museum decided to not purchase the armor, but purchased the sword instead, because the","completion":"sword was found to be a rare and exceptionally well-preserved piece, dating back to the 15th century. This particular period was a turning point in the history of warfare, as it marked the transition from civilian combat and hand-to-hand fighting to organized military campaigns. As a result, weapons from this time are highly valuable, not only for their historical significance but also for the incredible craftsmanship displayed in their construction. Furthermore, the unique characteristics of the sword make it a perfect addition to the museum's collection, which is dedicated to showcasing the evolution of weapons and army tactics over the centuries. The sword, which is believed to have belonged to a high-ranking nobleman, has a double-edged straight steel blade, meticulously crafted with the period's renowned metallurgical techniques. The detailed patterns visible on its surface are suggestive of high-quality Toledo steel, famous for its strength and resilience. The sword's hilt is composed of a gilded bronze cross-guard with intricate engravings that depict scenes from medieval battles. The handle, wrapped in luxurious blue velvet, is adorned with precious gems and pearls, indicating the sword's esteemed pedigree. Moreover, the museum had several crucial factors to consider when assessing the potential purchase of the armor and the sword. The armor, while impressive in its design and craftsmanship, is rather common in museums and private collections worldwide. Although the armor is a beautiful representation of the advances made in defensive technology, it does not offer the same level of historical significance or rarity as the sword does. The armor also appeared to have undergone extensive restoration, which decreases its overall value. On the other hand, the sword's remarkable state of preservation allows the museum not only to better understand its original form, but also to study the weapon-making techniques employed during this critical era in the history of warfare. Furthermore, the sword's provenance is considered to be more prestigious, as it was likely wielded by a highly influential figure in the course of various important military campaigns, which adds a certain mystique and educational value to the piece. Considering all these factors, the museum concluded that purchasing the sword would be a wise investment as it aligns more closely with their curatorial objectives. Subsequently, the sword became the centerpiece of a new exhibit on the history of medieval warfare, attracting visitors from around the world to marvel at its beauty and contemplate the multifaceted aspects of historical weaponry. Its inclusion in the museum's collection has enriched visitors' understanding of the profound impact that weapon development, combined with changing military tactics, had on the course of human history. In this context, acquiring the rare and captivating sword, as opposed to the armor, was unequivocally the right decision for the museum."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: The southern state of Alabama is the center of the U.S. political universe this week as voters on Tuesday choose a senator to replace Jeff Sessions, who left the Senate to become attorney general. The race pits controversial Republican Roy Moore, who is battling sexual harassment allegations, against Democrat Doug Jones, a former prosecutor. The outcome of the race could have national implications for both political parties and for President Donald Trump. Moore has denied several allegations of sexual misconduct when he was in his 30s involving women who were teenagers at the time, including one who was 14. \\"I do not know them. I had no encounter with them. I never molested anyone,\\" Moore said in a televised interview Sunday with the Voice of Alabama Politics. Jones says the accusations make Moore unfit to serve in the Senate. \\"It is crystal clear that these women are telling the truth and Roy Moore is not!\\" Jones said. Trump recorded a get-out-the-vote phone message for Moore and spoke on his behalf at a rally in neighboring Florida on Friday. \\"And we want jobs, jobs, jobs. So get out and vote for Roy Moore. Do it. Do it,\\" he said. Trump held off on endorsing Moore for several weeks in the wake of the sexual misconduct allegations, but now says electing Moore is a priority for him. \\"We certainly don't want to have a liberal Democrat who is controlled by Nancy Pelosi and controlled by Chuck Schumer. We don't want to have that for Alabama,\\" Trump said. In the final days of the campaign, Moore is highlighting his support for the president's agenda. \\"We are going to see if the people of Alabama will support the president and support his agenda in Washington by electing somebody that is not part of the establishment there,\\" Moore said. Democrat Jones told supporters that Moore's character is the issue. \\"We know who we are, Alabama, we know who we are. This is an election to tell the world who we are and what we stand for.\\" Question: Who is rallied for on his behalf in neighboring Florida? Options: A. President Trump. B. Roy Moore.

Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","completion":"To accomplish the goal of conducting an awesome color experiment using a mixture to break down a colored marker, the most effective and engaging method would be the \\"Chromatography\\" technique. This process allows us to separate and analyze the different pigments within ink, revealing the various colors that make up the seemingly single color of a marker. Here is a detailed step-by-step guide to conduct a chromatography experiment using a colored marker: Materials required: 1. A non-permanent colored marker (choose a color that is likely a mixture of several pigments, such as green, brown, or black) 2. A tall, narrow glass or cup 3. Filter paper (coffee filter, paper towel, or chromatography paper) 4. A pencil 5. A ruler 6. Scissors 7. A paper clip or tape 8. Solvent (water or rubbing alcohol, depending on the marker's ink) Procedure: 1. Prepare the glass or cup: - For the experiment, you will need a glass or cup that is tall and narrow enough to accommodate a strip of filter paper without the paper touching the sides of the container. 2. Prepare the filter paper: - Cut a strip of filter paper, approximately 2 cm wide and slightly longer than the height of the glass or cup. You can use a coffee filter, paper towel, or chromatography paper. 3. Mark the starting line: - Use a pencil and ruler to draw a straight horizontal line on the filter paper strip, about 2 cm from the bottom. It's crucial to use a pencil instead of a pen, as ink may interfere with the experiment. 4. Apply the colored marker: - Take the colored marker and draw a thick, solid line directly on the pencil line. You may need to repeat this a few times to ensure that there is enough ink on the paper. 5. Prepare the solvent: - Carefully pour the solvent (either water or rubbing alcohol) into the glass or cup. The level of the solvent should be just below the pencil line you drew on the filter paper. If you're unsure about the type of ink in the marker, perform two separate experiments using both water and rubbing alcohol to see which yields the best result. 6. Place the filter paper in the glass: - Carefully attach the top end of the filter paper strip to a paper clip or use tape to secure it. Then, hang the strip inside the glass or cup, making sure the ink side is facing down, and that the bottom of the paper is touching the solvent, but the ink line is not submerged in the solvent. 7. Observe the chromatography process: - As the solvent travels up the filter paper, it will begin to break down and separate the pigments in the colored marker ink. This process may take anywhere from a few minutes to an hour, depending on the ink and filter paper. Observe as the pigments separate and create a beautiful display of colors. 8. Analyze the results: - Once the solvent has traveled most of the way up the filter paper and the pigment separation is clear, remove the strip from the glass and allow it to dry. Examine the various pigments that make up the color of the marker, and compare the results to other colors or markers, if desired. Performing this chromatography experiment is a fun, hands-on way to explore chemistry concepts and demonstrate how a single color can be made up of multiple pigments. This method is a perfect blend of art and science that allows you to engage with and appreciate the beauty of color combinations found in everyday objects like colored markers."},{"prompt":"Q:Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: A creek can be located in a tree are called what?

On November 2, 2004, Dutch filmmaker Theo van Gogh was bicycling to work in Amsterdam when he was shot eight times at close range. He died instantly, but in a fit of rage, his assailant, Dutch-Moroccan Mohammed Bouyeri, also attempted to cut off his head with a machete. Bouyeri killed van Gogh because of a short film he had recently produced with Somali-born Dutch politician Ayaan Hirsi Ali that criticized Islam's treatment of women. The film showed verses of the Quran projected onto the bodies of several naked young women. It was a film designed to provoke. And it did. Ali subsequently went into a self-imposed exile in the United States. News: Six things to know about the attack. Now, seven years later, a short, amateurish film entitled \\"Innocence of Muslims,\\" purportedly created by Sam Bacile in the U.S., portrays the Prophet Mohammed as a philandering child molester. (\\"Sam Bacile\\" appears to be a pseudonym.) Terry Jones, a Christian pastor based in Florida who has a long history of making incendiary statements about Islam, is promoting \\"Innocence of Muslims.\\" Jones also recently called for an \\"International Judge Mohammed Day\\" to be held on the 11th anniversary of 9/11, this past Tuesday. News about the film has sparked outrage in the Muslim world. Mobs have attacked American embassies and consulates in Egypt, Libya and Yemen. The U.S. ambassador to Libya, J. Christopher Stevens, and three of his staff members were killed in what appears to have been a well-organized attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi on Tuesday. The attackers may have used the opportunity presented by the film protests to mount the assault. These attacks came after the accidental burning of Qurans by U.S. soldiers at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan in February sparked massive protests across the country, resulting in the deaths of at least 30 Afghans and six U.S. soldiers, all of whom were shot by men in Afghan security force uniforms. Opinion: Survivor of 1979 consulate attack -- Libya an eerie echo. And these are just the latest in a series of violent reactions to the perceived disrespect of the prophet and the Quran by Westerners -- sometimes intentional and sometimes unintentional -- that, in an increasingly globalized world of almost instantaneous communication, has intensified significantly during the past several years. And Muslim extremists as well as Christian fundamentalists in the West have increasingly intentionally amplified this trend. Politicians and the media in the Muslim world have also played an important, though perhaps unintended, role in stirring up violence in the wake of a number of these perceived attacks on Islam. A YouTube video of \\"Innocence of Muslims\\" that provoked the Libyan mob to attack the U.S. consulate in Benghazi was initially published in July, but it was not until versions of it dubbed in Arabic appeared online and were broadcast by religious Egyptian news channel al-Nas that protests sprouted in Egypt. A May 2005 Newsweek article claiming that American soldiers at Guantanamo had flushed a copy of the Quran down the toilet went unnoticed for nearly a week before Pakistani politician Imran Khan pointed the article out in a news conference. More than a dozen people were subsequently killed during protests in Afghanistan. (Newsweek later retracted the story.) Similarly, when Jones burned a copy of the Quran at his church on March 20, 2011, two weeks went by without any incident. But then President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan made a speech calling for his arrest. Within 24 hours, protesters stormed the United Nations compound in Mazar-e Sharif in northern Afghanistan, killing seven foreign employees, and demonstrations across the country killed more than a dozen other people. In 2005, the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten published 12 cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed, setting off a wave of protests and attacks over the next several years in which as many as 200 people have been killed. In 2008, for instance, al Qaeda claimed responsibility for the bombing of the Danish Embassy in Islamabad, which killed a half-dozen bystanders, saying the powerful suicide car bomb was in retaliation for the offensive cartoons. Two years later, Kurt Westergaard, one of the cartoonists, barely escaped from a Somali man linked to Al-Shabaab, al Qaeda's Somali affiliate, who broke into the cartoonist's home in Denmark with a knife and ax. But the violence sparked by the Jyllands-Posten cartoons, one of which depicted the Prophet Mohammed with a turban-wrapped bomb on his head, began a full four months after the images were published by the newspaper and were the result of a carefully orchestrated campaign by two Danish Muslim clerics who toured the Middle East, presenting a dossier about the cartoons to important religious and political figures. Opinion: Libya killings show U.S. at risk in Arab world. Included in the dossier were cartoons that had never appeared in the Jyllands-Posten newspaper, showing offensive images of the Prophet Mohammed. As a result, entering the Jyllands-Posten newspaper in Copenhagen today is akin to visiting a prison, with a heavily barred set of metal gates securing entrance to the building. And just as author Salman Rushdie remains under threat decades after the 1989 fatwa against him for his novel \\"The Satanic Verses,\\" so too the threat against Jyllands-Posten is likely to endure for many years. On Wednesday, Karzai released a public statement strongly condemning the recent \\"criminal act.\\" This was not a reference to the assault on the U.S. consulate in Libya a day earlier that resulted in the four deaths there but to the release of \\"Innocence of Muslims,\\" the video that denigrates the Prophet Mohammed. News: Unanswered questions after the attack. Karzai did express his condolences about the deaths at the Libyan consulate when he spoke privately to President Obama. However, his public statement will surely draw attention to an issue that is likely to cause additional violent protests in Afghanistan, which NATO forces are steeling themselves for.

Please answer the following question: The canopy, the upper level of the trees in the rain forest, holds too much of climbing mammals of moderately large size, which may include monkeys, cats, civets, and porcupines. Smaller species, including such as nice and small squirrels, are not as common overall in high tropical canopies as they are in most habitats globally. Small mammals, being warm blooded, suffer hardship in the exposed and uncertain environment of the uppermost trees. Because a small body has more surface area per unit of weight than a large one of similar shape, it gains or loses heat more rapidly. Thus, in the trees, where protection from heat and cold may be scarce and conditions may be changeable, a small mammal may have trouble maintaining its body temperature. Small size makes it easy to scramble among twigs and branches in the canopy for insects, flowers, or fruit, but small mammals are defeated, in the competition for food, by large ones that have their own strategies for browsing among tbod-rich twigs. The weight of an ape hanging below a branch draws the leaves down so that fruit-bearing leaves drop toward the ape's face. Walking or leaping species of a similar or even larger size access the outer twigs either by breaking and gaining the whole branch or by catching hold of hard branches with the feet or tail and picking food with their hands. Small climbing animals may reach twigs readily, but it is harder for them than for large climbing animals to cross the wide gaps from one tree top to the next that typify the high canopy. A gibbon can hurl itself farther than a mouse can: it can achieve a running start, and it can more effectively use a branch as a springboard . The forward movement of a small animal is seriously reduced by the air friction against the ly large surface area of its body. Which of the following questions does the passage answer? A) How is the rain forest different from other habitats? B) How does an animal's body size influence an animal's need for food? C) Why does rain forest provide an unusual variety of food for animals?

Body Temperature Regulation: Small mammals have a larger surface area per unit of weight than larger animals, which causes them to gain or lose heat more rapidly. In the exposed and uncertain environment of the upper canopy where protection from heat and cold may be scarce and conditions are changeable, a small mammal may struggle to maintain its body temperature. On the other hand, larger animals can better regulate their body temperatures in such conditions. 2. Food Competition: Though small mammals can easily scramble among the branches in the canopy for insects, flowers, or fruits, they are often defeated by larger animals in the competition for food. Larger animals have their own strategies for browsing among food-rich twigs. For example, an ape can hang below a branch and pull down fruit-bearing leaves towards its face, while walking or leaping species can access outer twigs by breaking branches or holding onto harder branches and picking food with their hands. 3. Mobility and Gap Crossing: In the high canopy, wide gaps from one treetop to another are common. Although small climbing animals may reach twigs easily, it is more challenging for them to cross these gaps compared to larger animals. Larger animals like gibbons are more capable of achieving a running start or using a branch as a springboard to clear the gap. The forward movement of a small animal is significantly reduced by air friction against its relatively large surface area, making it less capable of crossing gaps compared to larger animals. In summary, the passage answers the question about why large animals tend to dominate the upper canopy of the rain forest by explaining how larger animals have advantages in terms of body temperature regulation, food competition, and mobility compared to smaller animals in this specific environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The term Paraskavedekatriaphobia informally refers to an irrational fear of what time-related concern? What is the answer?","completion":"In order to provide the correct answer, I will first break down the term \\"Paraskavedekatriaphobia\\" into its parts and determine the meaning of each part. Step 1: Break down the term - \\"Para\\" is a prefix meaning alongside or beyond. - \\"skave\\" is derived from \\"skai\\", which commonly refers to \\"Fri\\" (as part of the name Friday). - \\"dekatria\\" is derived from the Greek words \\"deka\\" (meaning ten) and \\"tria\\" (meaning three), which together mean thirteen. - \\"phobia\\" refers to an irrational fear or aversion to something. Step 2: Combine the meanings Paraskavedekatriaphobia can be interpreted as an irrational fear related to alongside or beyond Friday and the number thirteen. Step 3: Determine the time-related concern When considering a time-related concern that involves Friday and the number thirteen, we can infer that the irrational fear is connected to Friday the 13th.

Birth and Origin: Lucas Boada was born in 1893 in Matanzas, a city in Cuba. This detail provides us with information about both his birth year and his nationality, which is Cuban. 2. Occupation: Lucas Boada was a baseball player who primarily served as a pitcher. His role as a pitcher is essential in the game as it involves throwing the ball from the pitcher’s mound toward the catcher to initiate each play, attempting to retire a batter. 3. Career Span: Boada's playing career in the Negro Leagues spans at least six years, from 1919 to 1924. This period allows us to understand the time frame in which Boada was active in professional baseball. 4. Negro Leagues: Lucas Boada played in the Negro Leagues, which were United States professional baseball leagues consisting of predominantly African American or Cuban players. These leagues operated separately from the Major League Baseball, mainly due to racial segregation in the United States during this era. 5. Teams: Lucas Boada played for two different teams within the Negro Leagues – the Cuban Stars (East) and the Cuban Stars (West). This information highlights his association with the Cuban Stars franchise, which had two separate teams in different regions. 6. Cuban Stars (East): Boada played for the Cuban Stars (East), which primarily organized games on the East Coast of the United States. It is one of the two Cuban Stars teams he played for during his career. 7. Cuban Stars (West): Similarly, Boada also played for the Cuban Stars (West), a team focused on games in the Midwest and the West Coast of the United States. This fact indicates that Boada represented both branches of the Cuban Stars brand during his time in the Negro Leagues. 8. Lack of Death Date: The bio does not provide a death date for Lucas Boada, which suggests that the exact date of his death could be unknown or not publicly available. This means that there is limited information available on Boada's personal life beyond his baseball career.

Which is fine—just not something I ordinarily do. I wanted to drink, smoke. Again, fine—but not something I ordinarily do. “Do I seem…okay?” I asked a colleague at work. A woman I barely knew. Insanely, I thought that since she worked with disabled students, many of whom struggled with mental illness, she would know mania when she saw it. This was a rather foolish assumption—especially since she's an educator, not a psychiatrist, especially with how skilled I am at wearing the mask of calm, the face of sanity. “You seem great, Julie. Cheery. Professional as always.” I let her reassurance placate me. Wanted to be placated. Yet, within months I lost my job. And not only that, but a chance at a scholarship, two really important long term friendships—relationships I'd enjoyed since high school. I was hospitalized three times between September and February. I lost my ability to trust myself, lost my mind. It is now a little over two years since I first felt that sliding. Twenty-six months since I knew that somewhere in the deepest parts of who I am, I was slipping. Nine seasons since I begged Dr. Poe, “Remember me to myself!” I'm still recuperating. Yes. I have felt like I wasn't me. Question: How did Julie come across to other people? === The answer to the above question is A:","completion":"Julie came across to other people as great, cheery, and professional as always, according to her colleague. However, this was a mask of calm and sanity that Julie wore, hiding her inner struggle with mental health and the feeling of slipping away from her true self."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Tim Burton remaking this sui generis movie is about as sensible as remaking Psycho - oh, that's right, some idiot already did that - I rest my case. Movie opens with chimpnaut blundering a simulation, proving he's not that smart from the outset. Marky Mark appears in shot without his characteristic underpants showing, then is turned down by a plain woman who prefers the touch of chimpanzees. The perfunctory establishing shot of the space station orbiting Saturn for no apparent reason, interior of ship a-bustle with genetic experiments on apes. Must we travel 1,300 million kilometers to Saturn to conduct these experiments? The special effects team decrees it. Marky's chimp gets lost in that staple of 60s sci-fi cinema - the Time Warp. Marky then demonstrates the space station's mind-boggling security ineptness by stealing a pod without anyone noticing, while simultaneously demonstrating his abject stupidity in mounting a deep-space rescue mission into a worm-hole for an expendable test chimp, with a million dollar vehicle with limited fuel and oxygen supplies. Before anyone can say \`Pointless Remake' Marky has surfed the worm-hole, crashed on an alien planet, removed his helmet without any thought to the lethality of the atmosphere and is being chased through a sound stage that almost resembles a lush rainforest, if it weren't for the kliegs backlighting the plastic trees. Surprise! It's APES doing the chasing - or at least, it *would* have been a surprise if no one saw Planet Of The Apes THIRTY-THREE YEARS AGO. Since Marky Mark did not get to show his pecs, take down his pants, or bust his lame whiteboy rap, he was characterless. Michael Clarke Duncan's gorilla teeth being inserted crookedly helped immensely in establishing *his* lack of character. Helena Bonham-Carter (aka irritating chimp activist), at a loss without a Shakespearean script, did a fine job of outdoing both Marky and Clarke as Most Cardboard Cutout. Paul Giamatti, the orangutan slave trader, secured the role of token comic relief and interspecies klutz. Though I have grown bilious in hearing puns relating to this movie, one review headline captured the essence of this Planet Of The Apes \`re-imagining': \`The Apes Of Roth'. While everyone else minced about looking like extras from One Million Years BC or Greystoke, Tim Roth, as Chimpanzee Thade, chews massive amounts of scenery and hurls kaka splendiferously. As entertaining as his portrayal of the psychotic Thade was, his character lacked a behavioral arc: Thade is mad when we first meet him... and he's pretty much at the same level of mad at film's end. Nice twist. The original POTA (1968) featured a leading character, Charlton Heston's Taylor, who was so disenchanted with mankind that he left earth for space with no regrets - yet as that film progressed, Taylor unwittingly found himself locked in a battle to prove mankind's worth - as their sole champion! The original film was ultimately a tale of humiliation, not salvation: when Taylor discovers the Statue of Liberty, he is forced to realize that his species had NOT prevailed. Is there anything that cerebral or ironic to Marky Mark's Leo? Or Roth's Thade? No, but there's lots of running. The slogans cry: Take Back The Planet .but it's the APES' planet. In this movie, humans and apes crash-landed here together, the humans having degenerated to cavepeople, allowing the apes to acquire speech and sensual body armor; the apes DESERVED to inherit the planet! Along comes Marky Mark, in true anthropocentric arrogance, taking it for granted that humans HAVE to be the apex predators, simply because they're there. \`Taking it back' is as ludicrous as apes landing here in 2001, complaining, \`A planet where men evolved from APES??!!' and then causing trouble with their overacting and hairy anuses. Heston was cast in the 1968 POTA because he had established his reputation as a maverick: he WAS Ben-Hur, Michelangelo, Moses! To cast him as the mute, dogged animal in an alien society was to stupefy an audience's expectations: how crazed must a world be where Our Man Charlton cannot command respect? Marky Mark has currently only established that he has tight underpants. Though Heston was denigrated constantly by the ape council, he dominated the screen with his charisma and stupendous overacting. When Marky Mark tries to instill fervor in the mongoloid humans, it's like that unpopular guy in school suddenly being made classroom monitor, who tells you to stop drawing penises on the blackboard and you throw a shoe at him. Burton tries to elevate Marky to humanity's icon, but he comes off as a chittering deviant. In the original film, the apes deem Taylor a deviant, yet he was, to audience and apes alike, an icon of humanity. That irony again. It was apt that a man who elevated scene-chewing to an acting technique - Heston - should play the father of this film's primo scene-chewer, Thaddeus Roth. As Roth's ape-dad, Charlton utters his own immortal lines, turned against the HUMANS this time, \`Damn them! Damn them all to hell!' The movie gets dumb and dumber towards the end. While Thaddeus is giving Marky an ass-beating lesson, a pod descends from on high with Marky's chimpnaut in it. Apes demonstrate their hebetude by bowing in obeisance to this incognizant creature, while Marky proves his own hebetude by muttering, \`Let's teach these monkeys about evolution.' Firstly, they're not monkeys, you ape! Secondly, it was genetic tampering and imbecilic plot fabrications which brought the apes to this point, not evolution. And what you intend to teach them by blowing them away with the concealed lasergun is called misanthropy, not evolution. Giving away the twist ending would only confuse viewers into believing that Estella Warren's half-nekkid role was actually integral to the plot (be still my pants.). No matter that he was humankind's last underpanted hope; in the end, cop apes take Marky away to Plot Point Prison where he was last heard ululating, \`It's a madhouse! A MADHOUSE!!...'

Insomnia Insomnia is the option most in line with common sense to answer the question, \\"What prevents a couple from going to bed?\\" Insomnia refers to the inability to fall asleep or stay asleep. This condition could prompt a couple to either postpone or have difficulty going to bed, as the inability to sleep could lead to restlessness, anxiety, or frustration for one or both partners. While the other options listed may have an impact on a couple's bedtime routine, these options do not generally prevent a couple from going to bed: B. Pregnancy: While pregnancy might cause some sleep disturbances due to discomfort, it does not inherently prevent a couple from going to bed. In fact, during pregnancy, it is essential for the expectant mother to have regular rest and sleep. C. Making love: Making love is an intimate act between a couple and might even promote sleep and relaxation, rather than preventing a couple from going to bed. D. Rest: Rest refers to a state of relaxation and is synonymous with sleep. As such, it is contradictory to suggest that rest would prevent a couple from going to bed. In fact, it is the very reason they would go to bed. E. Infant: Although having an infant might result in sleep disturbances due to the baby's needs and irregular sleep patterns, it does not prevent a couple from going to bed entirely. They may need to adjust their sleep schedules or wake up frequently to tend to their child, but they will still go to bed.

Both videos were shot in black-and-white in New York City and were directed by Jake Nava, with whom Beyoncé had worked on previous music videos including \\"Crazy in Love\\" and \\"Beautiful Liar\\". \\"Single Ladies\\" was choreographed by Frank Gatson Jr. and JaQuel Knight, and incorporates J-Setting choreography.

Write an article based on this summary: A drone came within 20ft (6m) of hitting a passenger jet on its final approach to London's Heathrow Airport, an aviation safety hearing was told. Article:","completion":"Title: Near Collision between Drone and Passenger Jet Raises Alarm on Aviation Safety Introduction: A recent incident involving a drone and a passenger jet near London's Heathrow Airport has reignited concerns over the potential risks that drones pose to aviation safety. Officials revealed during an aviation safety hearing that a drone came alarmingly close, within just 20ft (6m), of hitting a passenger jet as it made its final approach to the busy airport. Such incidents have highlighted the urgent need for stricter regulations and surveillance measures to prevent potentially catastrophic accidents in the future. Background: Unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, have become increasingly popular worldwide for both recreational and commercial purposes due to their affordability and versatility. However, as their usage becomes widespread, drone-related incidents involving aircraft have increased, putting authorities on high alert. London's Heathrow Airport, one of the busiest airports globally, has experienced several close calls with drones in recent years. In one of the most serious incidents, a drone narrowly missed colliding with a passenger jet carrying 130 passengers in 2018. Incidents like these not only pose real threats to the safety of passengers and flight crews but also raise significant concerns about possible terrorist attacks using drones to target commercial aircraft. The Incident: During the recent aviation safety hearing, it was revealed that the incident took place when the passenger jet was on its final approach to Heathrow Airport. Witnesses reported that the drone, which was flying at an altitude of around 300ft (90m), came within just 20ft of hitting the aircraft's fuselage. Investigations have been launched into the incident, with authorities pledging to identify and prosecute the drone's operator under the aviation regulations. It is as yet unclear how the drone managed to breach the airport's airspace and existing security measures in place without being detected, a factor that raises serious concerns about the effectiveness of such systems. Potential Risks: A mid-air collision between a drone and a jet has the potential to be disastrous, particularly if the drone were to get sucked into the engine or damage sensitive flight control systems such as the airplane's rudder, elevators, or ailerons. Such an impact could lead to a loss of control, putting the lives of hundreds of passengers and crew members at risk. Furthermore, the presence of rogue drones in the controlled airspace surrounding airports causes delays, cancellations, and diversions, all of which can lead to significant financial losses for airlines and airports. The psychological impact on passengers and flight crew who perceive a heightened sense of risk can also affect public confidence in the aviation industry. Regulatory Responses: Authorities worldwide have been grappling with the twin challenges of regulating drone usage while also encouraging innovation and growth in the industry. Regulations vary by country, and in the United Kingdom, drone operators are required to register their devices and pass a test. However, these measures have not proven to be foolproof. In response to the growing concerns over aviation safety, the UK government has implemented a series of measures designed to minimize the risk posed by drones. These include introducing a 5km (3.1mi) drone exclusion zone around airports and an altitude limit of 120m (400ft) for recreational drone use. Additionally, Heathrow and other airports have begun testing anti-drone technologies to better detect and respond to rogue drones straying into their airspace. Conclusion: Despite the efforts to tighten regulations and enhance surveillance, the recent near-miss at Heathrow Airport highlights the need for increased vigilance and cooperation between government agencies, technology developers, and the aviation industry.

Q:The answer to the question: What is the full name of the person with whom Patton continued discussing Bennett's condition while touring the remainder of the hospital? is inside the article: Private Paul G. Bennett, 21, of C Battery, U.S. 17th Field Artillery Regiment, was a four-year veteran of the U.S. Army, and had served in the division since March 1943. Records show he had no medical history until 6 August 1943, when a friend was wounded in combat. According to a report, he \\"could not sleep and was nervous.\\" Bennett was brought to the 93rd Evacuation Hospital. In addition to having a fever, he exhibited symptoms of dehydration, including fatigue, confusion, and listlessness. His request to return to his unit was turned down by medical officers. The shells going over him bothered him. The next day he was worried about his buddy and became more nervous. He was sent down to the rear echelon by a battery aid man and there the medical aid man gave him some medicine which made him sleep, but still he was nervous and disturbed. On the next day the medical officer ordered him to be evacuated, although the boy begged not to be evacuated because he did not want to leave his unit. On 10 August, Patton entered the receiving tent of the hospital, speaking to the injured there. Patton approached Bennett, who was huddled and shivering, and asked what the trouble was. \\"It's my nerves,\\" Bennett responded. \\"I can't stand the shelling anymore.\\" Patton reportedly became enraged at him, slapping him across the face. He began yelling: \\"Your nerves, hell, you are just a goddamned coward. Shut up that goddamned crying. I won't have these brave men who have been shot at seeing this yellow bastard sitting here crying.\\" Patton then reportedly slapped Bennett again, knocking his helmet liner off, and ordered the receiving officer, Major Charles B. Etter, not to admit him. Patton then threatened Bennett, \\"You're going back to the front lines and you may get shot and killed, but you're going to fight. If you don't, I'll stand you up against a wall and have a firing squad kill you on purpose. In fact, I ought to shoot you myself, you goddamned whimpering coward.\\" Upon saying this, Patton pulled out his pistol..., can you guess it ? A:","completion":"The full name of the person with whom Patton continued discussing Bennett's condition while touring the remainder of the hospital is Major Charles B. Etter. Patton ordered Major Etter not to admit Bennett to the hospital after their conversation and continued touring the hospital with him."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write highlights for this article: The daughter of a murdered California porn mogul has been sentenced to two years in prison for credit card fraud and identity theft. Jasmine Mitchell learned her fate Wednesday at San Francisco federal court. The 34-year-old Mitchell was arrested in February outside a Tiburon hotel on suspicion of obtaining cash advances in someone else's name. Off to jail: Jasmine Mitchell, 34, pictured in past mugshots, was sentenced to 27 months in prison after pleading guilty to credit card fraud and identity theft charges. Dark family history: Jasmine's father Artie Mitchell (left) and her uncle Jim Mitchell (right) were pioneers in the production of pornographic films in San Francisco. But in late February 1991, Jim shot his brother to death. A search revealed that Ms Mitchell was in possession of numerous fake credit cards. Three months after her arrest, Jasmine Mitchell skipped bail and ran away with her boyfriend, sparking a nationwide manhunt, which culminated on May 2 when sheriff's deputies cornered her in San Pablo. Mitchell managed to slip away on that occasion by ramming a deputy's car with her Mercedes-Benz, but police tracked her down six days later in Tiburon, San Jose Mercury News reported. She was indicted on fraud charges in May and entered a guilty plea in August, setting the stage for her sentencing this week. The woman is the daughter of Bay Area porn magnate Artie Mitchell, who was fatally shot by his brother and business partner in 1991 during a fight. As part of her plea deal, Mitchell will spend 27 months behind bars, followed by three years' probation. The 34-year-old former porn heiress also must pay more than 1million in restitution to two banks, Citibank and CIBC. Evidence: A detective points out the equipment seized from San Pablo apartment of Jasmine Mitchell, including an embossing machine (left) and a card press (right) Jasmine Mitchell was the alleged ringleader of a major identity theft operation that claimed thousands of victims. A public defender assigned to Mitchell's case blamed her bad decision-making on her addiction to methamphetamine, which she has been struggling with since 2004. According to the lawyer, Mitchell has been taking part in drug treatment programs and is 'genuinely contrite.' 'Ms. Mitchell very much needed a wake-up call and this case has provided it,' public defender Brandon LeBlanc wrote in a sentencing memorandum. Jasmine Mitchell's uncle, Jim Mitchell, died in 2007 after serving a manslaughter sentence in connection to her father's shooting death. The brothers produced in 1972 one of the first feature-length X-rated films, Behind the Green Door, and co-owned a still popular San Francisco strip club, The O'Farrell Theater. Art imitating life: In 2000, real-life brothers Charles Sheen (left) and Emilio Estevez (right) starred in a made-for-TV movie based on the lives of the Mitchell brothers. Trailblazers: The film focused on the making of the Mitchells' groundbreaking X-rated feature film, Behind the Green Door, released in 1972. In 2000, their story was dramatized in the movie Rated X starring real life brothers Charlie Sheen and Emilio Estevez. Jasmine Mitchell's cousin, Jim Mitchell's son James, is currently serving a 35-years-to-life sentence for killing the mother of his young daughter with a baseball bat in Novato in 2009. Highlights:","completion":"- Jasmine Mitchell, daughter of murdered California porn mogul Artie Mitchell, has been sentenced to 27 months in prison for credit card fraud and identity theft. - Mitchell, 34, allegedly led a major identity theft operation that claimed thousands of victims and was in possession of numerous fake credit cards. - As part of her plea deal, she must also pay over 1 million in restitution to Citibank and CIBC. - Mitchell's public defender attributes her criminal decision-making to a methamphetamine addiction. - Artie Mitchell and his brother Jim were pioneers in the production of pornographic films; their story was later dramatized in the movie Rated X."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend blog will know that I suffer from an extremely sensitive scalp which can be really itchy, and I have to be very careful what shampoo I use. I know that I’m sensitive to shampoos containing sodium laureth sulfate (also known as SLS, it’s the ingredient that makes shampoos, shower gels and soaps lather) but I’m also sensitive to some other ingredients in shampoos too – mainly fragrances. I had previously been using Rainforest Balance Shampoo and Conditioner from The Body Shop®, but I found the conditioner a bit too rich and my hair didn’t always feel totally clean after using it. So I started doing a bit of research into recommended natural shampoos – and this Sensitive Shampoo from Lavera kept coming up again and again! Several of the reviews I read said that this was the best shampoo for sensitive scalps and that it left hair feeling really clean and soft, so I decided to try it. The shampoo is a translucent peach-coloured gel that contains organic witch hazel and organic almond milk. It has quite a strong scent, but it’s a nice one so it doesn’t put me off. The shampoo feels creamy when you rub it together in your hands, but I did need quite a lot of it to get a good lather on my first application – the second application lathers a lot more easily. I definitely agree that this makes hair feel a lot cleaner than a lot of the other SLS-free shampoos that I’ve tried, my hair feels clean and full and soft when I’ve used it – the same way it would do if I were using a regular shampoo. I think it also helps my hair to dry more quickly and makes it easier to straighten too. But where this shampoo is outstanding is the way it makes my scalp feel – my scalp feels soothed and calm and there’s no hint of itching. I’ve been using Lavera Sensitive Shampoo for over a year now and I wouldn’t change it for the world, it’s definitely one of the best shampoos for a sensitive itchy scalp.

Answer the following question: Why may I be unhappy ?","completion":"Based on your statement and the choices provided, it can be inferred that your potential unhappiness may be due to a combination of factors. These factors could include high expectations of yourself, being overly competitive and driven, being a tightly wound person, as well as stress from limited social activities, sleep and compromising sanity. Let's break down these factors: 1. High expectations for yourself - You have clearly mentioned that you have set a certain benchmark for your performance, that is, obtaining a 2:1. Your high standards perhaps emanate from your innate predilection to succeed and do well. The pressure to meet these expectations can be quite intense and taxing on your mental health, leading to unhappiness if these expectations are not met. 2. Being overly competitive and driven - It appears you're highly motivated to achieve your goals, potentially to the point of competitiveness. This drive propels you forward and fuels your activities to accomplish what you have set out to do. However, the high levels of energy and focus required, coupled with the tension of keeping up the pace you've set for yourself, could also trigger unhappiness especially when confronted with lower achievements. 3. Being a tightly wound person - You mentioned that your sanity is limited, implying you are under significant stress. Being a tightly wound person usually means you might be more susceptive to stress and less flexible when dealing with unexpected setbacks or changes in your plans. This stress and inflexibility could exacerbate feelings of unhappiness, especially when outcomes don't align with your expectations. 4. Limited social activities and sleep - Humans are social animals and need interaction for emotional well-being. Additionally, lack of sleep can tremendously impact one's mood, cognitive function, and overall health. Both of these factors - isolation and sleep deprivation - can contribute to unhappiness. In summary, the potential sources of your unhappiness may be multifaceted, ranging from high self-expectations, an overly competitive and driven nature, a tightly-wound disposition, and the current limitations on social activities and sleep. However, it's important to remember that even in challenging times we can manage our stress levels and expectations to maintain our well-being. It may be beneficial for you to incorporate some self-care activities into your routine, practice patience with yourself, and maybe seek support when the pressure feels overwhelming."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The government wants parents to agree their child maintenance agreements \\"amicably\\" or face a charge. It said the changes were necessary as the old set-up was costly for taxpayers. But a charity said the changes could force some parents into \\"unstable\\" arrangements. Child maintenance is financial support that helps towards a child's living costs when its parents have separated. If parents split, maintenance should be paid to the person who takes care of the child on a day-to-day basis. Under the old system many single parents used the Child Support Agency (CSA) to sort out maintenance payments, but ministers announced last year the CSA would be abolished. A government spokesman said the old CSA was using an IT system that was \\"totally inadequate and notoriously riddled with defects\\", and as such it was costing £74 million per annum to run in operating costs alone. Source: Department for Work and Pensions The spokesman added that the old maintenance system \\"took responsibility away from parents, encouraging conflict and hostility at huge expense to the taxpayer\\". In an effort to improve the situation the new replacement \\"Child Maintenance Service\\" has been gradually rolled out, which the government said is designed to act as a backstop for parents having trouble. This week more than 50,000 letters are being sent out by the Department for Work and Pensions to parents in England, Scotland and Wales who currently pay and receive child maintenance through the old CSA. Ministers want to encourage people to come to voluntary arrangements but if that is not possible - and the new statutory service is used - then both parties will be charged. Under the new rules if an amicable arrangement cannot be reached the paying parent - usually the father - will have a 20% fee added to the maintenance payment, while the receiving parent will pay 4% to get the money. The charges will be introduced later this year, and all single parents will be charged an upfront fee of £20 for registering with the new service. However, the chief executive of the single-parent charity Gingerbread, Fiona Weir, said she was \\"concerned\\" by the reforms. She said: \\"While many parents are able to agree private child maintenance arrangements, for many other parents, this just isn't possible without government help. \\"We're very concerned that closing CSA cases and bringing in charges may deter some parents from making new child maintenance agreements or pressure single parents into unstable arrangements, and children will lose out on vital support.\\" For further help and assistance with child maintenance parents can visit www.cmoptions.org.

They want parents to agree on how to take care of their child's costs when they separate, in a friendly manner. The old system, called the Child Support Agency (CSA), is going away because it was too expensive and had issues with technology. A new system called the Child Maintenance Service is taking its place. But if parents cannot agree peacefully on how to pay for their child's needs, they will need to pay extra fees.

Information: - Amon Düül was a German political art commune formed out of the student movement of the 1960s that became well known for its free-form musical improvisations. This spawned two rock groups, Amon Düül (sometimes referred to as \\"Amon Düül I\\") and the more famous Amon Düül II. After both groups disbanded in the 1970s, some of the original members reunited in the 1980s under the name Amon Düül again, though this incarnation is commonly referred to as Amon Düül (UK) to avoid confusion with the original one. - Krautrock (sometimes called \\"kosmische Musik\\") is a broad genre of experimental rock that developed in Germany in the late 1960s. The term \\"krautrock\\" was originated by English-speaking music journalists as a humorous name for a diverse range of German bands whose music drew from sources such as psychedelic rock, avant-garde electronic music, funk, minimalism, jazz improvisation, and world music styles. Largely divorced from the traditional blues and rock and roll influences of British and American rock music up to that time, the period contributed to the evolution of electronic music and ambient music as well as the birth of post-punk, alternative rock and new-age music. Important acts of the scene include Can, Kraftwerk, Neu!, Ash Ra Tempel, Tangerine Dream, and Faust. - Amon Düül II (or Amon Düül 2) is a German rock band. The group is generally considered to be one of the founders of the Krautrock scene and a seminal influence on its development. - Carnival in Babylon is an LP by German rock artists Amon Düül II which was released in 1972 . It was recorded at the Bavaria Studio ( engineer Peter Kramper ) and remixed at Studio 70 ( engineer Jürgen Koppers ) . It was produced by Olaf Kübler and Amon Düül II.

Write an article based on this \\"A father has been accused of murdering his newborn baby son, who died a month after being taken to hospital with serious injuries.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: A Tragic Loss: Father Accused of Murdering Newborn Son Introduction In a shocking and heartbreaking turn of events, a father has been accused of the unthinkable – murdering his newborn baby boy, who succumbed to his injuries a month after being admitted to the hospital. The news has left the community and the nation reeling, struggling to grapple with the horror of the situation. While the details of the case continue to emerge, questions about the role of mental health, societal pressures, and systemic failures arise as we grieve the tragic loss of an innocent life. Events Leading Up to the Crime The accused, whose identity has been withheld for legal reasons, and his partner welcomed their baby boy into the world with great joy and anticipation. However, their excitement soon turned into despair as the situation took a darker turn. When their baby was a few days old, he was taken to the hospital, suffering from severe injuries. The medical staff suspected that the baby's injuries were non-accidental, and investigations seemed to suggest that the father could be responsible. The father's erratic behavior, combined with his newborn son's critical condition, led the authorities to apprehend him, and he was subsequently charged with attempted murder. Loss of Innocent Life Despite the best efforts of the hospital to save the baby's life, his injuries proved too severe, and he tragically passed away one month after being admitted. The child's devastating death weighed heavily on the hearts and minds of those involved, and the initial charge of attempted murder was subsequently upgraded to murder. As the investigation continues, the accused father faces the possibility of a lengthy prison sentence, or even life imprisonment if convicted. Community Response and Mental Health Concerns This tragic case struck a chord with communities all over the nation, igniting conversations about the importance of supporting new parents and addressing mental health issues before they escalate into such heinous acts. Stressors like sleep deprivation, financial strain, and societal pressure are known to cause distress to new parents, posing risks to both their mental health and the wellbeing of their children. The accused father's motives remain a matter of speculation, but his act of violence could be linked to undiagnosed or untreated mental health issues. New parents must receive adequate support from society, policymakers, and professionals alike to help identify and address mental health risks early on to prevent tragedies like this from occurring. Systemic Failures and the Need for Reform In the wake of this horrifying event, lawmakers and child welfare advocates called for an urgent review of child protection systems and parental education – something that may have been overlooked or underfunded in the past. While it is essential to hold individuals accountable for their actions, it is also crucial to recognize the system's potential deficits, which failed to protect a vulnerable infant from harm. Parental education and resources for mental health must receive sufficient funding and attention, tailored to supporting individuals facing the stressors of parenthood. By evaluating existing protocols, providing resources, and prioritizing mental healthcare, society may prevent such disastrous consequences for vulnerable children and families in the future. Conclusion The untimely death of a newborn baby at the hands of his father is a tragic event that impacts an entire community and sends shockwaves throughout the nation. The case raises questions about parental support, mental health awareness, and the efficacy of child protection services, which must be addressed in order to prevent further catastrophic incidents like this one. As we grieve the loss of a precious life, we must work together as a society to recognize and address the root causes of this tragedy in order to create a safer and healthier environment for families and their vulnerable infants."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

After the end of World War II, the three go for different lives: Nicola in Nocera Inferiore (southern Italy), Antonio in Rome and Gianni in Pavia. Later, both Antonio and Gianni fall in love with young Luciana (Sandrelli), and through their relationships go back to the history of post-war Italy, along with the related hopes and disappointments. Gianni, now a lawyer's assistant, moves to Rome and arranges to marry the semi-illiterate daughter of a construction tycoon with questionable fame, a former fascist who managed to get good connections with the pro-American conservative Christian democratic party dominating public life (and building licenses) in post-war Italy. His wife, resenting her inadequacy, tries to turn into the woman he longs for but ultimately fails and dies in a car accident.

Here is a news article: The U.S. system for checking suspicious travelers and airport security came under new scrutiny Sunday after an alleged terrorist bent on destroying a jetliner was thwarted only by a malfunctioning detonator and some quick-thinking passengers. An apparent malfunction in a device designed to detonate the high explosive PETN may have been all that saved the 278 passengers and the crew aboard Northwest Flight 253 on Christmas Day. No undercover air marshal was on board and passengers subdued the suspect, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, 23, of Nigeria. Abdulmutallab was hospitalized with burns from the attack and was read an indictment filed Saturday in federal court in Detroit charging him with attempting to destroy or wreck an aircraft and placing a destructive device in a plane. He was released from the hospital Sunday to the custody of federal marshals, who would not reveal where he was being held. But his lawyer said he was being held at a federal prison in Milan, Mich. Adding to the airborne jitters, a second Nigerian man was detained Sunday from the same Northwest flight to Detroit after he locked himself in the plane's bathroom. Officials reported that he was belligerent but genuinely sick, and that, in an abundance of caution, the plane was taken to a remote location for screening before passengers were let off. Investigators concluded he posed no threat. In November, Abdulmutallab had been placed in a database of more than 500,000 names of people suspected of terrorist ties. But officials say there was not enough information about his terror activity that would have placed him on a watch list that could have kept him from flying. 'Sacrificing himself' Officials said he came to the attention of U.S. intelligence last month when his father, a prominent Nigerian banker, reported to the American Embassy in Nigeria about his son's increasingly extremist views. CNBC's Erin Burnett reported in Abuja, Nigeria, that family members had told her that Abdulmutallab's father had told embassy officials in a letter that his son had spoken of \\"sacrificing himself.\\" Still, in appearances on Sunday talk shows, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said the traveling public \\"is very, very safe.\\" \\"This was one individual literally of thousands that fly and thousands of flights every year,\\" Napolitano said. \\"And he was stopped before any damage could be done. I think the important thing to recognize here is that once this incident occurred, everything happened that should have.\\" Even so, airport security and intelligence played no role in thwarting the plot. Abdulmutallab was carrying PETN, also known as pentaerythritol, the same material convicted shoe bomber Richard Reid used when he tried to destroy a trans-Atlantic flight in 2001 with explosives hidden in his shoes. Abdulmutallab is alleged to have carried the explosive in condom-like pouches attached to his body. Despite being in the database of people with suspected terrorist ties, Abdulmutallab, who comes from a prominent and wealthy Nigerian family, had a multiple-entry U.S. visa. It was issued last year. Napolitano said Abdulmutallab was properly screened before getting on the flight to Detroit from Amsterdam. Reviewing detection systems The administration is also investigating aviation detection systems to see how the alleged attacker managed to get on board the Northwest flight in Amsterdam with explosive materials, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said. Video: Would-be bomber’s family speaks out No other flights were known to have been targeted. However, Gibbs says federal authorities took precautionary steps \\"to assume and plan for the very worst.\\" Napolitano said there is no indication yet Abdulmutallab is part of a larger terrorist plot, although his possible ties to al-Qaida are still under investigation. The United States is reviewing what security measures were used in Amsterdam where he boarded the flight. \\"Now the forensics are being analyzed with what could have been done,\\" Napolitano said. Additional security measures are in place at airports around the world that are likely to slow travelers. Napolitano advised getting to airports earlier. Congress is preparing to hold hearings on what happened and whether rules need to be changed. \\"It's amazing to me that an individual like this who was sending out so many signals could end up getting on a plane going to the U.S.,\\" said Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader in the Senate. On Saturday, two Middle Eastern men thought to have been acting suspicious aboard a flight bound for Phoenix were detained and questioned by federal anti-terrorism authorities before being released. That incident — and Sunday's incident in Detroit — led the Council on American-Islamic Relations to urge airline security personnel to avoid ethnic and religious profiling. Gibbs appeared on ABC television's \\"This Week,\\" NBC's \\"Meet the Press\\" and CBS' \\"Face the Nation.\\" Napolitano spoke on CNN's \\"State of the Union\\" as well as on NBC and ABC. McConnell appeared on ABC. ||||| The suspect in the attempted bombing of Northwest Flight 253 used a highly explosive substance called PETN, a law enforcement official toldSaturday. The explosives were carried in a soft plastic container - possibly a condom - though much of the packaging was destroyed in the fire, the official said. The FBI is questioning the suspect, identified as 23-year-old Nigerian Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who claimed to be acting on orders from al Qaeda to blow up the airliner, officials said. A high-ranking law enforcement official told CBS News that the suspect apparently used a syringe to inject a chemical into the powder, which was located near his groin. It is a technique and it's possible that this incident was a test of whether the materials could pass screening and how effective they might be at causing damage, the source said. According to Encyclopedia Brittanica, PETN is a highly explosive, colorless organic compound, and is related to nitroglycerin. Introduced as an explosive after World War I, PETN is \\"valued for its shattering force and efficiency ... and is the least stable of the common military explosives but retains its properties in storage for longer periods than nitroglycerin or cellulose nitrate (nitrocellulose) does.\\" PETN is also used in heart medication as a stimulant.

Safety in the Air Fight 253 Terror Scare Obama Monitors 'Terror' Attempt The attack began with a pop and a puff of smoke - sending passengers scrambling to subdue the suspect. Travelers said they smelled smoke, saw a glow, and heard what sounded like firecrackers. At least one person climbed over others and jumped on the man, who officials say was trying to ignite an explosive device. \\"It sounded like a firecracker in a pillowcase,\\" said Peter Smith, a passenger from the Netherlands. \\"First there was a pop, and then (there) was smoke.\\" The passenger who pounced on the suspect was later , a director from Amsterdam. In extinguishing the explosive device, Schuringa told CNN he suffered minor burns to his hands. Afterward, the suspect was taken to a front-row seat with his pants cut off and his legs burned. Authorities told CBS News he suffered third-degree burns. The White House said it believed it was an attempted act of terrorism and stricter security measures were quickly imposed on airline travel. Dutch anti-terrorism authorities said the U.S. has asked all airlines to take extra precautions on flights worldwide that are bound for the United States. The incident was reminiscent of Richard Reid, who tried to destroy a trans-Atlantic flight in 2001 with explosives hidden in his shoes, but was subdued by other passengers. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"The U.S. system for checking suspicious travelers and airport security has been put under scrutiny after an alleged terrorist attempt to destroy Northwest Flight 253 on Christmas Day was thwarted by a malfunctioning detonator and quick-thinking passengers.

Movie title: A Single Man Movie plot: Taking place over the course of a single day, November 30, 1962, a month after the Cuban missile crisis, A Single Man is the story of George Falconer (Colin Firth), a middle-aged English college professor living in Los Angeles. George dreams that he encounters the body of his longtime partner, Jim (Matthew Goode), at the scene of the car accident that took Jim's life eight months earlier. After awakening, George delivers a voiceover discussing the pain and depression he has endured since Jim's death and his intention to commit suicide that evening. George receives a phone call from his dearest friend, Charley (Julianne Moore), who projects lightheartedness despite her being equally miserable. George goes about his day putting his affairs in order and focusing on the beauty of isolated events, believing he is seeing things for the last time. Throughout, there are flashbacks to George and Jim's sixteen-year-long relationship. During the school day George comes into contact with a student, Kenny Potter (Nicholas Hoult), who shows interest in George and disregards conventional boundaries of student-professor discussion. George also forms an unexpected connection with a Spanish male prostitute, Carlos (Jon Kortajarena). That evening George meets Charley for dinner. Though they initially reminisce and amuse themselves by dancing, Charley's desire for a deeper relationship with George and her failure to understand his relationship with Jim angers George. George goes to a bar and discovers that Kenny has followed him. They get a round of drinks, go skinny dipping, and then return to George's house and continue drinking. George passes out and wakes up alone in bed with Kenny asleep in another room. George gets up and while watching Kenny discovers that he had fallen asleep holding George's gun, taken from the desktop, to keep George from committing suicide. George locks the gun away, burns his suicide notes and in a closing voiceover explains how he has rediscovered the ability \\"to feel, rather than think\\". As he...

Q:This article: The inaugural games were held, on the orders of the Roman Emperor Titus, to celebrate the completion in AD 80 (81 according to some sources) of the Colosseum, then known as the Flavian Amphitheatre (Latin: Amphitheatrum Flavium). Vespasian began construction of the amphitheatre around AD 70 and it was completed by his son Titus who became emperor following Vespasian's death in AD 79. Titus' reign began with months of disasters – including the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, a fire in Rome, and an outbreak of plague – he inaugurated the completion of the structure with lavish games that lasted for more than one hundred days, perhaps in an attempt to appease the Roman public and the gods. Little literary evidence survives of the activities of the gladiatorial training and fighting (ludi). They appear to have followed the standard format of the Roman games: animal entertainments in the morning session, followed by the executions of criminals around midday, with the afternoon session reserved for gladiatorial combats and recreations of famous battles. The animal entertainments, which featured creatures from throughout the Roman Empire, included extravagant hunts and fights between different species. Animals also played a role in some executions which were staged as recreations of myths and historical events. Naval battles formed part of the spectacles but whether these took place in the amphitheatre or on a lake that had been specially constructed by Augustus is a topic of debate among historians. Only three contemporary or near-contemporary accounts of the games survive. The works of Suetonius and Cassius Dio focus on major events, while Martial provides some fragments of information on individual entertainments and the only detailed record of a gladiatorial combat in the arena known to survive: the fight between Verus and Priscus. contains an answer for the question: What games lasted for more than one hundred days?, what is it ?

David brings his eight-year-old son Billy (Nathan Gamble) and Norton to a grocery store, where the patrons notice unusual police and military activity. Moments after a panicked and injured man, Dan (Jeffrey DeMunn), runs in warning of danger, a thick mist envelopes the store, accompanied by earthquake-like tremors and the town's tornado siren. A man disregards the warnings and is attacked while running to his car. A mentally unstable religious woman, Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden), decides that this is the beginning of Armageddon. A shaken woman (Melissa McBride), against objections from the others, leaves the store to go home to her children and disappears. While investigating the store's generator, a bag-boy named Norm (Chris Owen) volunteers to go outside, but is snatched and pulled into the mist by a tentacle connected to an unseen monster. Norton heads outside with a small group to seek help, only to be attacked and killed, prompting the rest of the survivors to barricade the shop-front windows. That night, enormous insects land on the windows and pterodactyl-like animals attack them, breaking the glass and allowing the creatures to begin fighting inside the store.

Article: Iran is home to one of the world's oldest civilizations, beginning with the formation of the Proto-Elamite and Elamite kingdoms in 3200–2800 BC. The Iranian Medes unified the area into the first of many empires in 625 BC, after which it became the dominant cultural and political power in the region. Iran reached the pinnacle of its power during the Achaemenid Empire founded by Cyrus the Great in 550 BC, which at its greatest extent comprised major portions of the ancient world, stretching from parts of the Balkans (Thrace-Macedonia, Bulgaria-Paeonia) and Eastern Europe proper in the west, to the Indus Valley in the east, making it the largest empire the world had yet seen. The empire collapsed in 330 BC following the conquests of Alexander the Great. The Parthian Empire emerged from the ashes and was succeeded by the Sassanid Dynasty in 224 AD, under which Iran again became one of the leading powers in the world, along with the Roman-Byzantine Empire, for a period of more than four centuries.

The final episode of this season is titled \\"Remember Me as a Time of Day\\" and aired on May 18, 2009. In the storyline, Lucas (played by Chad Michael Murray) and Peyton (played by Hilarie Burton) leave the fictional town of Tree Hill, North Carolina, to start a new life with their newborn daughter, Sawyer Brooke Scott. Leading up to their departure, the couple faced numerous challenges, including relationship complications, life-threatening health issues, and personal growth struggles, which endeared them to the show's audience. The characters' departure from the series was due in part to the actors' contract negotiations and the eventual decision not to renew their contracts. Hence, both Chad Michael Murray and Hilarie Burton did not return as series regulars for Season 7 of One Tree Hill. This decision caused some disappointment among fans, as Lucas and Peyton had been pivotal characters since the show's inception in 2003. However, the series continued for three more seasons without them, focusing on the remaining core characters, such as Brooke Davis (played by Sophia Bush), Nathan Scott (played by James Lafferty), and Haley James Scott (played by Bethany Joy Lenz), as well as introducing new characters.

Remove the plastic wrap from the dish.","completion":"Title: Mouthwatering Microwave Corn: A Quick and Easy Recipe Introduction: As the summer months are approaching and picnics become more frequent, corn stands tall as one of the most beloved seasonal vegetables. It’s a versatile food that easily complements various dishes, from savory barbecues to refreshing salads. While boiling and grilling corn are undoubtedly popular cooking methods, microwaving offers an easy and convenient way to prepare this delicious treat. Read on to learn more about how to cook mouthwatering corn in the microwave, and get ready to savor this sweet and juicy vegetable. Ingredients: - Fresh corn on the cob (as many cobs as you want) - Water (2 tablespoons per cob) - Microwave-safe baking dish - Plastic wrap - Fork - Optional toppings (butter, salt, pepper, etc.) Instructions: 1. Prepare the corn: Before diving into the cooking process, clean and prepare your corn by removing the husks and silks. Properly removing the husk is crucial, as it not only affects the taste but also ensures your corn cooks evenly. Rinse the cobs under cold water to remove any remaining silk strands. 2. Get the dish ready: Select a microwave-safe baking dish that's large enough to accommodate all the corn cobs you plan to cook. Ensure there’s enough space, so they don't overlap with one another. Remember, proper spacing helps with even cooking. 3. Add water and corn: Pour 2 tablespoons of water into the baking dish for each corn cob you're preparing. Gently place your corn cobs in the dish, ensuring they lay flat and spaced out. The water helps create steam during microwaving, which allows the corn to cook evenly and prevents it from drying out. 4. Cover and vent: Next, cover the baking dish with a sheet of plastic wrap. Make sure the wrap seals the edges of the dish to effectively trap the steam inside. Using a fork or a sharp knife, poke a small vent hole into the plastic wrap to release excess steam during the cooking process and avoid unnecessary messes. 5. Cooking time: Microwave the corn-filled dish on high for about 4 to 6 minutes, depending on the power of your microwave and the number of cobs you're cooking. Keep an eye on your corn to ensure it does not overcook, as this may result in dry, tough kernels. 6. Check for doneness: After about 4 minutes, pause the microwave and briefly lift the plastic wrap to check the corn's texture. The kernels should be bright yellow and tender. If the corn is not ready, continue microwaving in one-minute increments until it reaches your desired level of doneness. 7. Remove carefully: Using oven mitts or a towel, carefully remove the hot baking dish from the microwave. Gently uncover the dish by lifting one edge of the plastic wrap, being cautious of the steam that will escape. Discard the plastic wrap. 8. Serve and enjoy: Your perfectly cooked corn is now ready to be served. Feel free to add your favorite toppings such as butter, salt, pepper, or herbs of your choice. For a fun twist, try concocting a flavored butter by combining melted butter with garlic, lime zest, or even spicy chipotle powder. Conclusion: With this quick and easy microwave corn recipe, never miss out on the sweet taste of perfectly cooked corn on the cob. Ideal for busy weekday dinners or spontaneous backyard barbecues, delight in this scrumptious, time-saving dish that pairs well with virtually any meal. Savor the goodness of summer corn, and get ready to impress family and friends with this effortless cooking method."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

News article: The first rule of menstruation etiquette is you don’t talk about menstruation, particularly to men. If you must discuss your period you do so quietly and euphemistically. When you’re surfing the crimson wave and have to go to the bathroom, you make sure your period paraphernalia is carefully concealed so people remain clueless about your condition. The biggest breach of menstrual etiquette, however, is leaking in public. Luckily technology has stepped in to save women from their unpredictable uteri. A new startup called my.Flow promises a “solution to menstruation mortification” and “a girl’s worst nightmare of having blood leak through her new white pants”. You might think the solution would be tearing down the culture of shame that exists around menstruation. But, no: it’s a Bluetooth wearable device that tracks the saturation of your tampon and lets you know, via a mobile app, when to change it. my.Flow is the latest product of a modern mania for putting a chip in things and connecting them to the internet. This feeds into another internet-era enthusiasm: quantifying our lives. Fitness trackers measure your steps; smart cups measure your sips; smart beds measure your sleep. By 2020 it’s estimated there will be 38.5bn smart and connected devices. And if my.Flow has anything to do with it one of those smart, connected devices will be our vaginas. my.Flow won’t launch until 2017, but I had a chance to see Amanda Field, the 29-year-old CEO, demonstrate a model of the product last week. Field first came up with my.Flow during a class project on wearables at UC Berkley. After graduating she successfully pitched the idea to HAX, the world’s largest hardware accelerator, and was sent to their campus in China to develop the prototype. No one from the original class project could accompany her, but a friend working on a “smart vibrator” connected Field to Jacob McEntire, now her co-founder. The two of them flew to China in January; when I met Field she had only just returned from the demonstration the night before. So how exactly do you demonstrate a wearable period monitor? With a “drip-rig”, apparently: a bottle of purple liquid and a fake vagina. Why purple? Well, says Field, “in pad commercials it’s usually blue so we wanted it to be a little more realistic. We thought we’d go for red but didn’t want to alienate anyone. We want to change the conversation [around periods] but we’re not looking to cause a revolt. So we mixed blue with red. It meets in the middle.” This prevarication around the right way to challenge menstruation etiquette, the desire to be revolutionary – but not revolting! – results in a sort of confusion as to whether my.Flow is breaking down menstruation stigmas, or monetizing and reinforcing them. With enough users, the data will represent an unprecedented amount of information about women’s menstrual flows Professor Christina Bobel, president of the Society for Menstrual Cycle Research notes the product “accommodates the culture of silence and taboo around menstruation by allowing the menstruator to pass as non-menstruating. Look, I live in the real world so I appreciate how nice it is not to leak but … we seem to be moving in the direction of ‘my body is a problem to be solved’. The only way I can manage it, not even enjoy it, is through buying stuff.” The extent to which we’re marketed a menstruation mentality is echoed by Elissa Stein, co-author of Flow: The Cultural Story of Menstruation. “The whole language of menstruation was created by advertisers to sell products,” says Stein. “Because if advertisers can create shame they can use their products to solve it.” In Stein’s opinion, my.Flow bolsters this. “Menstrual mortification!” she exclaims, referencing the copy on my.Flow’s website “if that’s not a slap in your face … It’s the same message women have been sold for decades. That menstruation is something to be ashamed and afraid of. We’re going to sell you something to keep your secret.” The irony is that my.Flow may do more to advertise your secret than keep it. It works via a wearable device about the size of a small key fob that attaches to your waistband or belt. So, yep, you’re walking around with a period monitor on your waist trying to make sure nobody knows you have your period. The wearable serves as the communication station between the my.Flow app on your phone and a special “companion tampon”, which has an elongated string containing medical-grade conductive steel. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Amanda Field was sent to their campus in China to develop the prototype. Photograph: my.Flow Once you insert the tampon, you thread the end of the string into the wearable device then wirelessly pair the wearable with your phone. Finally you program the app to send you a notification when your tampon is a certain percentage full. The notification can say whatever you like, whether that’s “call aunt Flo” or “you are about to rain down blood on the boardroom floor”. While it’s useful to know how full your tampon is, most women gradually become attuned to the ebb and flow of their cycle without technological assistance. Will women really want to go through all this rigmarole for more granular information? Field thinks so. We don’t know how big an issue anxiety about staining is, she says, because we don’t talk about it. The culture of silence around menstruation means pitching the product to investors has had its challenges. Most of the male VCs (something of a tautology since 93% of partners at top venture capital firms are male) she encountered didn’t even know how a tampon worked. Field notes that “women who were older and post-menopausal were pretty confused as well. Like … is this something that’s really necessary?’” Despite the cynics, however, Field says virtually “every woman we talked to has told us that this will be something that they’re standing in line to get”. If you are standing in line for my.Flow, how much will it cost? First, there’s the one-time purchase of the wearable at around 49. Then there are the companion tampons; my.Flow is currently negotiating with a major tampon brand to have these manufactured. They will be priced at a few dollars more than regular tampons – which already cost women at least 60 a year. With all the current controversy around the luxury tax on tampons shouldn’t we be focusing on lowering prices rather than increasing them? Field says she is cognizant of this and “wanted to make sure we weren’t marking up too much, [which is] why we’re going for a lower price point than we could”. Further, Field believes that you’re paying not just to reduce anxiety around stain-shame but also to reduce potential risks of infection and toxic shock syndrome (TSS) from tampons that have been left in too long. TSS is extremely rare and tampon use is a factor in less than half of cases. Nevertheless, it remains a concern and Field cites a case earlier this year in which a 20-year-old developed TSS after leaving her tampon in for nine days and almost died. The culture of silence around menstruation means pitching the product to male investors has had its challenges. The app may promote safer tampon use but it doesn’t solve the bigger problems around tampon use. First there are the environmental hazards; each year 7m tampons are dumped into US landfills. Then there are the broader health hazards. 70% of western women use tampons; each of these women will insert around 12,000 tampons into her body over her lifetime, with each tampon staying in highly absorbent vaginal membrane for a number of hours. Yet few women have any idea exactly what it is that they’re actually inserting; there’s no contents list on a box of tampons. Independent studies have found them to contain carcinogens and toxins – tampon manufacturer-funded studies, unsurprisingly, have declared these to be safe. Ultimately, nobody really knows the risks of cumulative tampon risk. This is where my.Flow may prove most useful: the product has the potential to open up new avenues of research into women’s health. The app stores all your menstruation data – not just the frequency and length of your cycle as other period trackers do – but the changes in your flow. Should my.Flow attract enough users the aggregated data will represent an unprecedented amount of information about women’s menstrual flows which could yield valuable insights. McEntire, the co-founder of my.Flow and lead hardware engineer, also believes that translating menstrual flow into data will help propel research in the area by reducing embarrassment: “It provides a level of abstraction which means people can treat menstruation like any other personal health data.” But with great data comes great responsibility. While the app might reduce your risk of blood leaks what about the risk of personal data leaks? Fitbit caused some of its users a lot of embarrassment a few years ago by inadvertently having their sex stats show up in Google search. Then there’s the possibility, as with all “smart” devices, of hacking. Although as Mike Ryan, an expert in the security of connected devices, notes, the worst that could really happen here is that a hacker tricks the app into thinking a tampon is full. “If a woman begins to rely on this technology too much … then the attacker could cause her to make a mess.” Over the last 18 months, there’s been a groundswell of innovation and conversation around menstruation. New women-led menstruation solutions like Thinx period panties have emerged and adverts for sanitary products have become a lot more straight-talking. While this is all cause for celebration we need to be careful not to conflate product innovation with social innovation. New products aren’t going to break down menstrual taboos, education is. Real progress isn’t an app that tells you when to change your tampon; it’s being able to walk to the bathroom, tampon conspicuously in hand, without anyone batting an eyelid. ||||| The internet of things is trying to get all up in our business. There are internet-connected pregnancy tests, smart vibrators and Kegel exercisers, and now, there are tampons that connect to your smartphone. Called My.Flow, the startup aims to solve the problem of leaking on your period. It can be annoying and potentially embarrassing to bleed through a tampon and have it appear on your clothes. My.Flow My.Flow is a Bluetooth-connected tampon system that monitors your saturation and will alert you on your mobile device when it’s time to change your tampon, quelling a fear that many women experience. It's set to launch in 2017. But is it really a helpful solution or yet another ridiculous IoT product that, instead of supporting women and removing the stigma surrounding menstruation, just reinforces the idea that periods are something to fear? The tampon has a six to 12-inch string reinforced with conductive steel. The tampon communicates via a wearable you place on your waist, which kind of defeats the purpose of a discreet period-tracking system. And connecting the tampon to track it sounds woefully complicated. The Guardian explains: Once you insert the tampon, you thread the end of the string into the wearable device then wirelessly pair the wearable with your phone. Finally you program the app to send you a notification when your tampon is a certain percentage full. The notification can say whatever you like, whether that’s “call aunt Flo” or “you are about to rain down blood on the boardroom floor”. About 70 percent of women use tampons, and at a store like Walgreens, they cost about 8 per box. We’re already investing a lot into the sanitary products, and My.Flow is asking users to pay even more. The device costs “around 49,” and the smart tampons will be more expensive than your average cotton ones. Most women eventually become attune to their biological systems and the natural flow of menstruation, so while the “menstruation mortification” that the app supposedly solves could be embarrassing on occasion, it doesn’t necessarily happen regularly. Fundamentally, My.Flow seems to be catering to the fears and stereotypes surrounding menstruation shaming. Don’t talk about your period; don’t let anyone know you have it; and don’t accidentally bleed through your pants! Even the demonstration that the Guardian explains is counter-intuitive. Instead of using red liquid, for realism, the founders demonstrated the app with purple fluid so as not to be revolting. It’s great that more companies are moving to incorporate women’s health into apps and services that previously neglected them, including Apple Health. But to put so much emphasis on hiding or reducing the “mortification,” of periods only serves to further the stigma surrounding them. Tampon Run, the mobile game developed by a pair of teenage girls who want to destigmatize periods through games, is a perfect example of properly pairing mobile with menstruation. If we really want to support women’s health in the increasingly connected world, it’s not necessarily going to be done through IoT devices that alert us when we need to change our tampons. It will be done through education and acceptance. And, perhaps, even bleeding through our pants every once in a while and being totally okay with it.

Tollinger is a professional town tamer - as in, when a town needs someone to save itself; he is the one who is brought in to do it. Tollinger's latest gig comes by as an accident: strolling into town looking for his former fling, he stumbles into a town being played like a puppet by a local western gangster. But many townspeople begin to rue the day they hired Tollinger, as his way of cleaning up the town becomes very taxing (suddenly High Plains Drifter seems less original). Man With The Gun starts off as an average western tough-guy film but begins to surprise you more and more as the film progresses. What starts off as forgettable and run-of-the-mill ends up dark and character-centered. The entire film is very well shot and the cast is very enjoyable. Mitchum is his usual excellent self here in Man With The Gun - not one of his very best performances, Mitchum still has his classic and effective tough-guy screen presence in high gear and he knocks the action-packed, meaningful, and shocking scenes of the film right out of the park.

Beginning on December 11, 1945, Stafford hosted the Tuesday and Thursday broadcasts of NBC musical variety radio program The Chesterfield Supper Club. On April 5, 1946, the entire cast, including Stafford and Perry Como, participated in the first commercial radio broadcast from an airplane. The initial plan was to use the stand-held microphones used in studios but when these proved to be problematic, the cast switched to hand-held microphones, which because of the plane's cabin pressure became difficult to hold. Three flights were made that day; a rehearsal in the afternoon, then two in the evening—one for the initial 6:00 pm broadcast and another at 10:00 pm for the West Coast broadcast.Stafford moved from New York to California in November 1946, continuing to host Chesterfield Supper Club from Hollywood. In 1948, she restricted her appearances on the show to Tuesdays, and Peggy Lee hosted the Thursday broadcasts. Stafford left the show when it was expanded to 30 minutes, making her final appearance on September 2, 1949. She returned to the program in 1954; it ended its run on NBC Radio the following year. During her time with Chesterfield Supper Club, Stafford revisited some of the folk music she had enjoyed as a child. Weston, her conductor on the programme, suggested using some of the folk music for the show. With her renewed interest in folk tunes came an interest in folklore; Stafford established a contest to award a prize to the best collection of American folklore submitted by a college student. The annual Jo Stafford Prize for American Folklore was handled by the American Folklore Society, with the first prize of 250 awarded in 1949.

Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: Where did the remains of the water supply systems give historians a picture of the prevailing surface water distribution methods?, using the article: On the battlefield, the king's commanders led the troops. The empire's war strategy rarely involved massive invasions; more often it employed small scale methods such as attacking and destroying individual forts. The empire was among the first in India to use long range artillery commonly manned by foreign gunners (those from present day Turkmenistan were considered the best). Army troops were of two types: The king's personal army directly recruited by the empire and the feudal army under each feudatory. King Krishnadevaraya's personal army consisted of 100,000 infantry, 20,000 cavalrymen and over 900 elephants. This number was only a part of the army numbering over 1.1 million soldiers, a figure that varied as an army of two million has also been recorded along with the existence of a navy as evidenced by the use of the term Navigadaprabhu (commander of the navy). The army recruited from all classes of society (supported by the collection of additional feudal tributes from feudatory rulers), and consisted of archers and musketeers wearing quilted tunics, shieldmen with swords and poignards in their girdles, and soldiers carrying shields so large that no armour was necessary. The horses and elephants were fully armoured and the elephants had knives fastened to their tusks to do maximum damage in battle.The capital city was completely dependent on the water supply systems constructed to channel and store water, ensuring a consistent supply throughout the year. The remains of these hydraulic systems have given historians a picture of the prevailing surface water distribution methods in use at that time in the semiarid regions of South India. Contemporary records and notes of foreign travelers describe how huge tanks were constructed by labourers.

Steve Huey of AllMusic wrote that Thriller refined the strengths of Off the Wall; the dance and rock tracks were more aggressive, while the pop tunes and ballads were softer and more soulful. Its tracks included the ballads \\"The Lady in My Life\\", \\"Human Nature\\", and \\"The Girl Is Mine\\", the funk pieces \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\", and the disco set \\"Baby Be Mine\\" and \\"P.Y.T.

Article:","completion":"Title: The Smart Buyer's Guide: How to Purchase the Right Equipment Introduction Buying the right equipment can be a daunting task. With countless options available in the market, it's essential to do your research thoroughly and follow a systematic approach before making a significant investment. One of the critical aspects of purchasing equipment is to ensure its reliability, quality, and functionality. This article aims to guide you through the essential steps in assessing and testing equipment to make the right choice that benefits your business or personal needs. 1. Do Your Research and Ask Questions Before you even consider inspecting and testing the equipment, it's crucial to get acquainted with the specific requirements of your project or business needs. This will help you gauge the desired capacities and features you are looking for. Start asking the seller questions regarding the use, history, previous issues (if any), and reason for selling the equipment. This will not only build trust and transparency but also help you in understanding the reliability and performance of the equipment. 2. Thoroughly Test the Equipment Once your initial research is done, it's time to get hands-on with the equipment. Test out all its features and functionalities to make sure everything works as it should. Doing this not only ensures the optimal functioning of the equipment but also uncovers any potential issues that might be hidden beneath the surface. Here's a checklist to make sure you test every essential aspect of the equipment: - Switch on all the components and verify whether they work and respond as expected. - Test the equipment under different conditions and scenarios, like varying load capacity, temperature, and environmental factors based on your requirements. This will ensure that the equipment holds up well and is suitable for your specific needs. - For electronic or software-based equipment, thoroughly test the user interface, compatibility, error handling, and overall performance. Double-check if it is up-to-date and compatible with your existing systems, and if it isn't, discuss potential software upgrades with the seller. - If you're buying machinery or tools, carefully examine their movements, vibrations, noise levels, and any signs of wear and tear. 3. Inspect the Equipment Inside and Out After getting the equipment functioning as expected, the next crucial step is to carry out a thorough inspection.

We know that Mission Viejo Vigilantes was a minor league baseball team located in Mission Viejo, California. They played in the independent Western Baseball League and were not affiliated with any Major League Baseball team. Step 2: Research the Western Baseball League. We need to gather more information about the Western Baseball League to determine the number of teams in the league. Step 3: Compile the list of teams in the Western Baseball League. Once we have information on the Western Baseball League, we can compile a list of all the teams that played in the league, including the Mission Viejo Vigilantes.

As well as new buildings, the government wants more people to work in all the services in Beijing. There are a lot more people in the city, because of all the visitors to the Olympics. The city also need more places to eat and drink, because visitors eat out a lot. The government says the Beijing Olympics are \\"green\\", \\"hi-tech\\" , and \\"the People's Olympics\\". They want everyone to feel part of the Olympics. So the Chinese people have prepared for the Olympics too. Many people learn English to work as guides in 2008.

The first well-known mention was the compilation album \\"Anokha - Soundz of the Asian Underground\\" released in 1997 and masterminded by Talvin Singh and Sweety Kapoor. It is not a strict musical genre \\"per se\\", since the specific sounds can vary wildly (from Cornershop's Bollywood-influenced Britpop to Panjabi MCs' bhangra-influenced jungle). Most of these artists are the children or grandchildren of immigrants and have grown up in Western culture, but still have a strong Asian background through their families.

Ruben Navarrette Jr. is a nationally syndicated columnist and a member of the editorial board of the San Diego Union-Tribune. Read his column here Ruben Navarrette says Sarah Palin's critics challenged her because of prejudices about small-town values. SAN DIEGO, California (CNN) -- During the presidential election, some Democrats demanded to know how I could defend Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. Simply put, Palin is my people. She's small-town folk who wound up in the big leagues. Because I grew up in a small town with a population of less than 15,000 people, I was disgusted by the insults and condescension coming from those who think of themselves as the enlightened elite. Meanwhile, in small towns, I detected great affection for Palin. People talked about how she was \\"a real person\\" who \\"reflected their values.\\" The most significant divide in America isn't Red State vs. Blue State, it's rural vs. urban. The country mouse and the city mouse are still slugging it out. In 1982, New York Mayor Ed Koch ran unsuccessfully for governor of New York. Some say the deciding factor was when Koch described life in upstate New York as \\"sterile\\" and said he dreaded living in the \\"small town\\" of Albany, if elected. That didn't play well in rural areas. Now comes Colin Powell. During a recent appearance on CNN's \\"Fareed Zakaria GPS,\\" Powell attempted an autopsy on the Republican Party's failed presidential bid. He went after Palin, accusing her of pushing the party so far to the right that it went over a cliff. 1. Who is Ruben Navarrette Jr? 2. What does Ruben Navarrette say about Sarah? 3. How big is the population of the town? 4. How do they feel about Sarah Palin? 5. What is the most significant divide in America? 6. Who is Ed Koch? 7. Which year did he run for Mayor? 8.

The mayor of Reslie, while having a meeting about how to spend the excess funds from tourism this year, was told that the city is experiencing soil piping. The neighboring city, Tichago, consumes many of Reslie's grilled cheese sandwiches. The mayor of Tichago has just received a phone call from the mayor of Reslie asking if Tichago is also having soil piping. Tichago's mayor replies that no, they are not. Will Reslie need to replace their levees sooner or later than Tichago Hint: Soil piping is a particular form of soil erosion that occurs below the soil surface. It causes levee and dam failure, as well as sink hole formation. Turbulent flow removes soil starting at the mouth of the seep flow and the subsoil erosion advances up-gradient. The term sand boil is used to describe the appearance of the discharging end of an active soil pipe.Soil salination is the accumulation of free salts to such an extent that it leads to degradation of the agricultural value of soils and vegetation. Consequences include corrosion damage, reduced plant growth, erosion due to loss of plant cover and soil structure, and water quality problems due to sedimentation. Salination occurs due to a combination of natural and human-caused processes. Arid conditions favour salt accumulation. This is especially apparent when soil parent material is saline. Irrigation of arid lands is especially problematic. All irrigation water has some level of salinity. Irrigation, especially when it involves leakage from canals and overirrigation in the field, often raises the underlying water table. Rapid salination occurs when the land surface is within the capillary fringe of saline groundwater. Soil salinity control involves watertable control and flushing with higher levels of applied water in combination with tile drainage or another form of subsurface drainage. Answer:","completion":"Reslie will need to replace their levees sooner than Tichago due to the soil piping issue they are experiencing. Soil piping can cause levee and dam failure, making it necessary for Reslie to address the issue and replace the compromised levees before any potential disasters take place. Tichago, not experiencing soil piping, will not have the same urgent need to replace their levees."},{"prompt":"Q:- An organism dies - Water seeps into the remains - Minerals dissolved in the water form crystals - Crystalized minerals cause the remains to harden What might be the last step of the process?

I’ve shared my feelings about Temple Spa before in my review of Repose Aromatherapy Resting Cream. Basically, my first experience was a very pushy salesperson at a wedding fair several years ago which really put me off the brand, and it took me a while to try their products again. But when I did I was really impressed, and I can honestly say that nothing I’ve reviewed since has disappointed me! Today I’m reviewing Temple Spa Trufflesque, an Ultra Hydration & Radiance Masque for the face. Trufflesque aims to give hydration and radiance to the skin, and plumps to help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. It’s a luxury mask suitable for all skin types, particularly dry or dull skin, and it helps to rejuvenate tired skin too. The impressive list of ingredients includes black truffles, gold and silk peptides, but unfortunately these expensive additives contribute to Trufflesque’s slightly expensive price tag. The first thing that strikes me about this product is the amazing packaging. All Temple Spa products have really amazing, premium packaging, and I feel that they add to the feeling that you are about to use something really special on your skin. The dark glass jar has a gold lid and it is nestled in a gold and chocolate brown box with the most amazingly cute mask brush slotted in too. The mask itself is gold and it shimmers so prettily, if you look closely it’s almost as if you can see the particles of real gold! To apply you just paint the golden mask onto your face with the cute little brush (it makes applying the mask so easy) then leave for 15-20 minutes. The mask doesn’t dry completely, it stays a little bit tacky to the touch, and I find that it makes my skin tingle quite a bit. For extra benefits you can also then massage the mask into your skin for around 2 minutes, before removing with a damp muslin cloth or flannel.

Answer the following question: The answer to the question: What is the name of the band that played faster and more accurately on Kill 'Em All? is inside the article: Kill 'Em All features intricate riffing reminiscent of the NWOBHM bands played at high velocity. The album is considered crucial in the thrash metal genesis because it introduced fast percussion, low-register chords, and shredding leads to the genre. Hammett played some pentatonic patterns in addition to his breakneck solos. Ulrich adopted a double time snare pattern that would become a mainstay on Metallica's subsequent albums. Hetfield's vocals evolved from the melodic wail on No Life 'til Leather to a rough-edged bark, and the entire band played faster and more accurately on Kill 'Em All. Music writer Joel McIver said Burton's and Hetfield's performances were nearly virtuosic, because of the smooth-sounding bass of the former and the precise picking skills of the latter. According to journalist Chuck Eddy, the juvenile lyrical approach to topics such as warfare, violence and life on the road gives the album a \\"naive charm\\". The musical approach on Kill 'Em All was in contrast to the glam metal bands who dominated the charts in the early 1980s. Because of its rebellious nature and Metallica's street appearance, it appealed to fans who were not into the mainstream of hard rock. \\"Phantom Lord\\" is a lyrical nod to devilry. The song begins with synthesized bass drone and contains a middle section with clean, arpeggiated guitar chords. Written by Mustaine, its central riff is in NWOBHM fashion. \\"No Remorse\\" is a mid-tempo song which suddenly accelerates its tempo in the fifth minute. The song is about not feeling any remorse or sense of repentance during battle. \\"Seek & Destroy\\" was inspired by Diamond Head's \\"Dead Reckoning\\" and is the first song Metallica recorded during the Kill 'Em All sessions. Hetfield wrote the main riff in his truck outside a Los Angeles sticker factory where he was working. Because of its simple, one-line chorus, the song became a permanent setlist fixture and a crowd singalong. \\"Metal Militia\\", one of the fastest songs on the album, is about heavy metal's way of life and nonconformity...., can you guess it ? Answer:","completion":"The name of the band that played faster and more accurately on Kill 'Em All is Metallica."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Paris Whitney Hilton (born February 17, 1981) is an American television personality and business woman. She is the great-granddaughter of Conrad Hilton, the founder of Hilton Hotels. Born in New York City and raised there and in Beverly Hills, California, Hilton began her modeling career as a teenager when she signed with New York-based modeling development agency Trump Model Management. Her lifestyle and rumored short-lived relationships made her a feature of entertainment news and tabloid magazines, and Hilton was proclaimed \\"New York's leading It girl\\" in 2001. In January 2013, Hilton appeared in four episodes of the Danish version of Paradise Hotel, for which she was reportedly paid 300,000. She also appeared in two episodes of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, in which her aunts Kyle and Kim Richards play the leads. In April, Hilton opened the 44th Paris Hilton store in Bogota, Colombia. In May, the music video for Rich Gang's song \\"Tapout\\", in which Hilton appeared alongside Lil Wayne, Christina Milian and Nicki Minaj, premiered. That same month, it was reported that Hilton had signed with Cash Money Records and planned to release a second album sometime that year featuring collaborations with RedOne, Snoop Dogg and Flo Rida. She told Rolling Stone, \\"I'm working with so many talented and awesome people for my album and can't wait to share more of the music\\", describing the album as \\"very eclectic\\". The following month, Hilton made a cameo appearance in Sofia Coppola's film The Bling Ring, about the infamous group of teenagers who had robbed homes of celebrities such as Hilton, Lindsay Lohan and Orlando Bloom. In addition to appearing in the film, she loaned Coppola her house for two weeks of shooting. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Hilton said that Coppola liked her house when she went to a birthday party there. Recalling the house, Coppola said: \\"It was like we have to get this into the movie. It was so unique. It would be hard to recreate that. She is larger than life and her house is like Paris World.\\" During August, Hilton was a DJ at Amnesia's weekly \\"Foam and Diamonds\\" parties on Ibiza. The positive reaction from critics and audiences led to her contract's renewal for 2014. In October, Hilton released the first single from her upcoming second studio album, \\"Good Time\\" featuring rapper Lil Wayne. It debuted at number eighteen on the US Billboard Dance/Electronic Songs chart. The second single, \\"Come Alive\\", was released in July 2014. In April 2015, it was reported that Hilton's dog Tinkerbell, who appeared with her in The Simple Life, had died at the age of 14. In May, Hilton's third single from her upcoming second album, \\"High Off My Love\\", was released. It eventually peaked at number three on the Billboard US Dance Club Songs chart. In January 2016, Hilton's song \\"Crazy\\" in collaboration with DJ Poet surfaced online. She became engaged to model and actor Chris Zylka in January 2018. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Did she have any success with her music?","completion":"Yes, Paris Hilton did have success with her music.

For Christians, the wild celebrations of Mardi Gras come before the solemnity of Lent, a last chance to celebrate before the abstinence marking the 40 days to Good Friday and Easter. Muslims do it the other way around. First comes the month of daytime fasting during Ramadan, then the eruption of joy called Eid al-Fitr, marked with gift-giving, new clothes, donations to the poor, feasting and festivities. But as the sighting of a crescent moon officially marked the beginning of Eid on Tuesday, feelings are decidedly mixed for many Muslims. There's joy tempered with concern on Tahrir Square in Egypt, which saw a successful revolution topple President Hosni Mubarak this year. And there's optimism in Libya, where 42 years of rule by Moammar Gadhafi seem to be coming to an end. But emotions are much more muted in Syria, where the government is clamping down to prevent the Arab Spring from spreading, and there is a sense of gloom in Pakistan, wracked by violence and natural disasters. Egypt. Egyptians are putting a revolutionary twist on the traditional Eid greeting \\"Eid Mubarak,\\" meaning \\"a blessed Eid,\\" said engineering student Abdulrahman Khedr. \\"People are saying to each other 'Eid Mubarak without Mubarak,'\\" he said. Salma Hegab, an Egyptian student at the American University in Cairo, marked Eid in Tahrir Square, the symbolic center of the February revolution. \\"It was awesome seeing the Egyptian revolutionaries again with the same determination and enthusiasm,\\" she said. But she noticed with some concern that the long-suppressed Islamist group, the Muslim Brotherhood -- which has emerged as a major force -- was absent from the square. She was struck by a puppet show Brotherhood supporters performed for children in one neighborhood. It was \\"full of political implications,\\" she said. Traditionally, Eid prayers are a communal affair -- held in open fields to accommodate crowds too big to contain in mosques. But in the small village of Menofia, outside Cairo, the imam expressed concern the Muslim Brotherhood held its prayers separately, said Raghda Elkattan. The imam \\"mentioned that Islam should not be represented by the various views that started to take a political role in society,\\" said the medical student at Cairo University. \\"My father talked with the imam who said that he meant to give this kind of speech because he didn't like how the Islamic groups are so many and different.\\" Libya. Tripoli residents rang in the end of Ramadan with celebratory gunfire. It was \\"two times the celebration and two times the joy,\\" said medical student Khiria El-Feghi. \\"I remember celebrating Eid for the last couple of years in Libya,\\" she said. \\"People seemed to be happy that it was Eid, but I never saw this happiness deep in their eyes; I felt like there was a sadness deep down.\\" But this year was different, she said. While Libyans mourned those who died battling the regime of Moammar Gadhafi, a sense of hope permeated throughout. \\"When a nation wants something so badly, they will make sure that they get it; even if means lots of death,\\" she said. \\"Never underestimate the ability of a nation.\\" Syria. Celebrations were in short supply in Syria where pro-reform demonstrators took to the streets after Eid prayers and were met by brute force, opposition activists said. Security forces violently broke up rallies in Daraa, Damascus and Homs, activists said. \\"There will be no happiness while the martyrs' blood is still warm,\\" said the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, an activist group. In Daraa, a focal point in the nationwide wave of anti-government rage, Abu Abdu's three young children asked him, \\"Where are our new Eid clothes and sweets?\\" \\"Just pray to God,\\" he replied. \\"All we're going to do is visit the cemetery -- that's our Eid,\\" he said. Pakistan. Many residents of Pakistan said they are finding little to cheer about this holiday. In Karachi, where ongoing rivalries between three political parties vying for power have left dozens dead, Faisal Kapadia said Eid this year is a \\"hollow one.\\" \\"Never have I felt the apathy and sadness I feel now at the death of so many of my brothers and sisters in this last month,\\" said Kapadia, a writer and entrepreneur in Pakistan's largest city. Elsewhere in the country, rain-triggered flash floods have ruined crops and destroyed lives. \\"I know for a fact that this city and nation are amongst the most resilient on earth,\\" Kapadia said. \\"But even we cannot just keep getting up from blow after blow of this magnitude.\\" Zubaida Khan, a teacher in the capital, Islamabad, was envious of the protests sweeping throughout the Middle East. \\"We hate the rulers that have hijacked our country,\\" she said. \\"We would love to have regime change in Pakistan, just like in Libya and Egypt.\\" But she wasn't optimistic: \\"I don't think this Eid will bring about any positive change for Pakistan's future.\\" However, the Arab Spring revolts have left many Muslims with a distinct optimism about the future. That's a marked change from the decades when Arabs living under autocratic rulers would bitterly quote a verse by Iraqi-born poet Abu Tayeb Al-Mutanabbi asking if Eid will \\"be the same and even more sorrow, or will you be the sign of a new day?\\" For years, many Arabs assumed the answer was more sorrow. But this year, many are saying Arabs should be proud of what they have accomplished since the last Eid -- and they hold out hope for even more happiness by the next one. CNN's Saad Abedine, Reza Sayah and Yousuf Basil contributed to this report. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"Eid al-Fitr is a joyous occasion for Muslims, marking the end of the fasting month of Ramadan with gift-giving, new clothes, donations to the poor, feasting, and festivities. However, the emotions felt during this celebration can vary depending on the state of the country and the political, social, and environmental struggles taking place during that time. In Egypt, following the revolution that toppled President Hosni Mubarak, people put a revolutionary twist on the traditional Eid greeting \\"Eid Mubarak,\\" meaning \\"a blessed Eid.\\" There was a mix of joy and concern, particularly as emerging political forces led by the Muslim Brotherhood influenced the celebrations and their presence was felt in neighborhood events and prayer gatherings. In Libya, as the rule of Moammar Gadhafi neared its end, celebrations were marked with a sense of optimism and hope for a brighter future. Although there was mourning for those who lost their lives in the battle against Gadhafi's regime, the overall sentiment was one of triumph and anticipation for a new beginning. However, in Syria, emotion was much more subdued, with the government clamping down to prevent the Arab Spring from spreading. Anti-government protests were met with violence, leaving a somber atmosphere and many choosing to spend Eid visiting cemeteries to honor those who had fallen. In Pakistan, a sense of gloom pervaded the Eid celebrations amid ongoing political conflicts, violence, and natural disasters, such as flash floods. Many residents felt anger and frustration against the rulers in their country and desperately wished for change, inspired by the revolutions seen in Libya and Egypt. As political and social climates fluctuate, so too does the mood during the celebrations of Eid al-Fitr. While the core values and traditions of the holiday remain the same, the context in which it is celebrated is subject to change, making each year unique in terms of its emotional significance for Muslims."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

First, the Great Lakes are a group of five big lakes in North America. The water in these lakes comes from rain, snow, and melting ice.

In the quaint little town called Hamlet, nestled between the lush hills and colorful wildflower meadows, every creature was exceptional in its own way. The bees gossiped about the juiciest flowers. The foxes loved to read books in their dens by the moonlight. The goats could even carry out simple arithmetic. However, the most curious creatures in the town of Hamlet were the hamsters. The hamsters of Hamlet were anything but ordinary. They were blessed with an intelligence that rivaled even the cleverest of human scholars, and their extraordinary hearing abilities allowed them to perceive even the faintest whispers from miles away. With such refined ears, it was believed that these extraordinary hamsters were destined to unravel the secrets of the universe. Because of their unique hearing abilities, the hamsters were constantly studying and learning. Each day, they explored every nook and cranny of their surroundings, sharing stories and theories about faraway lands, the stars, and even the finest details of their beautiful town. One day, a newcomer arrived in Hamlet. This newcomer was Dr. Fluffenstein, a kind and brilliant hedgehog who was known far and wide for his revolutionary invention — the cotton bud. People came from all over to have their ears cleaned by the talented Dr. Fluffenstein, who always made extra sure to carefully remove every single particle of dirt from their ears. One sunny morning, Dr. Fluffenstein decided to visit the extraordinary hamsters of Hamlet. Hearing about their unique and unmatched hearing abilities, he was eager to learn more about their ears. As he approached the hamsters' burrow, he encountered Sir Snifflesmith, a distinguished hamster with a bushy white moustache and a sophisticated monocle. Intrigued by Dr. Fluffenstein's cotton buds, Sir Snifflesmith invited him into their library to discuss his innovative findings. But as soon as Dr. Fluffenstein attempted to demonstrate the use of his cotton bud on one of Sir Snifflesmith's delicate ears, he realized the cotton bud would not fit. He realized the ear of the hamster was much narrower than he had anticipated. Sir Snifflesmith looked at Dr. Fluffenstein with concern in his tiny eyes, worried that his hearing would never be the same. Dr. Fluffenstein, however, was not the type to give up so easily. He decided to embark upon an ambitious project: to redesign and refine his cotton buds specifically for the hamsters of Hamlet. He collaborated with Sir Snifflesmith and the hamsters, using their knowledge to create improved cotton buds to accommodate their narrow ears. Together, they spent countless hours experimenting with various materials and shapes to craft the perfect cotton buds. After many months of research, hard work, and dedication, Dr. Fluffenstein and the hamsters successfully created the desired cotton buds. These new cotton buds, called \\"Hamster Whisperers,\\" were smaller and narrower, with a sophisticated design that allowed them to fit snugly into the hamsters' narrow ears without causing any discomfort. The Hamster Whisperers quickly became a sought-after item in the town of Hamlet. Each hamster reveled in the newfound cleanliness of their ears, and their hearing became even more acute. Hamsters began to pick up secrets from the stars and learned to communicate with creatures from faraway lands, broadening their understanding of the world beyond their cozy town. Eventually, news of the Hamster Whisperers spread beyond Hamlet, and soon hamsters from all around the world arrived to experience the incredible cleaning power of Dr. Fluffenstein's new creation. Working side by side, Dr. Fluffenstein and the hamsters played a vital role in ensuring the wellbeing of their fellow creatures by perfecting the Hamster Whisperers. And thus, with the combined efforts of Dr. Fluffenstein and the extraordinary hamsters of Hamlet, the world came to understand and embrace the importance of clean ears."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It is typically heard in wealthy white families who trace their families back generations in the city. It has ingliding or monophthongal long mid-vowels, raises ay and aw in certain environments, and is nonrhotic. Sylvester Primer of the College of Charleston wrote about aspects of the local dialect in his late 19th-century works: \\"Charleston Provincialisms\\" (1887) and \\"The Huguenot Element in Charleston's Provincialisms\\", published in a German journal. He believed the accent was based on the English as it was spoken by the earliest settlers, therefore derived from Elizabethan England and preserved with modifications by Charleston speakers. The rapidly disappearing \\"Charleston accent\\" is still noted in the local pronunciation of the city's name. Some elderly (and usually upper-class) Charleston natives ignore the 'r' and elongate the first vowel, pronouncing the name as \\"Chah-l-ston\\". Some observers attribute these unique features of Charleston's speech to its early settlement by French Huguenots and Sephardic Jews (who were primarily English speakers from London), both of whom played influential roles in Charleston's early development and history.[citation needed] To which college did Sylvester Primer belong?","completion":"Sylvester Primer belonged to the College of Charleston."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Information: - Somalia ( '), officially the Federal Republic of Somalia , is a country located in the Horn of Africa. It is bordered by Ethiopia to the west, Djibouti to the northwest, the Gulf of Aden to the north, the Indian Ocean to the east, and Kenya to the southwest. Somalia has the longest coastline on Africa's mainland, and its terrain consists mainly of plateaus, plains and highlands. Climatically, hot conditions prevail year-round, with periodic monsoon winds and irregular rainfall. - Aden (, ; \\"\\" ) is a port city in Yemen, located by the eastern approach to the Red Sea (the Gulf of Aden), some east of Bab-el-Mandeb. Its population is approximately 800,000 people. Aden's ancient, natural harbour lies in the crater of a dormant volcano which now forms a peninsula, joined to the mainland by a low isthmus. This harbour, Front Bay, was first used by the ancient Kingdom of Awsan between the 5th and 7th centuries BC. The modern harbour is on the other side of the peninsula. Aden gives its name to the Gulf of Aden. - Swayne 's hartebeest ( Alcelaphus buselaphus swaynei ) is an endangered antelope native to Ethiopia . Two of the largest remaining populations are located in Senkelle Swayne 's Hartebeest Sanctuary and Maze National Park . It has been extirpated from Somalia . It is named after British officer H. G. C. Swayne ( 1860 -- 1940 ) . - Bison are large, even-toed ungulates in the genus \\"Bison\\" within the subfamily Bovinae. - A country is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography. A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction. - The even-toed ungulates (order Artiodactyla) are ungulates (hoofed animals) whose weight is borne equally by the third and fourth toes. By contrast, odd-toed ungulates, such as horses, bear their weight primarily on their third toe. The aquatic Cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) evolved from even-toed ungulate ancestors, and therefore modern taxonomic classification combines Artiodactyla and Cetacea into Cetartiodactyla. - Ethiopia ('), officially known as the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia\\"' ( , \\"yetiyoya Fdralaw Dmokirasyaw Rpebilk\\" ), is a country located in the Horn of Africa. It shares borders with Eritrea to the north and northeast, Djibouti and Somalia to the east, Sudan and South Sudan to the west, and Kenya to the south. With nearly 100 million inhabitants, Ethiopia is the most populous landlocked country in the world, as well as the second-most populous nation on the African continent after Nigeria. It occupies a total area of , and its capital and largest city is Addis Ababa. - Eurasia is the combined continental landmass of Europe and Asia. The term is a portmanteau of its constituent continents. Located primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, with no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on the paleomagnet data. - The domestic goat (\\"Capra aegagrus hircus\\") is a subspecies of goat domesticated from the wild goat of southwest Asia and Eastern Europe. - An antelope is a member of a number of even-toed ungulate species indigenous to various regions in Africa and Eurasia. Antelopes comprise a wastebasket taxon (miscellaneous group) within the family Bovidae, encompassing those Old World species that are not cattle, sheep, buffalo, bison, or goats. A group of antelope is called a herd. - The sheep (\\"Ovis aries\\") is a quadrupedal, ruminant mammal typically kept as livestock. Like all ruminants, sheep are members of the order Artiodactyla, the even-toed ungulates. Although the name \\"sheep\\" applies to many species in the genus \\"Ovis\\", in everyday usage it almost always refers to \\"Ovis aries\\". Numbering a little over one billion, domestic sheep are also the most numerous species of sheep. An adult female sheep is referred to as a \\"ewe\\", an intact male as a \\"ram\\" or occasionally a \\"tup\\", a castrated male as a \\"wether\\", and a younger sheep as a \\"lamb\\". - A herd is a social grouping of certain animals of the same species, either wild or domestic. The form of collective animal behavior associated with this is referred to as \\"herding\\". What is the relationship between 'swayne's hartebeest' and 'subspecies'? The answer is:","completion":"Swayne's hartebeest is a subspecies of the hartebeest (Alcelaphus buselaphus), an antelope native to Africa.

Went to see the movie with great anticipation - of course not once did I imagine it would be anywhere near the original. I knew it wouldn't, the promos said it all. But even then I thought it would be a great RGV treat, after all isn't he the same guy who directed Sathya and Company? Or is he? I have my doubts after watching Aag. I am not going to talk about the plot or the story, as most of it is taken from the original, if you are really dying to go and see this one, you could play a fun game with friends: identify the scenes from the original one and give ratings of your own! So Veeru becomes Heero (how corny is that?), guess Heeru wouldn't sound that great. Ajay Devgan is quite a disaster as Heero, the comedy is strained and the slurred talk that really was effective in Company sounds fake. The chemistry between Heero and Gunghroo (Nisha Kothari) doesn't exists at all. In fact the more charming Nisha tries to be the more irritating she becomes. This reaches a peak by the end. Raj is in fact not bad as compared to the others, he is a guy to watch in the future. I was really disappointed with Amitabh Bachchan as Babban, he looks like a caricature of Gabbar Singh.

Article:","completion":"Title: Making the Most of Your Public Transportation Experience: A Step-by-Step Guide Introduction: Public transportation is an essential and often cost-effective way to travel in many cities around the world. It allows you to navigate through busy urban areas, reach your destination quickly, and reduce your carbon footprint. To ensure a seamless and enjoyable journey, it's essential to plan ahead and follow some key steps. In this article, we'll guide you through the process of using public transportation, from planning your trip to enjoying the ride. Step 1: Plan Your Trip Before setting out on your journey, it's crucial to plan your trip. Familiarize yourself with the transportation options available in the city you're in, such as buses, subways, trams, or trains. Be sure to check the schedules and routes, so you can determine the best way to reach your destination. Using a transportation app or the official website can help you get accurate information on arrival and departure times, as well as any potential delays or service interruptions. Step 2: Enter the Station and Pay the Fare Once you've decided on the best mode of transportation, head to the station or stop where your choice begins. Take note of the fare or ticket prices, which can be found at the entrance or on the transit authority's website. Remember to bring enough cash or a payment card to cover the cost. Some stations may have automated ticketing machines or a staffed ticket booth where you can purchase your fare. Step 3: Consider Buying a Pass If you're planning to use public transportation frequently during your stay or commute, consider purchasing a pass. Passes enable you to travel unlimited within a certain period, such as a day, week, or month, and can save you money compared to paying for individual rides. Additionally, passes can help you save time by skipping the process of purchasing fares for each trip. Be sure to research the different types of passes available to find the best option for your needs. Step 4: Make Your Way to the Boarding Area After paying for your fare, proceed to the boarding area for your chosen mode of transportation. There are often signs, maps, or other indicators to help you find your way. Always remember to stand behind the designated safety line on platforms to avoid accidents. Also, be aware of your surroundings and respect fellow passengers' personal space. Step 5: Get on Board When your vehicle arrives, wait for passengers to exit before boarding. Once on board, find a seat or secure a place to hold onto if standing. Make sure to keep your belongings close to you and avoid blocking aisles or doors. Familiarize yourself with the route and stops to ensure you disembark at the correct location. Step 6: Enjoy the Ride! As you travel, remember that public transportation is an opportunity to relax, observe your surroundings, or even strike up a conversation with fellow passengers. Make the most of your journey by embracing the experience and arriving at your destination with a positive mindset. Conclusion: Public transportation is an efficient and environmentally friendly way to navigate the bustling city streets. By following these six steps—planning your trip, entering the station, paying your fare, considering a pass, boarding, and enjoying the ride—you'll be well on your way to a successful and enjoyable public transportation experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Assume good rapport at this point. Make the customer feel like an insider. Phrases like \\"we hope to do business with you again soon\\" sound like tag lines; best to leave these out. Don't say something you wouldn't say to an acquaintance. Don't include a product pitch, a mention of an upcoming sale, or anything else that could be construed as an ad.

In fact, it may mean your thank-you note will end up in the junk mail pile. Again, the more personalized you make the thank-you note, the better it will be received. If you don't have time to address envelopes, have someone else do it. Even if you're not the person actually writing out the address, the customer will be impressed to see handwriting.

This week Jim skipped his warm up before exercising, because he was a bit late. Tom warmed up properly before running. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which runner didn't have an increased heart rate? Hint: Sometimes muscles and tendons get injured when a person starts doing an activity before they have warmed up properly. A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate. Even elite athletes need to warm up ( Figure below ). The answer to this question is:","completion":"Based on the information provided, both Tom and Jim would have an increased heart rate after running.

The result was a second consecutive victory for Constantine Karamanlis and his National Radical Union party , which won 171 of the 300 seats in Parliament . - Athens (\\"Athína\\" ) is the capital and largest city of Greece. Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study. - The National Radical Union ((), \\"Ethnik Rizospastik Énsis\\" (ERE)) was a Greek political party formed in 1955 by Konstantinos Karamanlis, mostly out of the Greek Rally party. - Greece (' ), officially the Hellenic Republic (Greek: ' ), historically also known as Hellas (\\"\\" ), is a country in southeastern Europe. Greece's population is approximately 10.955 million as of 2015. Athens is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by Thessaloniki. - Greek Rally ((), \\"Ellnikòs Synagermós (ES)\\") was a right-wing political party in Greece. Founded on 6 August 1951 by former field marshal Alexandros Papagos, the party encompassed a broad spectrum of the royalist conservative elements in Greek society and was modelled on the Charles de Gaulle's Rassemblement du Peuple Français (RPF). Throughout the years, the Greek right had become splintered. Papagos' new party managed to attract considerable support, and the Populist Uniting Party (led by Panagiotis Kanellopoulos and Stephanos Stephanopoulos) and the New Party (led by Spiros Markezinis) dissolved and merged with the Greek Rally. Later on, a large portion of the People's Party, the major right-wing party of the prewar era, defected to the Greek Rally; among the prominent defectors was Konstantinos Karamanlis.

Article: People fell in love with Elizabeth Taylor in 1944, when she starred inNational Velvet-the story of Velvet Brown, a young girl who wins first place in a famous horse race, At first, the producers of the movie told Taylor that she was too small to play the part of Velvet. However, they waited for her for a few months as she exercised and trained--and added three inches to her height in four months! Her acting inNational Velvetis still considered the best by a child actress. Elizabeth Taylor was born in London in 1932. Her parents, both Americans, had moved there for business reasons. When World War II started, the Taylor moved to Beverly Hills, California, and there Elizabeth started acting in movies. After her success as a child star, Taylor had no trouble moving into adult roles and won twice for Best Actress:Butterfield8 (1960) andWho's Afraid of Virginia Woolf ? (1966) Taylor's fame and popularity gave her a lot of power with the movie industry, so she was able to demand very high pay for her movies. In 1963, she received 1 million for her part inCleopatra--the highest pay received by any star up to that time. Elizabeth Taylor is a legend of our time. Like Velvet Brown inNational Velvet, she has been lucky, she has beauty, fame and wealth. But she is also a hard worker. Taylor seldom acts in movies any more. Instead, she puts her time and efforts into her businesses, and into helping others--several years ago, she founded an organization that has raised more than 40 million for research and education.

Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context?

It is an alternative to the extraterrestrial hypothesis (ETH). Hypothesis: Jacques Vallée does not believe in UFOs.","completion":"Looking at the task, I have been given a context and a hypothesis. I need to examine if the hypothesis (\\"Jacques Vallée does not believe in UFOs\\") is supported by the context provided. Here's my step-by-step thinking process: Step 1: I examine the hypothesis - it claims Jacques Vallée doesn't believe in UFOs. Step 2: Now I will examine the context - it mentions that Jacques Vallée is a ufologist, which implies that he indeed studies UFOs. It describes the interdimensional hypothesis advanced by Vallée, suggesting UFOs and related events involve visitations from other \\"realities\\" or \\"dimensions\\" coexisting separately alongside our own. This shows that he has formed theories about UFOs. Step 3: I match the hypothesis to the context - The fact that Vallée has developed a theory about UFOs contradicts the hypothesis that he doesn't believe in UFOs.

I don't know if I'd consider it a masterpiece of not, but it's damn near close; it's extremely well made, artistic, suspenseful, intricately plotted, thematically challenging and full of bleak foreshadowing and sexual-religious imagery. There's also some great camera-work from Jan de Bont, an atmospheric score from Loek Dikker and outstanding acting from Jeroen Krabbé and Renée Soutendijk, the latter giving one of the most sneaky, subtle 'femme fatale' performance I've ever seen. Like many other European movies, this movie has an unashamed, non-judgmental attitude toward sex, nudity and the complexities of sexuality and has zero reservations about mixing it all up with religious and/or surrealistic (some would say blasphemous) images. In other words, if you can't bear the thought of seeing a lust-driven homosexual envisioning the object of his carnal desire as Jesus crucified on the cross before the two of them go at it inside a cemetery crypt then this might not be the movie for you. What surprised me more is how this bizarre movie managed to completely dodge being a pretentious mess. It mixes the abstract/surreal/parallel fantasy-reality scenes and somehow makes it all work. Like any good mystery, you can see the pieces slowly falling into place as the movie progresses. There is NOT an out-of-left-field resolution here. The movie has direction, there's no needless filler and once it concludes, you begin to understand the purpose of what may have confused you earlier. If you like the work of Ken Russell and David Lynch, I can almost guarantee you will love this movie. Hell, if you have no idea who they even are, you still might like it. I'm not going to spoil the plot by getting too detailed, but the film's opening shot - through a web as a spider catches its prey - sets the stage as Krabbé, as unshaven, smug, bisexual writer Gerard Reve (interestingly, also the name of the writer whose novel this is based on) crosses paths with a wealthy, mysterious, sexy woman named Christine (Soutendijk, melding androgynous stylings with Simone Simon-like innocence/cuteness that's pretty unnerving), who may be a literal 'black widow' responsible for the deaths of her three previous husbands. The two become lovers and move in with one another, but we're led to believe (through Christine's bizarre behavior and the frequent appearances of another woman - played by Geert de Jong - who may or may not actually exist) something terrible is boiling under the surface. When another of Christine's lovers, the young and \\"beautiful\\" Herman (Thom Hoffman), shows up at the house, things take an unexpected turn. And that's all you need to know. THE 4TH MAN was a huge art-house success in much of the world, but didn't make it over to the US until 1984, where it was awarded the Best Foreign Film of the year from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association. The most common video is the Media release, which has been horribly dubbed. Try to avoid that one and head straight for the newer subtitled Anchor Bay DVD release. Since coming to America, Verhoeven's career has had its ups and downs. He has made a few decent films (Flesh & Blood, RoboCop) and some lousy ones (Showgirls). In fact, Verhoeven's big hit Basic Instinct is almost like a less interesting, junior league version of The Fourth Man. Soutendjik also tried her hand at acting in America and since GRAVE SECRETS (1989) and EVE OF DESTRUCTION (1991) were the best offers she was getting, she headed right back home to the Netherlands.

Article: Japanese sailor Kenichi Horie has finished a 110-day solo voyage across the Pacific Ocean in a boat pushed by sea waves to win another world first. Weak waves and ocean water movements made his arrival late, which was going to be in late May. \\"When waves were weak, the boat slowed down. That's a problem that needs to be solved,\\" the adventure told reporters from his boat in western Japan. His 9.5-meter-long boat can move like a dolphin's tail, and it rises or falls with the waves. Horie reached his destination in the channel between the main Japanese islands just before midnight after covering about 7,000 kilometers from Hawaii. Horie first made world record in 1962 when, at the age of 23, he became the first person to sail alone across the Pacific. He made the three-month voyage from his hometown in spite of breaking Japanese law, which did not allow his citizens to sail on their own out of the country, and without a passport or money. He was arrested upon arrival in San Francisco but the city mayor freed him, gave him a 30-day visa and made him an honorary citizen. News of his achievement made him a hero back home in Japan and his book of the voyage In the Pacific was made into a film. Since then, he has completed many sailing trips across the Pacific and around the world. After his latest adventure with an environmentally friendly theme, Horie planned to return to his hometown on Sunday. He said, \\"Throughout history, mankind has used wind for power, but no one has appeared to be serious about wave power.\\" Horie told the reporter, \\"I think I'm a lucky boy as this wave power system has remained untouched in fact.\\" Question: Which of the following statements best proves that Horie's latest voyage was meaningful?

Free Speech Issues Still Problematic For Vietnam JAKARTA, Indonesia A business manager in Hanoi, Pham Hong Son, has spent 42 months in a Vietnamese prison. His crime: downloading an essay titled \\"What is Democracy?\\" from a U.S. State Department Web site, translating it and sending it to friends and senior Communist Party officials. Son, 36, who worked for a pharmaceutical company, was convicted of espionage in Vietnam after a closed, one-day trial in June 2003. He was sentenced to 13 years, later reduced to five. \\"What he did was legal,\\" insisted his wife, Vu Thuy Ha, 34, in a June interview in Hanoi. She said that her husband was exercising free speech and did not commit a seditious act. \\"What can anyone do with the translation? What can they do to overthrow the government?\\" Last week, the U.S. ambassador to Vietnam, Michael Marine, called on Vietnam to release Son and four others described as prisoners of conscience. Vietnam has made progress in \\"collective\\" human rights such as improving education and reducing poverty, Marine noted. But it is still intolerant of political dissent, he said. \\"History has shown that political and religious freedoms go hand in hand with economic prosperity,\\" Marine said in a speech to the American Chamber of Commerce in Hanoi. \\"The pace and scope of Vietnam's future success depends on a strong commitment to reform in both of these areas.\\" Political analysts and international human rights groups do not know precisely how many prisoners of conscience Vietnam has detained, but U.S. officials said the number of cases they have been able to verify had dwindled in recent years to 10 or fewer. During the past year, Vietnam has released more than 26,000 prisoners, of whom perhaps 15 were political or religious prisoners, U.S. officials said. The younger ones in particular, such as Son and Nguyen Vu Binh, who was accused of posting \\"reactionary\\" articles on the Internet and of trying to set up a liberal democratic party, remain incarcerated. The government insists it is not repressing religious or political rights. \\"Some people may argue that Vietnam does not have freedom and democracy and only has a one-party system. But you know, our ultimate goal is to maintain political stability and serve the interests of the people,\\" Prime Minister Phan Van Khai said in a June interview. \\"We do not agree with arguments from the outside that there are prisoners of conscience in Vietnam. We do not have any prisoners of conscience in Vietnam.\\" Vietnam last month issued a human rights report in which it promised to respect freedom of expression and promote free use of the Internet. A revised press law in 1999 stated that citizens have the right to be informed, express opinions and provide information without being censored by any organization or individual, it noted. Nonetheless, the United States last year placed Vietnam on a list of \\"countries of particular concern\\" with regard to religious freedom. Officials expect Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to decide soon whether Vietnam should remain on the list. Marine said that although Vietnam has taken steps to expand religious and political space, \\"there is more, much more, that the authorities can and should do.\\" Pham Hong Son was part of a loose group of young men, including his friend Nguyen Vu Binh, who believed in expanded individual political freedoms. Their circle was not large enough to constitute a movement, according to interviews with several older dissidents. They rarely met in groups because to do so would invite government scrutiny. The older dissidents said they warned the younger men to keep a low profile. Son, for instance, once thought of setting up a democracy fund, said Hoang Minh Chinh, 86, who over the decades has been imprisoned three times by the government for a total of 20 years.

Marine asserts that embracing political and religious freedoms is essential for Vietnam's economic prosperity.

Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","completion":"Yes, these two sentences are paraphrases of each other. Both sentences convey the same meaning but use slightly different wording. The essential message in both sentences is that the outlaws have made a conscious decision to rely on the poor class of people for their livelihood rather than targeting the wealthy or the rich. In the first sentence, the term \\"wealthy\\" is employed to describe the people who possess a considerable amount of money, property, or valuable possessions.

Although the words may differ, they essentially refer to the same socio-economic group of people who hold significant financial resources. Furthermore, both sentences emphasize that the outlaws' targets are the \\"poor class\\" of people, which indicates the economically disadvantaged or those who are struggling financially. In conclusion, the two sentences are paraphrases of each other since they express the same idea by substituting a few words, but the overall message remains the same.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? To dust a large piece of furniture.","completion":"Dusting a large piece of furniture can seem like an overwhelming task, but it can be easily accomplished by following a systematic approach. Here's a detailed and step-by-step guide to help you dust a large piece of furniture effectively: 1. Gather the necessary supplies: Before you begin, make sure you have all the essential tools and supplies needed for the task. These include: a. A microfiber cloth or a soft duster: Microfiber cloths are ideal for capturing dust without scratching the furniture's surface, while a soft duster can effectively remove loose dust. b. Furniture polish or cleaner: Choose a polish or cleaner that is suitable for the material of your furniture, whether it is wood, metal or another material. c. A vacuum cleaner with brush attachment: This can be useful for removing dust from hard-to-reach areas and crevices. d. A step stool or ladder, if necessary: Large pieces of furniture may require a bit of extra reach, so it's important to have a sturdy step stool or ladder to ensure your safety during the cleaning process. 2. Clear the area: Remove all objects, decorations and, if possible, any cushions, pillows or upholstery from the furniture. This will make it more accessible and ensure that you do not miss any spots. 3. Vacuum the surrounding floor area: Start by vacuuming the area around the furniture to remove any loose dust and dirt, which may otherwise end up back onto the furniture later on. 4. Start from the top: Always start dusting from the top of the furniture and work your way down. This ensures that you don't knock dust off a higher surface onto a lower one while cleaning. 5. Dust all surfaces: Use the microfiber cloth or soft duster to gently wipe all surfaces of the furniture, including the top, sides, legs and any decorative elements. Be careful not to apply too much pressure, as it can cause scratches or other damage. 6. Reach into crevices and corners: Use the vacuum cleaner with a brush attachment to reach into tight spots and crevices, such as between shelves, behind decorative elements, inside drawers, or around handles and knobs. 7. Apply furniture polish or cleaner: Following the manufacturer's instructions, apply the appropriate furniture polish or cleaner evenly across the surface of the furniture, making sure not to leave any residue behind. This step is essential for maintaining the long-term beauty and integrity of your furniture. 8. Buff and polish: To finish, use a clean, dry microfiber cloth to buff and polish the furniture, working in the direction of the wood grain or surface pattern. This will leave the surface looking shiny and new. 9. Replace objects and decorations: Once you're done dusting and polishing your large piece of furniture, carefully return all objects and decorations to their original positions. If necessary, give these items a quick dusting as well before placing them back on the furniture. 10. Regular upkeep: To maintain the cleanliness of your large piece of furniture, follow this process every few weeks or as needed, based on the amount of dust buildup in your environment. By following these steps, you can efficiently and effectively remove dust and dirt particles from a large piece of furniture, leaving it clean, shiny, and ready for continued use."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? A denim vest is typically worn during hotter months to spice up summer outfits. Add it to your own favorite summertime outfits to make your look more interesting and give yourself a fashionable edge. It’s also seen as more on the casual side due to its association with jeans, so don’t try to pull it off in more elegant situations unless you’re extremely confident it works. While it’s possible to wear a denim vest during colder seasons, the lack of bulk and cloth make the item of clothing little more than a fashion accessory. Save your denim vest for spring, summer and early fall. Pair your denim vest with existing items in your wardrobe. A vest is usually paired with sundresses, shorts, a floor-length skirt, and loose fitting pants. If it’s spring or fall, you can also pair a denim vest with an all-black outfit to give it a pop of color Denim vests are best paired with black outfits, crop-tops, colorful pants, and stripes to both spice up and neutralize worn colors. Wearing denim vests with other denim is doable, but requires the two items of clothing to be of two obviously different washes. After you’ve properly sported your denim vest, know how to properly keep it clean. Denim is a very strong material – originally invented to withstand a blue-collar workday – but is very sensitive to washing. Washing too much can cause your denim to lose its color. Spot-clean your denim vest with a toothbrush and a minimal amount of laundry detergent. This will only clean the vest on a need-to-clean basis and save it from the wear and tear of a normal washing machine. Soak your vest in vinegar and water. Water itself will cause the vest to lose its color. Vinegar helps conserve the color. Soak the vest for about an hour before hanging it up to dry. The same technique can be used with a washing machine by washing your vest on the hand-wash setting and adding vinegar over laundry detergent. Summary:","completion":"A denim vest is a versatile fashion item for warmer months, often paired with sundresses, shorts, skirts, or loose pants; it can be carefully washed using spot-cleaning or vinegar to maintain its color, and is best saved for casual settings."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Background: Gasoline-powered vehicles emit a lot of harmful materials. Nitrogen oxides are formed when atmospheric nitrogen reacts with oxygen at the high temperatures found in a car engine. Carbon monoxide is a by-product of incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. Evaporated and unused fuel releases volatile hydrocarbons into the atmosphere to help form smog. The presence of a catalytic converter in the exhaust system of the car causes these materials to react and be changed into less harmful products. Paragraph: After decades of debate, Brunei decided to adopt electrical vehicles and use them extensively, ultimately phasing out gasoline powered vehicles. Their neighbor Nepal decided to continue using gasoline-powered vehicles extensively. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which country experienced fewer volatile hydrocarbons in the atmosphere? A:","completion":"Brunei Brunei experienced fewer volatile hydrocarbons in the atmosphere due to their decision to adopt electric vehicles (EVs) and phase out gasoline-powered vehicles. In contrast, Nepal continued to use gasoline-powered vehicles extensively. Let's explore the reasoning behind this answer. Gasoline-powered vehicles emit a variety of harmful materials, including nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and volatile hydrocarbons. These emissions are the result of the combustion process occurring within the engine, where fuel is burned to generate energy. When gasoline-powered vehicles are used extensively, the harmful materials released into the environment contribute to air pollution, smog, and various health issues. On the other hand, electric vehicles are powered by batteries and produce little to no tailpipe emissions. As a result, they emit significantly fewer harmful materials into the environment, contributing to cleaner air and reduced pollution. By adopting electric vehicles as their primary mode of transportation, Brunei took a significant step towards reducing the levels of harmful emissions, including volatile hydrocarbons, in their atmosphere. It is essential to note that not all electric vehicle production and energy generation used for charging are entirely eco-friendly. However, the typical EV running emission levels are still considerably lower than those of gasoline-powered vehicles. Brunei's decision to adopt electric vehicles extensively indicates their intention to reduce their environmental impact and ultimately led to less harmful emissions compared to Nepal's continuing reliance on gasoline-powered vehicles. Based on the information provided in the paragraph, given the choice between Brunei and Nepal, it is clear that Brunei experienced fewer volatile hydrocarbons in the atmosphere due to their decision to adopt electric vehicles and phase out gasoline-powered cars."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: What is the final step of the following process: - Water in the clouds becomes very cold - The cold water forms ice crystals - The ice crystals grow by absorbing surrounding water droplets - Form snowflakes The answer is:","completion":"The final step of the mentioned process after the formation of snowflakes is the eventual falling of these snowflakes as snowfall. In more detail, when water in the clouds becomes exceedingly cold, usually below the freezing point of water (0 degrees Celsius or 32 degrees Fahrenheit), it turns into ice crystals. These ice crystals begin to grow in size and complexity as they absorb surrounding water droplets. Gradually, they merge with other ice crystals to take the shape of snowflakes, each of which has its own unique structure. The snowflakes become heavier as they grow, and their structural complexity increases, leading to an increase in their surface area, which slows down their descent. Due to their increased weight, the updrafts and air currents within the cloud can no longer hold them aloft, and they start to fall towards the Earth's surface. As the snowflakes descend through the atmosphere, they may encounter variations in temperature, humidity, and wind speed, which can influence their shape and size. Snow can fall individually, as single snowflakes, or clump together and become aggregate snowflakes. When the snowflakes reach the ground, they accumulate and form a layer of snow, which could be a light dusting or a thicker blanket, depending on the amount and intensity of the snowfall. The accumulation of snow can lead to various environmental and societal impacts. For instance, it can change the landscape and provide vital water resources for ecosystems and human consumption. Snow is also the basis for numerous winter recreational activities such as skiing, snowboarding, sledding, and snowshoeing.

The vehicle will come in two configurations, with the biggest standing more than 95m (313ft) tall. Mr Bezos aims for a first launch before the end of the decade. Blue Origin has shown impressive progress recently on its much smaller, sub orbital-rocket and capsule system known as New Shepard. This has flown five times over the Texas desert, with the booster returning to Earth safely on the last four occasions. But Mr Bezos has always spoken of his desire to build a much more capable vehicle - and the New Glenn is it. Named after the first American to orbit the planet - John Glenn - the 7m-wide (23ft) rocket will be powered at its base by seven engines burning liquid methane and liquid oxygen. This is envisaged to produce a thrust of 17.1 megaNewtons (3.85 million pounds force) at lift-off. By way of comparison, Europe's Ariane 5 rocket produces 13 megaNewtons from its main liquid-fuelled core-stage engine and two sold-fuelled solid motors. As with the New Shepard booster, the New Glenn's main stage would come back to Earth to make a controlled landing after its mission. The New Glenn's first stage would be topped with a second stage, and, if needed, by a third stage. The first additional segment would be powered by a single methane engine. The second additional segment (third stage) would use one engine burning liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen - the same engine as powers the New Shepard now. The full configuration would be required to send payloads beyond low-Earth orbit. A year ago Mr Bezos announced that he was leasing the historic Launch Complex 36 at Cape Canaveral, which was used by the rockets that despatched some of the first inter-planetary probes. Manufacturing facilities were also to be set up in the area. In a statement on Monday, the Amazon boss said: \\"Our vision is millions of people living and working in space, and New Glenn is a very important step.\\" And then, tantalisingly, he added: \\"It won't be the last of course. Up next on our drawing board: New Armstrong. But that's a story for the future.\\" The entrepreneur is gradually ramping up his space activities. The same methane engine, the BE-4, to be used on the New Glenn is currently in competition to power another rocket operated by the Boeing and Lockheed Martin joint venture - United Launch Alliance. This rocket, to be called the Vulcan, would be the successor to the vehicles that are presently used by Nasa and the US Air Force to launch most of America's science and national security missions. Blue Origin continues work on its New Shepard system, which is expected to be used in due course for tourist flights and for micro-gravity experiments. The next launch is scheduled in a few weeks, when an emergency abort will be practised. This procedure will see the capsule separated from its booster early in the flight to simulate a problem. It is the type of test engineers carry out to prove a spacecraft is safe to carry people.

We do not know exactly how the hijackers gained access to the cockpit; FAA rules required that the doors remain closed and locked during flight. Ong speculated that they had \\"jammed their way\\" in. Perhaps the terrorists stabbed the flight attendants to get a cockpit key, to force one of them to open the cockpit door, or to lure the captain or first officer out of the cockpit. Or the flight attendants may just have been in their way. At the same time or shortly thereafter, Atta-the only terrorist on board trained to fly a jet-would have moved to the cockpit from his business-class seat, possibly accompanied by Omari. As this was happening, passenger Daniel Lewin, who was seated in the row just behind Atta and Omari, was stabbed by one of the hijackers-probably Satam al Suqami, who was seated directly behind Lewin. Lewin had served four years as an officer in the Israeli military. He may have made an attempt to stop the hijackers in front of him, not realizing that another was sitting behind him. The hijackers quickly gained control and sprayed Mace, pepper spray, or some other irritant in the first-class cabin, in order to force the passengers and flight attendants toward the rear of the plane. They claimed they had a bomb. About five minutes after the hijacking began, Betty Ong contacted the American Airlines Southeastern Reservations Office in Cary, North Carolina, via an AT&T airphone to report an emergency aboard the flight. This was the first of several occasions on 9/11 when flight attendants took action outside the scope of their training, which emphasized that in a hijacking, they were to communicate with the cockpit crew. The emergency call lasted approximately 25 minutes, as Ong calmly and professionally relayed information about events taking place aboard the airplane to authorities on the ground. At 8:19, Ong reported:\\"The cockpit is not answering, somebody's stabbed in business class-and I think there's Mace-that we can't breathe-I don't know, I think we're getting hijacked.\\" She then told of the stabbings of the two flight attendants. At 8:21, one of the American employees receiving Ong's call in North Carolina, Nydia Gonzalez, alerted the American Airlines operations center in Fort Worth, Texas, reaching Craig Marquis, the manager on duty. Marquis soon realized this was an emergency and instructed the airline's dispatcher responsible for the flight to contact the cockpit.

All its life it had been asleep, but now it hardly got a chance for a nod, so swiftly did big events and crashing surprises come along in one another's wake: Friday morning, first glimpse of Real Nobility, also grand reception at Aunt Patsy Cooper's, also great robber raid; Friday evening, dramatic kicking of the heir of the chief citizen in presence of four hundred people; Saturday morning, emergence as practicing lawyer of the long-submerged Pudd'nhead Wilson; Saturday night, duel between chief citizen and titled stranger. The people took more pride in the duel than in all the other events put together, perhaps. It was a glory to their town to have such a thing happen there. In their eyes the principals had reached the summit of human honor. Everybody paid homage to their names; their praises were in all mouths. Even the duelists' subordinates came in for a handsome share of the public approbation: wherefore Pudd'nhead Wilson was suddenly become a man of consequence. When asked to run for the mayoralty Saturday night, he was risking defeat, but Sunday morning found him a made man and his success assured. After reading the above, is \\"The names of the 400 people present for the dramatic kicking of the heir of the chief citizen\\" the correct answer to the question \\"Whose names and praises were in everyone's mouths?\\"?

Translate to French.","completion":"Les articles concernant l'attribution de responsabilité se sont révélés particulièrement utiles. Les articles traitant de l'attribution de responsabilité ont montré leur utilité de manière significative. Ces éléments de documentation ont été d'un grand secours pour comprendre la manière dont la responsabilité est attribuée dans divers contextes et situations, qu'il s'agisse de responsabilité légale, morale ou éthique. Dans ces articles, on retrouve généralement une analyse approfondie des facteurs qui entrent en jeu lors de l'attribution de responsabilité, ainsi que des exemples pratiques pour illustrer ces notions. Parmi les facteurs abordés, on peut citer l'intention, la négligence, la causalité, le consentement, la connaissance et la capacité à agir. Les articles explorent également les implications de ces facteurs dans différentes situations, telles que les accidents, les préjudices causés à autrui, les obligations contractuelles et les responsabilités professionnelles. Souvent, les articles sur l'attribution de responsabilité mettent en lumière les différences entre les systèmes juridiques et éthiques dans diverses parties du monde. Ils permettent de comprendre comment les cultures, les traditions et les législations locales influencent la manière dont les individus et les organisations sont tenus responsables de leurs actions. Par exemple, il peut être intéressant de comparer les attitudes envers la responsabilité dans le contexte d'une société occidentale et dans celui d'une société asiatique. De plus, les articles examinent les conséquences de l'attribution de responsabilité sur les individus, les organisations et la société dans son ensemble. Ils abordent les questions liées à la reconnaissance des torts causés, aux excuses, à la réparation, à la punition et à la prévention des comportements irresponsables. Les auteurs de ces articles analysent également les effets psychologiques et sociaux de la responsabilité, ainsi que le rôle des institutions et des mécanismes de gouvernance pour encourager ou sanctionner les comportements responsables. Enfin, les articles sur l'attribution de responsabilité offrent souvent des pistes de réflexion pour améliorer les pratiques en matière de responsabilité et pour réduire le nombre de comportements irresponsables. Ils proposent des recommandations basées sur des recherches empiriques, des études de cas et des analyses philosophiques, qui peuvent contribuer à éclairer les décisions des législateurs, des juges, des avocats, des gestionnaires, des éducateurs et des citoyens dans leur quête d'une société plus juste et responsable. En somme, les articles relatifs à l'attribution de responsabilité ont bel et bien prouvé leur utilité. Ils permettent de mieux saisir les enjeux liés à la responsabilité, d'informer les débats et les décisions concernant ces questions, et de contribuer au développement de politiques et de pratiques plus éclairées et efficaces en matière de responsabilité dans divers domaines de la vie sociale et professionnelle."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Sean John Combs was born on November 4, 1969 in Manhattan's Harlem neighborhood in New York City, and was raised in Mount Vernon, New York. His mother, Janice (Smalls), was a model and teacher's assistant, and his father, Melvin Earl Combs, served in the U.S. Air Force and was an associate of convicted New York drug dealer Frank Lucas. At age 33, Melvin was shot to death while sitting in his car on Central Park West, when Combs was 2 years old. Combs graduated from the Roman Catholic Mount Saint Michael Academy in 1987. On February 26, 2014, Combs premiered \\"Big Homie\\", featuring Rick Ross and French Montana, as the first single from his mixtape MMM (Money Making Mitch), which was originally scheduled to be released that year. The song was released for digital download on March 24, and two days later the trailer for the music video was released. The full version of the music video was released on March 31. Combs used his former stage name Puff Daddy for the album. MMM was released as a free mixtape album of 12 tracks on November 4, 2015. In 2014 Combs and Guy Gerber announced that their joint album 11 11 would be available for free download. A new single called \\"Finna Get Loose\\" featuring Combs and Pharrell Williams was released on June 29, 2015. In July 2015, Bad Boy Entertainment artist Gizzle told the press that she is collaborating with Combs on what she describes as his last album, titled No Way Out 2, a sequel to his 1997 debut. She describes the music as unique: \\"The mindset is to just be classic and to be epic. And to really live up to that ... we know it's a tall order, but we welcome the challenge.\\" In April 2016, Combs announced that after this last album and tour, he plans to retire from the music industry to focus on acting.

The initial statement, \\"If Wouldn't that move condoms!\\" is challenging to interpret due to its phrasing, so it is not possible to tell whether or not it would be accurate to conclude that \\"Wouldn't that sell more condoms that way?\\". However, let us analyze the unclear phrasing and attempt to find a possible meaning. \\"If Wouldn't that move condoms!\\" seems to be an exclamation or question with an unclear structure. It is possible that it may be asking whether a certain action or event would lead to an increase in the sale or usage of condoms. If this were the case, the phrasing might be intended to say, \\"If that event happens, wouldn't that move (cause the distribution, sale, or use of) more condoms?\\" It is worth noting that both statements seem to be related to an increase in condom sales or usage resulting from any particular action or event. In this context, they could be asking the same question – whether something would result in more condoms being sold or used. However, without additional context, such as what the action or event being referred to is, it is impossible to determine whether the statement \\"Wouldn't that sell more condoms that way?\\" would be a valid conclusion based on the initial statement. The options for interpretation are too broad, and any conclusion would require assumptions based on the meaning and intent of the original statement.

Article: A scientist turns out to be able to see the future by offering each of some four-year-olds a piece of candy and watching how he or she deals with it. Some children reach eagerly for the treat they see. Some last a few minutes before they give in. But others are determined to wait until the last moment. By the time the children reach high school, something remarkable has happened. A survey found that those who as four-year-olds had enough self-control to hold out generally grew up to be more popular, adventurous, confident and dependable. The children who gave in to temptation early were more likely to be lonely, easily frustrated and inflexible . Actually, the ability to delay reward is a sign of emotional intelligence which doesn't show up on an IQ test. The hardware of the brain and the software of the mind have long been scientists' concerns. But brain theory can't explain what we wonder about most, like the question why some people remain _ in the face of troubles that would sink a less resistant soul. Here comes the theory of Daniel Goleman, writer of Emotional Intelligence: when it comes to predicting people's success, brain ability measured by IQ may actually matter less than the qualities of mind once thought of as \\"character\\". EQ is not the opposite of IQ. What researchers have been trying to understand is how they work together; how one's ability to handle stress, for instance, affects the ability to concentrate and put intelligence to use. Among the ingredients for success, researchers now generally agree that IQ counts for about 20%; the rest depends on everything from social class to luck. While many researchers in this relatively new field are glad to see emotional issues finally taken seriously, some few fear EQ invites misuse. Question: The experiment with the four-year-olds makes it clear that _ . - the age of 4 is a proper time for scientific experiment - emotional intelligence won't show up until adolescence - the ability of self-control plays a role in personal success - candy can be used to measure a person's emotional intelligence The answer is:","completion":"- the ability of self-control plays a role in personal success"},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Let's solve the equation step by step. The equation is 17r = -9r - 104. Step 1: Combine like terms We'll start by getting all the terms with 'r' on one side of the equation.

This gives: 17r + 9r = -9r + 9r - 104 Which simplifies to: 26r = -104 Step 2: Solve for 'r' Now we can solve for 'r' by dividing both sides of the equation by 26: 26r/26 = -104/26 which gives: r = -4 So, the solution to the equation is r = -4."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Without Leap Day ,which takes place every four years, that could happen. Our calendar is normally 365 days long. It was created to match the cycles of the seasons. But Roman ruler Julius Caesar noticed a problem: The earth doesn't circle the sun in exactly 365 days. It actually cakes 365 and one-quarter days. He figured out that the extra part of a day would cause the calendar to grow apart from the seasons over time. Over 100 years, the seasons would shift about 24 days. Spring would start on April 13 instead of March 20. Caesar used math to figure out a way to stop the calendar from shifting. He decided to add an extra day to the month of February every four years. His idea helped keep the seasons and calendar matched up. Even so, it still wasn't perfect--his calendar was adding too many days. In 1582, Pope Gregory XIII worked on Caesar's idea. His calendar, called the Gregorian calendar, declares that every year that is equally divided by 400 is a leap year. Turn-of-the-century years, or years ending in \\"00\\", would not be leap years unless they could be divided equally by 400. These complicated equations help keep the calendar in balance with the orbit of the earth. Today, we still use the Gregorian calendar. In about 3,000 years, the calendar will be only one day out of step with the seasons, It's still not perfect, but mathematicians decided it was as close as we could get.

Ann lived in a mountain village at 8000 ft altitude, while Dee lived in a coastal town at sea level. Which cousin experienced fewer thunderstorms? Hint: Because the Earth's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane, sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year. In June the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun, so at any given Northern Hemisphere latitude sunlight falls more directly on that spot than in December (see Effect of sun angle on climate). This effect causes seasons. Over thousands to hundreds of thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbital parameters affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth and influence long-term climate. (See Milankovitch cycles).The uneven solar heating (the formation of zones of temperature and moisture gradients, or frontogenesis) can also be due to the weather itself in the form of cloudiness and precipitation. Higher altitudes are typically cooler than lower altitudes, which the result of higher surface temperature and radiational heating, which produces the adiabatic lapse rate. In some situations, the temperature actually increases with height. This phenomenon is known as an inversion and can cause mountaintops to be warmer than the valleys below. Inversions can lead to the formation of fog and often act as a cap that suppresses thunderstorm development. On local scales, temperature differences can occur because different surfaces (such as oceans, forests, ice sheets, or man-made objects) have differing physical characteristics such as reflectivity, roughness, or moisture content. Answer:","completion":"Dee, who lived in a coastal town at sea level, would experience fewer thunderstorms as compared to Ann, who lived at a higher altitude of 8,000 feet in a mountain village. The primary reason for this is that higher altitudes generally experience cooler temperatures due to the adiabatic lapse rate. As altitude increases, the air temperature decreases. This is a result of higher surface temperatures and radiational heating at lower altitudes. Cooler temperatures at higher altitudes facilitate the formation of clouds and the development of thunderstorms, making it more likely for Ann to experience them at her mountain village. Another factor that contributes to fewer thunderstorms at lower altitudes is the presence of temperature inversions. In some cases, the temperature at higher altitudes can be warmer than that at lower altitudes, known as an inversion. Inversions can lead to the formation of fog and act as a cap that suppresses thunderstorm development. This further reduces the likelihood of thunderstorms occurring in the coastal town where Dee resides. Moreover, local temperature differences due to varying surface characteristics (such as oceans, forests, ice sheets, or man-made objects) can also influence the occurrence of thunderstorms. Coastal areas, like the one where Dee lives, tend to have more stable and moderated temperatures because of their proximity to water bodies, which might also contribute to fewer thunderstorms. In summary, Dee, living at sea level in a coastal town, is likely to experience fewer thunderstorms than her cousin Ann, who resides at a higher altitude in a mountain village. The primary reasons for this are the cooler temperatures experienced at higher altitudes and the occasional presence of temperature inversions, along with local factors related to the specific environments of their homes."},{"prompt":"Bailey can't stand the food even after having lived in the country for three years.

A paraphrase, by definition, is a restatement of the text that retains the original message while changing the phrasing, word choice, and syntax to some extent. Even though the words may be varied slightly, a paraphrase ideally retains the full context and semantic meaning of the original sentence. In the given context, both sentences carry the same subject - 'The wrestling team' and impart the same information. They describe the same event, detailing that the wrestling team won the Non-Public, South B sectional title in 2006 by defeating Sacred Heart High School with a score of 45-31 in the tournament final. The tokens or words 'sectional title' and 'section title' are the only variance between the two sentences but essentially, they carry the same meaning within the semantics of the subject. Therefore, while there is slight variation in one phrase, both sentences can be classified as paraphrases since they don't significantly change the original meaning and context, which is the fundamental requirement for a text or sentence to be considered as a paraphrase of another.

Summarize the following: Keep in mind that, as a CSI, you will be entrusted to handle evidence and possibly testify in court. Expect law enforcement agencies to favor applicants with a clean record. Anticipate a background check when you apply. Refrain from criminal behavior. Agencies will still consider applicants with less than spotless records. So don’t worry if you incur minor infractions, like parking tickets or noise complaints. Deal with them in a timely manner to demonstrate responsibility. Concentrate on sciences, including biology, chemistry, and physics. Take electives that focus on computers, since these are important tools in the CSI’s lab. Use less obvious courses, clubs, and activities to strengthen other skillsets that CSIs need to perform their jobs effectively. For instance: Participate in theater or the debate club to become a confident public speaker. Join the school paper to practice writing concise reports. Take part in photography clubs or classes. Although educational requirements vary by agency, give yourself the most options possible by pursuing some level of higher learning. Aim for an associate’s, bachelor’s, or master’s degree from an accredited college or university. If possible, enroll in a school that offers degrees in criminal justice, forensic science, and/or crime scene investigations. If not, major in biology, chemistry, or a similar hard science. Some agencies may only require a high school diploma or general education diploma (GED). However, these agencies are more likely to be found in areas with very small populations and fewer CSI positions to fill. If you are unable or uninterested in pursuing a traditional degree through a two- or four-year school, consider alternate means.

But before they started, some of the people had to keep their hands in water for half an hour. The researchers found that the people with wrinkled fingers completed the task the task faster than those with dry hands. But when they were asked to move dry marbles, all the people performed equally well, no matter they had the wrinkled fingers or not. Our ancestors might not have played with marbles, but wrinkled fingers could have made it easier for them to climb around in the wet forests and catch fish from rivers, researchers say. Similarly, our toes also get wrinkled in water. This may have developed from our ancestor's need to run on wet ground. But the question is, if wrinkled fingers are so helpful, why don't our hands just stay that way all the time? Researchers explained that wrinkling has its disadvantage: wet fingertips are far less sensitive than smooth ones, reducing our sense of touch. Question: What might be the disadvantage of wrinkled fingers? Answer: A:","completion":"The disadvantage of wrinkled fingers is that they are far less sensitive than smooth ones, which reduces our sense of touch. This decreased sensitivity can make it more difficult for us to perform tasks that require precise and subtle tactile feedback. While wrinkled fingers can offer better grip in wet conditions, our hands do not always need to have wrinkled fingers because the trade-off of reduced touch sensitivity would hinder us in everyday tasks for which a heightened sense of touch is more important."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Tom Gardner. PUBLISHED:. 05:03 EST, 7 June 2013. |. UPDATED:. 07:41 EST, 7 June 2013. Even the most diligent of AS-level students may not have been fully prepared for one of the questions in their recent Latin exam. Young classicists – usually aged between 16 and 17 – were asked to read and offer a ‘personal response’ to an ancient but explicit account of sexual intercourse. The passage from The Amores - one of Ovid’s collection of erotic poetry - describes in the racy embrace of two lovers. Erotic: An erotic scene from Ovid's The Amores, as painted by Adolphe. William Bouguereau, caused controversy among academics after its inclusion in an AS-level exam. A version of the poem translates on. passage as '... slip off your chemise without a blush and let him get. his thigh well over yours. 'And. let him thrust his tongue as far as it will go into your coral mouth. and let passion prompt you to all manner of pretty devices. '... slip off your chemise without a blush and let him get his thigh well over yours. 'And let him thrust his tongue as far as it will go into your coral mouth and let passion prompt you to all manner of pretty devices. 'Talk lovingly. Say all sorts of naughty things, and let the bed creak and groan as you writhe with pleasure.' Ovid Amores III.14, translation by J. Lewis May. 'Talk lovingly. Say all sorts of naughty things, and let the bed creak and groan as you writhe with pleasure.' The addition of the passage, which was part of a longer section of verse from Ovid's poems published in the 1st century BC, in the exam for children provoked consternation from one leading academic. Professor John Ellis, a reader in. physics at Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge, and fellow at Gonville and. Caius College, said the exam board was not in their 'right minds' to. include the passage for children as young as 16. He told the Times: 'How would a school. react to such material distributed on their premises? 'Many teachers. would have glossed over this extract, assuming no one in their right. minds would set it in an exam.' The text featured in an AS-level Latin. paper on Tuesday set by the University of Cambridge OCR board. Controversial: The inclusion of passages from explicit erotic poetry in AS-level exams - typically sat by pupils aged 16 and 17 - has been criticised by a leading academic. (file picture) Students were awarded up to 10 marks out of a total of 100 on the paper for their answers.Mary Beard, Professor of Classics at. Cambridge, defended the inclusion of the text, telling the Times: 'Please, let's not go back to the days. when kids were not supposed to read some poems of, say, Catullus,. because some old codger had thought they might get corrupted.' An OCR spokesman said not including the passages would be tantamount to 'censorship' and would deny students the opportunity to study some of the finest elegiac poems ever written. The elegiac style is a poetic technique where each couplet usually makes sense on its own, while forming part of a larger work. The spokesman said: 'Ovid’s Amores. poems are considered by professionals to be some of the finest examples. of elegiac poetry that there are. 'To censor such material would only. leave young adults with a false perception of their area of study. If. such censorship were to be applied to English literature it would. preclude coverage of the works of DH Lawrence, Chaucer and even. Shakespeare.' Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"In a Latin exam for students around 16-17 years old, there was a question about an ancient poem called \\"The Amores\\" by Ovid. This poem has some parts that describe people being romantic and very close with each other in a way some people think is not appropriate for younger students. A teacher named Professor John Ellis thinks it was wrong to include this poem in the exam, but other teachers, like Professor Mary Beard, believe students should be allowed to read and learn from these poems. The people who made the exam say that not allowing the poem would be like \\"censorship\\" and would give the students a wrong idea about what they are studying."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Step 2: Determine if the second sentence being true is dependent on the first sentence being true - The second sentence is also a coherent and understandable question, but it specifically focuses on a goal related to city expansion and time frame for achievement. The truth of the second sentence does not rely on the truth of the first sentence, as they can both stand independently as valid questions.

Kitty is allied with Humpty Alexander Dumpty, a talking egg and Puss' long-estranged childhood friend from the orphanage where he was raised. Puss tells Kitty his origin story and of his feelings of betrayal for a youthful misadventure when Humpty tricked Puss into helping commit a bank robbery in his hometown of San Ricardo; Puss has been on the run ever since. Humpty eventually convinces Puss to join them in finding the beans and retrieving the golden eggs.The trio steal the beans from Jack and Jill and plant them in the desert. Puss and Kitty's relationship becomes romantic. The trio ride the beanstalk into the clouds to find the castle of the late giant, while avoiding the Great Terror, a mysterious monster that guards the Golden Goose. When they realize the golden eggs are too heavy to carry, they steal the Goose, which is just a gosling, and escape the castle. While celebrating their victory, the group is ambushed by Jack and Jill, who knock Puss unconscious.When Puss wakes up, he tracks Jack and Jill to San Ricardo where he learns the entire heist was a plot by Humpty to lure him home to be captured, as revenge for abandoning him to the authorities when Humpty's youthful heist went bad.

Question: \\"Under what circumstances could the pope announce the appointment?\\" Context: \\"If conditions change, so that the pope judges it safe to make the appointment public, he may do so at any time. The cardinal in question then ranks in precedence with those raised to the cardinalate at the time of his in pectore appointment. If a pope dies before revealing the identity of an in pectore cardinal, the cardinalate expires.\\" Answer:","completion":"The Pope can announce the appointment of an in pectore cardinal under various circumstances, particularly when he deems it safe and appropriate to reveal the identity of the person selected for this honor. In pectore, which is Latin for \\"in the heart,\\" is a method used by the Pope to appoint cardinals confidentially when revealing their identity could potentially lead to negative consequences for the cardinal, the Church, or the relations with certain countries or groups. The detailed circumstances under which the Pope could announce the appointment include: 1. Improved political or religious situation: If the Pope initially withheld the identity of an in pectore cardinal due to a hostile political or religious environment, he might announce the appointment if the situation improves, and it becomes safe to disclose the person's identity. 2. Resolution of conflicts: If the cardinal in pectore has been involved in any active conflicts, controversies, or disputes that might endanger them or create unrest within the Church, the Pope may reveal the appointment once those conflicts have been resolved or have significantly subsided. 3. Protection of the cardinal's mission: In some cases, the Pope might have appointed a cardinal in pectore to undertake a sensitive mission or work discreetly in regions where the Church faces challenges. The Pope may reveal the appointment once the mission is accomplished, or the risks associated with their position are minimized. 4. Demonstrating support for persecuted groups: The Pope might have appointed a cardinal in pectore to send a message of support and solidarity to persecuted religious minorities or specific regions experiencing difficulties. Announcing the appointment publicly at the right time could serve to strengthen the Vatican's position and encourage dialogue between different parties. 5. Strengthening the Church's presence: In some circumstances, the Pope may decide to reveal the identity of an in pectore cardinal to strengthen the Church's presence in a strategic region or country. This can be helpful in fostering relationships with governments or religious communities, particularly when Catholicism has experienced persecution or a lack of freedom in those areas. When the Pope eventually announces an in pectore appointment, the cardinal takes their place in the order of precedence alongside other cardinals of the same rank appointed at the same time. However, if the Pope passes away before announcing the identity of an in pectore cardinal, the individual's cardinalate expires, and their appointment is not carried forward. In conclusion, the Pope has the authority to announce an in pectore cardinal's appointment whenever he feels it is appropriate and safe, considering the various circumstances related to the Church, the cardinal, and the global political and religious landscape. Announcing the appointment can serve multiple purposes, such as fostering dialogue between persecuted groups or strengthening the Church's presence in strategic regions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In this case, Greuze's pretense revolves around not noticing something, presumably an event or a piece of information. The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that \\"Greuze acted as if he didn't notice.\\" This statement suggests that Greuze portrayed himself as being unaware or not observant of a specific situation or event. In essence, the hypothesis is asking whether Greuze's external behavior was in accordance with someone who didn't genuinely notice something. Upon comparing the premise and the hypothesis, it becomes evident that the essence of both statements is quite similar. The act of \\"pretending\\" in the premise aligns closely with the concept of \\"acting as if\\" in the hypothesis. In both instances, Greuze is consciously displaying a behavior that suggests he is oblivious to something, when in reality, he might very well be aware of it. Therefore, given the similarity in the meanings of these two statements, we can conclude that the hypothesis \\"Greuze acted as if he didn't notice.\\" can be considered true based on the premise \\"Greuze pretended not to notice.\\" Both statements convey the idea that Greuze engaged in an intentional act to create a false impression of unobservance or unawareness, which ties them together as related conclusions derived from the given behavior."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Therefore, this answer does not provide an accurate description of what a solid becomes when the temperature changes. - Liquid: As mentioned earlier, when temperature changes cause a solid to gain enough thermal energy to break the molecular or atomic bonds that hold it together, it will transform into a liquid state. This is the correct answer. - Moves: Although temperature changes can cause substances to move, this term does not accurately describe what a solid becomes. Instead, it describes how substances can change and interact in response to temperature changes, but not the transformation of a solid into another state of matter. - A new compound: Temperature changes do not create a new compound. The chemical composition of a substance remains the same during the change from solid to liquid, so the answer is incorrect. - Support: This term is not relevant to the question, as it does not describe a state of matter or the transformation of a solid due to temperature changes. - Solid phase: The term \\"solid phase\\" describes the state in which a substance exists before the temperature change. When a solid melts due to temperature changes, it becomes a liquid rather than remaining in the solid phase. - Glass: Glass is a unique amorphous solid that does not possess a crystal structure. When heated, glass can undergo a transition to a liquid-like state. However, this is not the universal result of temperature changes on solids, so the answer is incorrect. - Crystallized: Crystallization is a process in which atoms or molecules arrange themselves in a highly ordered structure, forming a crystal. It typically occurs when a liquid cools down and turns into a solid, meaning that this term does not describe what occurs when a solid melts and turns into a liquid due to temperature changes. In conclusion, the correct answer is \\"liquid.\\" A solid becomes a liquid when temperature changes provide it with enough thermal energy to overcome the forces holding its molecules or atoms in place, causing them to flow and adopt the properties of a liquid state."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Tottakai meillä myös Euroopan unionissa on syytä parantaa naisten asemaa kaikilla elämän aloilla, mutta ennen kaikkea nyt on kyse maailmanlaajuisesta konferenssista. Translate to English English:","completion":"Indeed, we also have reason to improve the status of women in all areas of life within the European Union, but above all, we are now talking about a global conference. In the European Union, there is a pressing need to improve the status of women across various aspects of life, reflecting concerns that extend beyond the borders of individual European countries. This endeavor is particularly pertinent in light of the fact that a global conference addressing the same issue is currently being organized. In recent years, the promotion of gender equality has emerged as a key policy objective for the European Union. Acknowledging the disparities persisting between men and women in areas such as education, employment, political representation, and societal attitudes, the EU has taken several measures to reduce gender-based inequalities and empower women both within the institution and across member states. A global conference on the topic of women's status and rights could serve as an essential platform for promoting cross-national cooperation and knowledge-sharing on what works best in achieving gender equality. By gathering relevant stakeholders from around the world, the conference would foster dialogue, build connections, and allow for strategies and best practices to emerge organically. Several areas of focus could be explored during the global conference, including: 1. Education: Ensuring equal access to high-quality education for girls and boys is vital for promoting gender equality. Addressing gender stereotypes within educational materials and promoting women’s representation in male-dominated fields such as STEM could be discussed in depth during the conference. 2. Employment: The gender pay gap and unequal access to opportunities remain pressing issues globally. Panel discussions could be held on various strategies for lowering barriers for women in the workforce, including promoting flexible working hours, providing affordable childcare, and ensuring equal pay for equal work. 3. Political representation: Encouraging women to participate in political decision-making can have a positive impact on policy outcomes. The conference could explore the effectiveness of various strategies such as gender quotas, mentorship programs, and political party policies that aim to increase women's paricipation in politics. 4. Legal frameworks and policy initiatives: Implementing comprehensive legislation to address gender discrimination and violence against women is crucial for achieving gender equality. Representatives from different countries could share the successes and difficulties they have encountered in implementing such policies. 5. Societal attitudes: Tackling deep-rooted gender stereotypes and norms that influence individual behavior is essential for achieving gender equality. Workshops could be organized to shed light on successful campaigns and community-based interventions that aim to change public opinion and promote gender equality. By focusing on a range of topics, this global conference could mark a pivotal moment in the push for gender equality and the empowerment of women worldwide. Participants would have an invaluable opportunity to exchange knowledge, best practices, and lessons learned, paving the way for more inclusive and equal societies for people of all genders."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I'm still trying to wrap my mind around it. Suicide. Walter wasn't suicidal. I know that, know it for a fact. But he is dead. Why? I am not foolish enough to suspect \\"foul play\\" as they say in the mystery stories. No one cares enough about a community college art teacher to murder him. But suicide? Something is wrong here. Very wrong. April 2, 2006 I didn't realize until this morning that yesterday was April Fools day. Some kind of sick joke? But that's not like Walter either. He was a little crazy, but not that kind of crazy. Still I keep half expecting to pick up my voice and hear his voice yell, \\"Gotcha!\\" But it is no joke. I know he is dead. (Later) Got a package today. From Walter. Scary considering what I wrote about expecting him to call. I can't express the chill I got when I saw his name on the label. A message from the dead. Surely it's not a good Omen. It's a painting. Or at least I think it is. The package is the right shape, and knowing Walter it seems likely, but...I haven't yet worked up the courage to open it yet. I'm afraid of what I might find. April 3, 2006 Went to the funeral today. Walter's wife, Martha, was in hysterics. Can't say I blame her. It was awkward being there seeing someone in the most vulnerable possible condition. I didn't know her that well. Walter and I rarely interacted outside of work, so I have very little knowledge of his personal life. Sylvia went up to her and hugged her even though she'd never met her before in her life. It must be something with women to be able to make that kind of spontaneous connection. I just shook her hand, and told her I was sorry. I don't make a habit of crying in public, but seeing her so shaken up brought tears to the edges of my eyes, and I did nothing to wipe them away. After five years of friendship it's the least Walter deserves of me. One other thing. The package. It's still sitting there in my study. Mocking me. That's how it feels anyway. Should...

His rival Jean Ping has called for a general strike and says dozens of his supporters have been killed. Mr Moundounga is the first senior government minister to resign over the election result. The Gabonese authorities say three people have died and 105 have been injured following violent clashes and mass arrests that have taken place since the election result was announced. Other reports put the death toll at at least six. There have been more than 800 arrests and France says several people with dual French-Gabonese citizenship remain unaccounted for. The official election result gave Mr Bongo a second seven-year term with 49.8% of the vote to Mr Ping's 48.2% - a margin of 5,594 votes. Mr Ping won in six out of nine provinces but disputes the result in Mr Bongo's home province of Haut-Ogooue, where turnout was 99.93% and 95% of votes were for the president.

Representing yourself in court can be a tricky endeavor. There are confusing legal terms to learn, strict procedures to follow and volumes of case law that often need to be understood to prepare a case. Lake County officials and a private agency that assists indigent litigants in Illinois want to make the practice easier by creating a self-help center for people who choose to represent themselves in legal matters. The center, which will be housed in the law library at the main courthouse in Waukegan, could open later this summer. \\"I think it's going to be extremely helpful,\\" Court Administrator Bob Zastany said. \\"There is a population out there that will take advantage of this resource.\\" The self-help center will be the only one of its kind in the county. Only a few operate nationwide, officials said. The project is the work of Lake County circuit court officials and Prairie State Legal Services, a statewide agency with an office in Waukegan that provides information and legal assistance to poor and elderly Illinois residents. The organization has received a 25,000 grant from the Illinois Equal Justice Foundation, a nonprofit group that funds programs designed to increase access to legal information and assistance, to help pay for the effort. Prairie State will share the money with the county. The county's law library is on the first floor of the governmental center at 18 N. County St. The new self-help center will be designed to help litigants find the information they need to properly represent themselves in court, an undertaking that can be complicated and confusing. \\"Some people can do OK on their own, and some people can do OK with some help,\\" said Linda Rothnagel, the managing attorney for Prairie State Legal Services. \\"But other people can't do it. It's not always easy.\\" Self-representation is a right affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court. The practice is far more common in civil matters than in criminal cases. In fact, self-represented litigants - formally called \\"pro se\\" in Latin, or \\"for oneself\\" - in criminal defenses are so rare that statistics about the practice generally are not kept, legal experts say.

Here is the step-by-step justification for this choice: 1. Analyze the options: To answer this question, we need to consider the possible options provided and determine which one is the most likely to cause a distraction for the driver. 2. Eliminate irrelevant options: We can eliminate \\"car crash\\" and \\"automobile accidents\\", as these are consequences of distracted driving, rather than causes. 3. Assess remaining options: a. Use mobile phone: Operating a mobile phone while driving can be an extremely dangerous distraction. Answering calls, texting, or browsing through social media or emails can divert a driver's attention from the road, leading to dangerous situations. b. Smoke: Smoking while driving is another driver behavior that can cause distraction. The need to light a cigarette and handle it while driving occupies at least one of the driver's hands and can take eyes off the road for seconds at a time; not to mention the continuous action to dispose of ash or smoke expelled. c. Backache: While a backache can cause discomfort while driving, it is not an active action taken by the driver. It may possibly decrease the driver's overall focus but is not a direct cause of distraction. 4. Decide on the best answer: Given that using a mobile phone is a more dangerous and prevalent cause of distracted driving, it would be reasonable to argue that it is a better answer than \\"smoke\\". However, since your belief is that \\"smoke\\" is the correct choice, we could emphasize that smoking is still a relevant distractor while driving. In conclusion, \\"smoke\\" is a justifiable choice for a driver behavior that could distract him or her while driving, as it requires the driver to engage in multiple actions involving hands and eyes, which could otherwise be dedicated to driving safely."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: The bee had to be shipped down south to avoid the cold winter, where was it originally from? Choices: - michigan - united states - sky - china - apiary The rationale to choose \\"michigan\\" as the answer is that:","completion":"Michigan is the most appropriate answer among the given choices due to several reasons which include its location, climate, and relevance to bee populations. Let's break down each choice and understand why Michigan is the best answer. 1. Michigan: Located in the United States, Michigan is known for its cold winter season with harsh temperatures, snowfall, and freezing conditions. These conditions can be unsuitable for bees, which prefer warmer temperatures and a stable environment to survive, reproduce, and collect nectar. Hence, the bees would need to be shipped down south to avoid the unfavorable winter conditions experienced in Michigan, making it the most logical option. 2. United States: Although Michigan is a part of the United States, the entire United States is not necessarily characterized by cold winter weather. The southern states of the US generally experience warmer climates, which could provide a suitable environment for bees that are shipped from colder regions. Thus, saying the bee was originally from the United States is too broad and doesn't pinpoint a specific location where harsh winters would warrant shipping bees to the south. 3. Sky: The term \\"sky\\" is not relevant to the context of the question, as it refers to the atmosphere and space visible from the Earth's surface. Bees inhabit terrestrial environments like forests, meadows, and gardens, and their hives are found on or close to the ground or on trees and other structures. As a result, the sky is not applicable as an option for the bee's original location. 4. China: While China does have regions that experience cold winter climates, it is a separate country from the United States. Shipping bees down south would imply a repositioning within the same country, i.e., from a colder area to a warmer one. It's also important to consider that shipping bees internationally is subject to strict regulations and guidelines in order to prevent the spread of disease and protect local ecosystems. Therefore, China is not the best option in this context. 5. Apiary: An apiary refers to a place where beehives are kept, usually for beekeeping and honey production. While apiaries can be located in a variety of climates and regions, it is not a suitable option as it does not give information on the original location from which the bee had to be relocated to escape cold winters. Apiaries could be found in areas with milder climates as well, so this option doesn't provide enough context or specificity. In conclusion, based on the context and rationale provided, Michigan is the most accurate answer among the given choices. It is a specific location known for its cold winters, where bees may not be able to thrive and would require relocation to warmer southern regions."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

News article: KIEV, Ukraine — On a Sunday in December when the Ukrainian uprising seemed about to tip into wide-scale violence, Petro Poroshenko, a pro-Western billionaire, thrust himself between antigovernment protesters and riot police officers clashing outside the presidential headquarters, climbed on a bulldozer that was threatening to plow through the crowd and grabbed an orange plastic megaphone. “Friends, calm down,” he shouted, as pro-government thugs brought in to antagonize the demonstrators cursed him and hurled anti-Semitic slurs, though he is a member of the Ukrainian Orthodox faith, not Jewish. As chaos swirled, Mr. Poroshenko, 48, stood his ground, helping keep injuries to a minimum, but also cementing his status as a leader of the pro-European opposition and defying the stereotype of the superrich above it all. Now, with less than a week to go until a presidential election here, Mr. Poroshenko is once again at the center of a fracas that most of his fellow oligarchs would rather avoid. The latest polls show Mr. Poroshenko, a confection magnate known as the Chocolate King, as the heavy favorite, likely to avoid a runoff with his strongest opponent, former Prime Minister Yulia V. Tymoshenko. Ms. Tymoshenko insists that the polls are wrong and that she will surge ahead. A poll by the Kiev International Institute of Sociology, conducted April 29 to May 11, found Mr. Poroshenko supported by 34 percent of all voters, compared with 6 percent for Ms. Tymoshenko and 4 percent for Sergey Tigipko, a member of Parliament and former economics minister; 25 percent said they were undecided. The survey had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. Among voters who said they had made up their minds, Mr. Poroshenko was supported by 54.7 percent — enough to avoid a runoff — with 9.6 percent for Ms. Tymoshenko and 6.7 percent for Mr. Tigipko. With the country still roiled by separatist violence in the east, the growing air of inevitability around Mr. Poroshenko, who has deep business interests in Russia, has redrawn the Ukraine conflict. It has presented the Kremlin with the prospect of a clear negotiating partner, apparently contributing, officials and analysts say, to a softening in the stance of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. After weeks of threatening an invasion, Mr. Putin now seems to have closed off the possibility of a Crimea-style land grab in the east, and even issued guarded support for the election to go forward. “You can have a kind of a civil war and this kind of gray zone and be completely separated and face a higher degree of economic sanctions,” said Adrian Karatnycky, an expert on Ukraine at the Atlantic Council, describing the choice facing Mr. Putin. “Or you can see if it’s possible to bargain with this new guy, who has businesses in Russia, who has never been known to be a big ultranationalist.” Mr. Poroshenko is a veteran of Ukrainian politics, having served as foreign minister under President Viktor A. Yushchenko; as economics minister under the ousted president, Viktor F. Yanukovych; and as a longtime member of Parliament, including a stint as speaker. “The reasoning on Poroshenko is that he is a pragmatist and he was in the Yanukovych government,” Mr. Karatnycky said. “He is a person who is a dealmaker. From that point of view, it may mean that Putin is willing to give it a chance of trying to get something out of this.” Continue reading the main story Advertisement Exactly what Mr. Putin wants to get remains to be seen. Some analysts believe he wants a guarantee that Ukraine will not join NATO. Others think he will settle only for a federalized government that permanently weakens Kiev, while still others believe he will continue destabilizing the country. Recently, Mr. Poroshenko has struck a conciliatory tone, promising to mend ties with Russia and saying at a news conference on Sunday that he opposed holding a referendum on Ukrainian membership in NATO. He has also sought to bring normalcy to the campaign, assuring voters that he will provide security if elected but stressing a more traditional message: jobs. “A new way of life means to be well off,” Mr. Poroshenko said, repeating his campaign slogan during a recent visit to a turbine factory in the eastern city of Kharkiv. “A new way of life means that the priority of any government, any authority should be to create new jobs. Our first goal is to guarantee security to all who live in Ukraine, to lead us out of the state of military tension.” In recent weeks, however, he has kept some distance from the provisional government, which is viewed with deep suspicion in the east. Mr. Poroshenko’s support for European integration will inevitably complicate his talks with Russia if he is elected. There is also a personal element to any negotiations. The Russian government has seized and closed a main factory and warehouse of his company, Roshen, in Lipetsk in southern Russia. Among Ukraine’s political cognoscenti, Mr. Poroshenko’s election is regarded these days as a foregone conclusion. “He is going to be president,” said Mustafa Nayyem, a reporter with the online news site Ukrainska Pravda who is leading a team preparing the questions for debates on Channel 1, the national television station. Mr. Poroshenko’s views already carry heavy influence in the provisional government in Kiev, including his belief that the government must crack down on armed insurgents in the east. In some respects, Mr. Poroshenko is already being treated as president-in-waiting. In recent weeks, he has been meeting regularly with world leaders. But while the West seems excited about the prospect of a Poroshenko presidency, some good-government advocates in Ukraine fear that Mr. Poroshenko’s business interests and his ties to other oligarchs may mean he would largely maintain the status quo. Mr. Poroshenko’s path to the presidency was eased substantially in March when his main rival, the former boxer Vitali Klitschko, agreed to drop out of the race, endorse Mr. Poroshenko and run for mayor of Kiev instead. The deal was reached at a meeting in Vienna orchestrated by Dmitry V. Firtash, the gas-trading tycoon, who was a longtime political patron of Mr. Yanukovych and has close business ties to Gazprom, the Russian state-controlled energy giant. Mr. Firtash’s role has raised concerns among some Western officials who are hoping to prevent a recurrence of surreptitious and corrupt side deals that have bedeviled Ukraine since Soviet times. During a recent 90-minute debate between Mr. Poroshenko and two other candidates, he seemed comfortable with the attention accorded him as front-runner. He spoke easily, his words punctuated by hand gestures. His positions were mostly uncontroversial, but with a clear Western bent. “The main direction of development has to be European integration,” he said at one point, “And it’s not a subject for discussion.” ||||| Russia appeals for the immediate halt of punitive operations and use of force, withdrawal of troops, and resolution of the various problems through peaceful means alone.

Geomatics (including geomatics engineering), also known as surveying engineering or geospatial science (including geospatial engineering and geospatial technology), is the discipline of gathering, storing, processing, and delivering geographic information or spatially referenced information. In other words, it \\"consists of products, services and tools involved in the collection, integration and management of geographic data\\". Michel Paradis, a French-Canadian surveyor, introduced \\"geomatics\\" as a new scientific term in an article published in 1981 in \\"The Canadian Surveyor\\" and in a keynote address at the centennial congress of the Canadian Institute of Surveying in April 1982. He claimed that at the end of the 20th century the needs for geographical information would reach a scope without precedent in history and in order to address these needs, it was necessary to integrate in a new discipline both the traditional disciplines of land surveying and the new tools and techniques of data capture, manipulation, storage and diffusion. Geomatics includes the tools and techniques used in land surveying, remote sensing, cartography, geographic information systems (GIS), global-navigation satellite systems (GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, Compass), photogrammetry, geophysics, geography, and related forms of earth mapping. The term was originally used in Canada, because it is similar in origin to both French and English, but has since been adopted by the International Organization for Standardization, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, and many other international authorities, although some (especially in the United States) have shown a preference for the term \\"geospatial technology\\".

India (ISO: Bhārat), also known as the Republic of India (ISO: Bhārat Gaṇarājya), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh largest country by area and with more than 1.3 billion people, it is the second most populous country as well as the most populous democracy in the world. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives, while its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. The Indian subcontinent was home to the urban Indus Valley Civilisation of the 3rd millennium BCE. In the following millennium, the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism began to be composed. Social stratification, based on caste, emerged in the first millennium BCE, and Buddhism and Jainism arose. Early political consolidations took place under the Maurya and Gupta empires; later peninsular Middle Kingdoms influenced cultures as far as Southeast Asia. In the medieval era, Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Christianity, and Islam arrived, and Sikhism emerged, all adding to the region's diverse culture. Much of the north fell to the Delhi Sultanate; the south was united under the Vijayanagara Empire. The economy expanded in the 17th century in the Mughal Empire. In the mid-18th century, the subcontinent came under British East India Company rule, and in the mid-19th under British Crown rule. A nationalist movement emerged in the late 19th century, which later, under Mahatma Gandhi, was noted for nonviolent resistance and led to India's independence in 1947.

So, he had a new suit, with a card pinned with his name and address and made the trip alone, by bus, to New Orleans. Several things occurred that kept me awake the whole night. First, the footfalls, the noise of my father running up and down the stairs, breathing heavily, I had to see what he was up to. So I hid and watched. There was a Christmas tree and the fireplace downstairs. Moreover, I could see my father. He was crawling around under the tree arranging a pyramid of packages. I felt dizzy, for what I saw forced me to reconsider everything. If these were presents intended for me, then obviously they had not been ordered by the Lord and delivered by Santa Claus; no, they were gifts bought and wrapped by my father. Which meant that my rotten little cousin Billy Bob and other rotten kids like him weren't lying when they laughed at me and told me there was no Santa Claus.

Fox has decided to ditch its untitled Patricia Hearst biopic after she denounced the project. “Twentieth Century Fox Film and its production partners have decided to cancel the studio’s planned project based on the book ‘American Heiress,'” a spokesperson for the studio said. The move came a few hours after Hearst had issued a strong denunciation of both the Fox movie biopic and a CNN documentary series about her 1974 kidnapping. She blasted author Jeffrey Toobin, whose unauthorized 2016 biography “American Heiress: The Wild Saga of the Kidnapping, Crimes and Trial of Patty Hearst” was being turned into the feature film and who is an executive producer of CNN’s “The Radical Story of Patty Hearst.” “Jeffery Toobin’s unauthorized book, ‘American Heiress,’ which cites one of my kidnappers as its main source, romanticizes my rape and torture and calls my abduction a ‘rollicking adventure,’” she said in a statement released by her daughter Lydia Hearst’s spokesperson. The move also comes less than a month after Disney reached a deal to buy the movie studio and other 21st Century Fox assets as part of a 52 billion transaction. Related Leah Remini to Star in Rob McElhenney, Rob Rosell Fox Comedy Pilot TV Ratings: Gordon Ramsay Carries Fox to Wednesday Win James Mangold was attached to direct the untitled adaptation of Toobin’s best-selling book about Hearst’s 1974 kidnapping by the Symbionese Liberation Army, and re-emergence as a bank robber and member of the left-wing terrorist group. Hearst captured the world’s attention when she was caught on tape participating in armed bank robberies and declared her allegiance to the SLA. Her arrest and trial sparked a media frenzy. Hearst, who claimed she was brainwashed, was captured after 18 months on the run and served 22 months in prison. Yahya Abdul-Mateen was cast this week as the SLA leader Donald DeFreeze, who was also known as Cinque Mtume and Field Marshal Cinque. DeFreeze and five other SLA members died in May of 1974, following a shootout with the Los Angeles Police Department. The six-part CNN original series, “The Radical Story of Patty Hearst,” is set for Feb. 11 and includes interviews with Bill Harris, who was part of the SLA, and Steven Weed, who witnessed the abduction. CNN’s planned weekly podcast, “Patty Has a Gun: The Life and Crimes of Patricia Hearst,” is set to be co-hosted by Toobin and CNN’s Brian Stelter, starting Jan. 26 on iTunes. ||||| Patricia Hearst, the heiress whose kidnapping became one of the most storied crimes of the 1970s, has issued a lengthy statement harshly denouncing upcoming film and TV projects based on her ordeal, and says she was inspired to do so by the MeToo movement and the Time’s Up presence at the Golden Globe Awards ceremony. She had especially strong words for author Jeffrey Toobin, whose unauthorized biography American Heiress is being turned into the feature film and who is an executive producer of the CNN docuseries The Radical Story of Patty Hearst. “I am further saddened and appalled that Fox 2000 agreed to finance and produce a movie based on Toobin’s book (with a similarly themed screenplay, also written by men) and that CNN has agreed to continue to perpetuate a one-sided dialogue romanticizing my torture and rape by hosting a podcast and docuseries through Toobin’s distorted lens,” said Hearst in a statement released by her daughter Lydia Hearst’s spokesperson. The untitled James Mangold-directed film, based on Toobin’s book, is set to star Elle Fanning and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II. The CNN original series, The Radical Story of Patty Hearst, is set to debut Sunday, Feb. 11 with two back-to-back episodes at 9 p.m. and 10 p.m. ET/PT. According to CNN, the six-part docuseries “follows the transformation of Patty Hearst from heiress to terrorist in a saga of privilege, celebrity, politics, media, revolution, and violence. Over 40 years later, newly discovered evidence, archival footage, cinematic recreations and exclusive firsthand accounts shed light on one of the biggest and most bizarre stories in modern American history.” The docuseries, CNN has said, includes unprecedented access to key figures in the story including Bill Harris, the man that abducted Hearst from her apartment in 1974 and Steven Weed, the fiancé who witnessed it all: “The series weaves through her upbringing, kidnapping, transformation into a terrorist, subsequent arrest and trial, and her transition back into American royalty.” Toobin (The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story) serves as one of the series’ executive producers.

The hour-long series is set to air over three consecutive weeks with two back-to-back episodes airing Sundays at 9 p.m. and 10 p.m. ET/PT on CNN. Here is Hearst’s statement in full: This past weekend at the Golden Globes so many strong women put together an incredibly moving testimony to the fact that times are changing. I’m so grateful for people like Reese Witherspoon, America Ferrera, and Eva Longoria who have taken a stand for women everywhere. When Oprah gave her acceptance speech it moved so many of us…she said, “[Recy] lived as we all have lived, too many years in a culture broken by brutally powerful men. For too long, women have not been heard or believed if they dared to speak their truth to the power of those men, but their time is up.” That hit home for me more than you can imagine. It’s no secret that I was abducted, raped, and tortured at 19. What followed was a series of events that were the direct result of a child having been destroyed both inside and out. Over the years I have been approached many times to discuss my ordeal, and I have answered many questions. I have spoken the truth about my experience and even wrote a 499-page book where I lay it all out, as painful as it was to relive. Each time I do, it puts me back in the nightmare which, as you might imagine, is deeply painful. This is why for the last several years, I have declined to answer any more questions. It’s very hard on me, and not something I want my daughters to be reminded of. When approached by Jeffrey Toobin in what could only be construed as an incredibly arrogant and egotistical fashion, he stated in an email that I should talk to him, saying, “you’ve written your own book and given many interviews”, yet he continued with, “It would be in your best interest to talk to me. I’m a high profile writer. This book will get a lot of attention. It will be seen as the last word on the subject.” It was offensive to me that a man would have the audacity to tell a woman that he would have the last word on her trauma. Naturally, I declined his request. Jeffery Toobin’s unauthorized book, American Heiress, which cites one of my kidnappers as its main source, romanticizes my rape and torture and calls my abduction a “rollicking adventure.” This project is attempting to rewrite history and directly flies in the face of the present #MeToo movement where so much progress is being made in regard to listening, and providing a voice, to those who have suffered abuse. I am further saddened and appalled that Fox 2000 agreed to finance and produce a movie based on Toobin’s book (with a similarly themed screenplay, also written by men) and that CNN has agreed to continue to perpetuate a one-sided dialogue romanticizing my torture and rape by hosting a podcast and docuseries through Toobin’s distorted lens. I refuse to give Jeffrey Toobin, 21st Century Fox, CNN or anyone else involved in these projects about my life the power to make me a victim again, or the power to provide a platform where victim blaming is ok. As hard as it was to do, I have grown well past the 19-year old me and gone on to become a proud wife, mother, and grandmother. I have no interest in revisiting such a violent and hurtful time in my life. Aren’t we living in a better world than this? I sincerely hope the answer is a resounding “Yes.” I am joyful and inspired by all of the women who have been brave enough to come forward with their truths. I stand with you, I support you, and I applaud you. #ListenToWomen #TIMESUP #MeToo – Patricia Hearst Neither CNN nor Fox 2000 had immediate comment. ||||| New CNN Original Series, “The Radical Story of Patty Hearst,” Premieres Sunday, Feb. 11 NEW YORK, Jan. 4, 2018 – The new CNN Original Series, The Radical Story of Patty Hearst, will debut Sunday, Feb. 11 with two back-to-back episodes at 9 p.m. and 10 p.m. ET/PT.

The book was also an inspiration for the previously announced Fox film. In her statement, Hearst said Toobin’s book “romanticizes my rape and torture and calls my abduction a ‘rollicking adventure.’ “ “This project is attempting to rewrite history and directly flies in the face of the present #MeToo movement where so much progress is being made in regard to listening, and providing a voice, to those who have suffered abuse,” Hearst said. In response, Twentieth Century Fox Film issued a statement saying they “have decided to cancel the studio’s planned project based on the book American Heiress.” No explanation was given. Hearst, the granddaughter of media mogul William Randolph Hearst, was kidnapped on Feb. 4, 1974, from her Berkeley apartment in the middle of the night by members of the Symbionese Liberation Army, a homegrown anti-government terrorist group. She later claimed in recordings released to the media that she’d developed an affinity for the group mission while taken hostage, but then renounced her captors after she was arrested 19 months later and charged for her role in a bank robbery carried out by its members. She was convicted and served 22 months in prison. Her sentence was commuted by President Jimmy Carter, and she was later pardoned by President Bill Clinton. She said the “incredibly moving testimony” of women such as Reese Witherspoon and Oprah Winfrey at the recent Golden Globes awards show compelled her to speak out now against those whose efforts would “make me a victim again.” Patty Hearst in 1974 Bettmann/Getty • Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

The answer is:","completion":"Title: The Heart's Lighthouse Genre: Drama/Romance Setting: A small coastal village in Maine. Plot: Act 1: Introducing the Characters and Challenges Sara, a hardworking and independent young woman, returns to her family's village in Maine after finishing her degree and to care for her ailing father. Grady, a strong and stoic lighthouse keeper with a heartbreaking past, protects the coast from the treacherous seascapes, harboring dreams of finding his soulmate in this peaceful paradise. The village holds a secret, a treasure believed to grant eternal happiness, but deeply hidden from prying eyes. Their paths cross as they both become inadvertently involved in the search for this mysterious treasure. Sara and Grady find themselves drawn to each other, exploring the beautiful shores and landscapes of their beloved village. Despite Grady's initial reluctance to open up, the two slowly build trust and eventually fall in love. The village celebrates their newfound love as a testament to the magic of the place. Act 2: The Big Reveal One evening, while Sara and Grady are out for dinner, she presents an envelope with a beautiful sonogram image inside. Her eyes fill with tears as she gently utters the words, \\"Grady, I'm pregnant.\\" Grady's world screeches to a halt, his mind racing between shock, confusion, and disbelief. In the heat of the moment, Grady walks away from Sara, leaving her heartbroken and alone. He retreats to the safety of the lighthouse, contemplating the magnitude of this revelation. Slowly, the unsettling memories of his past and a previous miscarriage with a former lover start to surface. Act 3: Grady's Trepidation Over the next few weeks, Grady distances himself from Sara, grappling with the pain resurfacing from his past, and the fear of losing a child again. As Sara's pregnancy progresses, she continues the search for the village's elusive treasure, hoping to find both happiness for herself and a way to rekindle the relationship with Grady. Meanwhile, Grady's inner conflict leads to several sleepless nights contemplating whether he can handle fatherhood and the responsibility of a family. Grady's closest friend, Jack, shares his own experiences of fatherhood and love, speaking to the importance of overcoming one's fears in order to embrace true happiness. Act 4: The Climax As the village gears up for its annual festival, news of an impending storm reaches the events committee, instilling widespread panic amongst the villagers. Grady, aware of the dangers to both the coast and village, prepares the lighthouse for the storm, while Sara and the others take shelter. Back at the lighthouse, Grady experiences an epiphany while gazing at the fierce waves - he must face his fears and be the protector that both the village and his family need. Just as the storm begins to ease, Grady spots a tiny boat in the distance, with Sara on board, eager to find the treasure that could save their relationship. Grady swiftly sails out on a rescue mission, braving the furious seas, and bringing Sara back to the safety of the lighthouse. In the dim light of the lighthouse, amid the raging storm, Grady finally breaks down and admits his fears, ultimately accepting his fate as a soon-to-be father. He promises to be there for Sara and their unborn child. Act 5: The Resolution With the storm subsiding, a glimmer of sunlight pierces through the clouds to reveal a hidden cove that the villagers had never ventured into before. Sara and Grady, along with the villagers, explore the newfound location and ultimately find the legendary treasure. As the village rejoices, Sara realizes that the treasure was not the answer to her happiness – true happiness lies in the love she shares with Grady and the family they're creating together. The film ends with Sara and Grady's hearts full of hope and anticipation, holding each other at the top of the lighthouse, overlooking the vast expanse of the ocean as they wait to welcome their new family member – together."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: This will prevent you from wasting time rearranging it. Decide which decorations you want to use, where they will go, and what direction you want the guests to follow. Imagine yourself starting at the beginning of the table, picking up a plate, dishing up an appetizer and a salad, and then moving down to the main course dish. Think about the order that you would eat a meal in, and arrange the food dishes in that order. It needs to be visible, but not in people’s way. If you have a lot of guests and your room is large, set the table away from any walls so that your guests have access to the table from both sides. If the room is smaller, place the table against a wall, out of the way. If possible, leave space for people to stand on either end of the table to avoid too much crowding in the front. Either of these will create a lovely base for the buffet table, and can mask a table that you may not want to be shown. If you use a table runner, position it in the center of the table and make sure that it runs the full length of the table. Plates are the first thing your guests will need, so they should be at the beginning of the table. Set out more plates than you think you’ll need, since guests often take a new plate each time that they return to the table. Having the utensils at the end of the table relieves people from having to hold them while trying to hold their plate and serve themselves food. With only two hands, that can be a difficult task! You can also have utensils at both the beginning and the end of the table, if you would prefer. Provide all of the utensils that will be needed for the food you’re serving. For example, don’t forget the soup spoons if you’re serving soup! Wrapping the utensils can make it easier for your guests to grab the whole bundle at once, instead of having to pick up each utensil individually. Since hungry people can be very eager to get what they need and sit down, it is best to have multiple stacks of plates, cups, utensils, and napkins. That way, many people can grab one at the same time without needing to wait in a line or push into each other. This step is often missed but is very important. If a guest needs to grab another napkin or adjust something, you want them to have space to set their plate down for a moment. When arranging your table, try to leave small pockets of space where a plate could fit. This will help you to visualize the end result and see if anything needs to be adjusted. Make sure that the table isn’t too crowded, and that your decorations aren’t going to block any food. Do a trial walk down the buffet table as well, pretending to serve yourself. Make sure that everything is placed logically and within reach. At this stage, adjust anything that needs to be fixed and remove any decorations that are cumbersome or unattractive.","completion":"To set up a nice table for a party, first think about where to put the table, close to a wall or in the middle of the room. Imagine how you and your friends would walk around the table and get food. Put plates at the beginning and extra things, like forks, at the end. Make sure there's enough room for everyone to get what they need without waiting in a long line. Leave a little space for people to put their plates down if they need to.

Hasina Ganchi was given the all-clear after a CT scan last July, but in August she suffered a brain haemorrhage. A mother-of-four suffered a brain haemorrhage after doctors gave her the all-clear when part of her brain scan results went missing. Royal Blackburn Hospital has apologised to Hasina Ganchi, admitting it is 'likely' a correct diagnosis would have prevented the 42-year-old's haemorrhage. The hospital wrote to Mrs Ganchi blaming a 'computer failure' for mistake, telling her a section of her CT scan had been unavailable to doctors considering her case. Otherwise, it said, radiologists would have been able to see she had a brain aneurysm. Mrs Ganchi, from Blackburn, had suffered headaches for more than a decade, prompting doctors to send her for a scan at the hospital in July last year. She was told the results were 'okay', but in August Mrs Ganchi collapsed while working at the family-owned takeaway. Mrs Ganchi, who is married to Noor, said: 'I have had headaches for 10 to 12 years but I was never referred to the hospital for an X-ray or anything. 'The medication kept going up and up and they said it was all sorts of things, such as depression.' Following her scan on July 5, she said she was given the all-clear. 'Then in August, I was at the shop and I had a dizzy spell,' she said. 'The people around said I was falling and they grabbed me.' Mrs Ganchi was taken to Royal Preston Hospital where scans showed she had had an aneurysm - a swelling of blood within an artery or vein. An official complaint was lodged against Royal Blackburn and Mrs Ganchi and her family met with hospital bosses earlier this month. She said: 'We wanted to keep a record of everything said in the meeting so we asked for them to record it and send us a copy. 'But when they sent the CD, it was blank. It just added insult to injury.' The Royal Blackburn Hospital has apologised to Mrs Ganchi, admitting it is 'likely' a correct diagnosis would have been made if a 'computer error' had not resulted in part of her brain scan going missing and being unavailable to doctors assessing her case. Mrs Ganchi said she was still suffering severe headaches, but the cause has never been diagnosed. She said: 'I can’t do things that I used to do and I am not myself. I sometimes wish I had just died when I had the haemorrhage.' In a letter sent after that meeting, radiology manager David O’Brien said after Mrs Ganchi’s first scan, it was decided a second scan with an injection of dye was needed and undertaken. 'While it is not possible to say with absolute certainty whether or not identifying the aneurysm earlier would have prevented you (Mrs Ganchi) suffering the haemorrhage, this is a likely possibility' - Radiology manager David O'Brien of the Royal Blackburn Hospital. However because of the computer problems, the findings of the second scan were not placed on her report. He said: 'When you had a further scan in August the radiologist referred back to your previous examination and noted that images demonstrated a 4mm aneurysm in the middle cerebral artery. 'While it is not possible to say with absolute certainty whether or not identifying the aneurysm earlier would have prevented you suffering the haemorrhage, this is a likely possibility. 'Please accept my sincere apologies on behalf of the directorate and indeed the trust for this system failure and for any additional suffering and anguish it may have caused.' He added that new procedures had been put in place to prevent similar incidents happening again. Chris Pearson, chief nurse at East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust, said: 'Patient confidentiality is of the utmost importance to us so we are unable to comment on individual cases.'

The reviewer presented several points of dissatisfaction throughout his or her review, starting with the unavailability of some of their preferred dishes like the salmon, prime rib, short ribs, and New York strip. Being out of so many options could have set a negative tone from the very beginning, as it suggests poor preparation or management by the restaurant. The critique then extended to the quality and presentation of the food that was available: the fish and chips were evidently disappointing, likening the fish to a \\"cold brick\\" not only indicates it was potentially undercooked or not fresh, but it also implies poor taste and texture. The comparison of the fries to those at Burger King suggests the reviewer perceived them as generic and potentially overprocessed, which may not align with expectations of a potentially higher-end dining environment. The complaint about the pie sampler presentation shift from a 'cute wooden carrier' to merely being 'plopped [onto] a plate' indicates a decline in the restaurant’s attention to detail, as well as a potentially poorer overall dining experience. It suggests a possible decline in quality or effort put into the presentation, which, in turn, can significantly impact the customer's dining experience. The reviewer also raised the issue of time and cost efficiency, implying that the entire experience was not worth the two hours spent or the 500 cost for eight people to eat. This suggests that the restaurant failed to provide value for the money spent, which is a major factor in overall customer satisfaction. Finally, the last statement \\"Go somewhere else.\\" is a clear recommendation against visiting the restaurant. It's a strong negative sentiment and shows the overall dissatisfaction and disappointment of the reviewer. Therefore, based on these points, the sentiment of this review is decidedly negative as the reviewer had a distinctly unsatisfactory experience, covering various aspects including the availability of dishes, quality and presentation of food, time and cost efficiency, and overall perceived value for money."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We have the equation: 136 * u + 179 - 1690 = 1073. 1. First, let's get rid of that pesky -1690. We simply add 1690 to both sides of the equation to balance it out: 136 * u + 179 = 1073 + 1690. 2.

Defiant: Shaun Wright, pictured with Ed Miliband in 2012, was working 'as normal' on Thursday despite increasing public pressure to resign. David Cameron added his weight to the growing demands for Rotherham’s crime tsar to quit his £85,000-a-year role in the wake of the child exploitation scandal. In an unequivocal statement, the Prime Minister said that Shaun Wright should ‘resign and take full responsibility for what happened’. But Mr Wright, the police and crime commissioner for South Yorkshire, was still clinging to his job last night. He continued to work ‘as normal’ even while protesters gathered outside his office and his deputy quit, calling for him to do the same. Tracey Cheetham had been under little public pressure to go. However, the mother-of-three decided she could no longer carry on amid the outrage over Mr Wright’s defiant stand. She said: ‘It is vital for people to have confidence in the office of police and crime commissioner and, with this in mind, I believe it would have been the right thing for Shaun Wright to resign. 'This has become even more apparent given the overwhelming opinion of the public – as they are the people to whom the commissioner is ultimately accountable. ‘I am incredibly sad that this issue has become centred on one person and we seem to have lost focus on the most important factor in all this – the 1,400 victims who were failed.’ Mrs Cheetham, who earned £45,000 as Mr Wright’s number two, criticised the ‘political point-scoring’ and instead called for more to be done to bring the criminals to justice. One Rotherham victim, who was abused at 14 by an older man, told the Mail that Mr Wright ‘should be ashamed of himself’. Jessica, now 29, said: ‘The more he holds on to his job, the harder it will be for victims to move forward. ‘He needs to accept his part in it and quit.’ Mr Wright, who was a member of the Labour party until he quit on Wednesday and has met Ed Miliband, cannot be sacked by the police or by politicians because he was elected by the public in 2012. Police commissioners can only be removed from office at the polling booths or if they have committed a serious crime. Local crime boards are able to suspend PCCs if they are charged with an offence that carries a maximum sentence of more than two years. They can then be sacked if they are convicted. Labour backbencher John Mann, who has called for an outside police force to investigate the Rotherham scandal, said such arrangements were ‘absurd’.‘The police commissioner roles are ridiculous,’ he said. ‘They should be scrapped.’ Resignation: Tracey Cheetham, deputy police and crime commissioner for South Yorkshire (right), resigned from her post on Thursday. Mr Cameron said that Mr Wright should 'resign and take full responsibility' Mr Mann wrote a letter to Home Secretary Theresa May calling for Mr Wright to be investigated for ‘wilful neglect of duty’. In his letter, he wrote: ‘The report by Alexis Jay OBE states in great detail that during his time as the portfolio holder responsible for children’s services Shaun Wright received three separate reports concerning child abuse and failed to act on them. It is clear that as a democratically elected councillor with the specific responsibility for children’s services Shaun Wright failed to act despite three separate warnings. ‘Not only did Shaun Wright fail to act, he failed to inform other members of his own party of the serious problems of young girls being abused, raped and beaten on a systematic basis.’ Mr Mann’s letter added: ‘It is my view that the facts provided in the Alexis Jay report provide evidence of the potential for wilful neglect of duty by public officials, including the current South Yorkshire police and crime commissioner Shaun Wright. ‘I look forward to an appropriate police investigation to determine whether such an offence has been committed and if so by whom.’ There was no sign of Mr Wright either at his home or at his office in Barnsley yesterday.

Answer a question about this article: Genetics compression algorithms are the latest generation of lossless algorithms that compress data (typically sequences of nucleotides) using both conventional compression algorithms and genetic algorithms adapted to the specific datatype. In 2012, a team of scientists from Johns Hopkins University published a genetic compression algorithm that does not use a reference genome for compression. HAPZIPPER was tailored for HapMap data and achieves over 20-fold compression (95% reduction in file size), providing 2- to 4-fold better compression and in much faster time than the leading general-purpose compression utilities. For this, Chanda, Elhaik, and Bader introduced MAF based encoding (MAFE), which reduces the heterogeneity of the dataset by sorting SNPs by their minor allele frequency, thus homogenizing the dataset. Other algorithms in 2009 and 2013 (DNAZip and GenomeZip) have compression ratios of up to 1200-fold—allowing 6 billion basepair diploid human genomes to be stored in 2.5 megabytes (relative to a reference genome or averaged over many genomes).

Background: Jesse Donald Knotts was born in Morgantown, West Virginia, the youngest of four sons born to farmer William Jesse Knotts and his wife, Elsie Luzetta Knotts (nee Moore). His parents were married in Spraggs, Pennsylvania. His English paternal ancestors immigrated to America in the 17th century, originally settling in Queen Anne's County, Maryland. Knotts' brothers were named Willis, William, and Ralph. Context: Before he entered high school, Knotts began performing as a ventriloquist and comedian at various church and school functions. After high school, he traveled to New York City to try to make his way as a comedian, but returned home to attend West Virginia University when his career failed to take off. After his college freshman year, Knotts joined the United States Army and spent most of his service entertaining troops. He toured the Pacific Islands as a comedian as part of a G.I. variety show called Stars and Gripes. His ventriloquist act included a dummy named Danny \\"Hooch\\" Matador. In a TV Guide interview in the 1970s, he said that he had grown tired of playing straight man for a hunk of wood when he was in the Army. According to Knotts, he tossed the dummy overboard off a ship in the South Pacific. He swore that he could hear the dummy calling for help as the ship sailed on, leaving him bobbing helplessly in the waves. Knotts served in the United States Army from June 21, 1943 to January 6, 1946. Discharged in the rank of Technician Grade 5, which was the equivalent of a Corporal. During his military service, Knotts was awarded the World War II Victory Medal, Philippine Liberation Medal, Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal (with 4 bronze service stars), Army Good Conduct Medal, Marksman Badge (with a Carbine BAR) and Honorable Service Lapel Pin. Knotts returned to West Virginia University after being demobilized and graduated in 1948. He married and moved back to New York, where connections he had made while in the Special Services Branch helped him break into show business. In addition to doing stand-up comedy at clubs, he appeared on the radio, eventually playing the wisecracking, know-it-all character \\"Windy Wales\\" on a radio western called \\"Bobby Benson and the B-Bar-B Riders\\". Knotts got his first major break on television in the soap opera Search for Tomorrow where he appeared from 1953 to 1955. He came to fame in 1956 on Steve Allen's variety show, as part of Allen's repertory company, most notably in Allen's mock \\"Man in the Street\\" interviews, always as an extremely nervous man. He remained with the Allen program through the 1959-1960 season. From October 20, 1955 through September 14, 1957, Knotts appeared in the Broadway version of No Time for Sergeants, in which he played two roles, listed on the playbill as a Corporal Manual Dexterity and a Preacher. In 1958, Knotts appeared for the first time on film with Andy Griffith in the film version of No Time for Sergeants. In that film, Knotts reprises his Broadway role and plays a high-strung Air Force test administrator whose routine is disrupted by the hijinks of a provincial new recruit.

Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: What was the name of the place that absorbed Crewe and Alsager College of Higher Education?, using the article: There are three universities in the City of Manchester. The University of Manchester, Manchester Metropolitan University and Royal Northern College of Music. The University of Manchester is the largest full-time non-collegiate university in the United Kingdom and was created in 2004 by the merger of Victoria University of Manchester founded in 1904 and UMIST, founded in 1956, though the university's logo appears to claim it was established in 1824. It includes the Manchester Business School, which offered the first MBA course in the UK in 1965. Manchester Metropolitan University was formed as Manchester Polytechnic on the merger of three colleges in 1970. It gained university status in 1992, and in the same year absorbed Crewe and Alsager College of Higher Education in South Cheshire. The University of Law, the largest provider of vocation legal training in Europe, has a campus in the city.The three Universities are grouped around Oxford Road on the southern side of the city centre, which forms Europe's largest urban higher education precinct. Together they have a combined population of 76,025 students in higher education as of 2015, although almost 6,000 of them were based at Manchester Metropolitan University's campuses at Crewe and Alsager in Cheshire.One of Manchester's most notable secondary schools is the Manchester Grammar School. Established in 1515, as a free grammar school next to what is now the Cathedral, it moved in 1931 to Old Hall Lane in Fallowfield, south Manchester, to accommodate the growing student body. In the post-war period, it was a direct grant grammar school (i.e. partially state funded), but it reverted to independent status in 1976 after abolition of the direct-grant system. Its previous premises are now used by Chetham's School of Music. There are three schools nearby: William Hulme's Grammar School, Withington Girls' School and Manchester High School for Girls.

Photograph: Alan Porritt/AAP The results are in: Tony Abbott will be Australia's 28th prime minister. It's a resounding Coalition win, leaving Labor facing a heavy defeat. The latest counts are still unfolding, but currently standing at 47.32% for the Australian Labor Party and 52.68% for the Coalition. From Guardian Australia's political editor Lenore Taylor: The nationwide swing of just over 3% against the ALP with more than half the vote counted, disguised huge variations around the nation, with 10% swings in the island state of Tasmania, and a 4.5% swing in Victoria. But much smaller swings were being recorded in the Labor leader, Kevin Rudd's home state of Queensland, where Labor's vote held up much better than anticipated and mining billionaire Clive Palmer attracted 11% of the primary vote with a well-financed campaign for his Palmer United party, with preferences apparently flowing back to Labor. Labor appears likely to lose between 10 and 20 seats, a sizeable defeat but not quite the wipeout that most strategists, and nationwide opinion polls, had predicted.

Tony Abbott, the leader of the Coalition, emerged victorious and became the 28th prime minister of Australia, resulting in a resounding defeat for the Australian Labor Party (ALP). According to the latest counts mentioned in the article, the ALP secured 47.32% of the votes, while the Coalition received 52.68%. The article highlights the nationwide swing of just over 3% against the ALP. The swing was uneven, with variations across the nation, such as a massive 10% swing in Tasmania and a 4.5% swing in Victoria. However, in the Labor leader Kevin Rudd's home state of Queensland, the party's vote held up better than expected. The article also notes the influence of mining billionaire Clive Palmer, whose Palmer United party attracted 11% of the primary vote. The preferences of this party apparently flowed back to the Labor party, helping offset some of the losses. The losses for Labor ranged between 10 and 20 seats, which points to a significant defeat, albeit not as large as some strategists and nationwide opinion polls had predicted.

Article: With the development of society and economy, animals and their habitats are getting pushed aside as households decrease in size and increase in number. Small numbers of people per household on average use more energy and goods per person. Greater numbers of households require more natural resources for construction. The possible result of this problem may be _ natural resources to meet consumer demand without endangering habitats important to biodiversity. Personal freedom and social choice may come at huge environmental cost. Direct costs include visible damage to animal habitats and plant life. Indirect costs include the release of more greenhouse gases. The effects of such \\"personal freedom and social choice\\" have already surfaced in south-west China's Wolong Nature Reserve. In Wolong, they found that a reduced average household size was directly tied to an increase in homes, and thus an increase in the amount of firewood consumed for cooking and heating. The rise in wood fuel use has contributed to disappearance of forests and to the loss of habitats for giant pandas. Curious about whether other parts of the world were experiencing similar phenomena, they got the support of a team of researchers including Stanford's Paul Ehrlich, well-known for his population studies, to find out the household dynamics in 141 countries between 1985 and 2000. Their study proved that the difficult choice of Wolong is part of a global trend. In the 76 countries considered biodiversity \\"hotspots\\", such as the United States, Brazil, Australia, and Kenya, the number of households grew by 3.1% every year, while the population increased just 1.8%. Meanwhile, the number of people per home dropped from 4.7 to 4.0. The decline in household size has resulted in 155 million additional households in hotspot countries, almost always limiting biodiversity. In the 10 non-hotspot countries -- those without high-density areas of animal and plant species -- similar results were found, though on a lesser scale. Even in countries experiencing...

When we break down the meanings of each sentence, we can understand the essential differences between them. 1. Ignatius Bonomi began his training in the office of architect Prosser (1787-1870) in Durham. In this sentence, we learn that Ignatius Bonomi, an individual who would later become an architect himself, started his architectural training under someone named Prosser. Prosser is an architect who lived from 1787 to 1870, and his office was located in Durham. In this context, Prosser is portrayed as a more experienced architect who served as a mentor for Ignatius Bonomi during the early stages of Bonomi's career. 2. Prosser began his training in the office of the architect Ignatius Bonomi (1787-1870) in Durham. In the second sentence, the roles are reversed. Here, it is Prosser who starts his architectural training under Ignatius Bonomi, who is already an established architect during the mentioned time period and has an office in Durham. In this situation, Ignatius Bonomi is assumed to be the mentor, while Prosser is a mentee learning from him. To summarize, the key difference between the two sentences is the role each individual plays in the context of their architectural training. In the first sentence, Ignatius Bonomi is the architectural student mentored by Prosser, while in the second sentence, Prosser is the architectural student mentored by Ignatius Bonomi. Although both sentences shed light on the professional relationship between Ignatius Bonomi and Prosser at the beginning of their careers, they each present that information in a distinct way, making the meanings different."},{"prompt":"Q:Generate a question that has the following answer: A syringe for the following movie plot: Like other governments, in 1945 the United States has set up a \\"Division\\" to secretly experiment on people with psychic abilities, hoping to build a powerful psychic army.

I created a blog called A Year of Reading the World and put out an appeal for suggestions of titles that I could read in English. The response was amazing. People all over the world were getting in touch with me, offering ideas and book lists. Some posted me books from their home countries. In addition, several writers, like Turkmenistan's Ak Welsapar and Panama's Juan David Morgan, sent me unpublished translations of their novels, giving me a rare opportunity to read works unavailable in Britain. Even with such an extraordinary team of bibliophiles behind me, however, sourcing books was no easy task.

Stir in an acid, such as lemon juice or white vinegar, to curdle the milk. You'll need about 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of acid per 1 quart (946 ml) of milk. Stir the milk gently after adding the acid and let it sit for approximately 15 minutes. During this time, the curds will start to separate from the whey. Prepare a cheesecloth-lined colander. While the milk is curdling, prepare a cheesecloth-lined colander. Dampen the cheesecloth and fold it so that it is at least two or three layers thick when covering the colander. Position the colander over a large bowl or the sink to catch the whey that drains from the curds. Strain the curds. After the milk has curdled, carefully pour the mixture into the cheesecloth-lined colander to catch the curds. Let the curds strain for a couple of minutes, allowing the whey to fully drain away. Gently lift and move the cheesecloth around to promote even draining. Rinse and drain the curds. Once the whey has mostly drained away, rinse the curds gently with cold water to rinse off any remaining whey and to cool the curds down. Be careful not to disturb the structure of the curds too much during this process. Allow the curds to drain again for a few more minutes until most of the water has passed through the cheesecloth. Season the cottage cheese. Transfer the curds to a mixing bowl, and gently break them apart with a fork or your fingers. Now is the time to add seasonings, such as salt, to taste. You may also add herbs and spices for additional flavor, depending on your preferences. Mix the seasonings in gently, being mindful not to overwork the curds. Storing and serving.

Summarize this article: The exact weight you should start with depends on how much weight-training experience you have and the size and weight of your body. The more experience you have lifting weights, the heavier kettlebell you can start with. Even if you’re an experienced weightlifter, you may want to start with a lighter kettlebell until you get used to exercising with it. Regular cast iron kettlebells have bigger handles that you can grab onto with 2 hands, which is helpful when you first start exercising with them. Avoid using competition kettlebells, which have smaller handles that can only be gripped with 1 hand. It’s important that you know how to grip a kettlebell correctly so you don’t injure yourself. There are a variety of ways you can hold a kettlebell, and the grip you should use depends on the exercise you’re doing. Some common grips are: Single-handed grip: Wrap your fingers around the handle on the kettlebell so your palm is facing in toward your body. Double-handed grip: The same as a single-handed grip, but with both hands. Goblet: Hold the kettlebell at your chest so each of your hands is gripping a side of the handle. Keep your elbows tucked in at your sides. Racked: Grip the kettlebell with 1 hand and hold it up near your chest so the bulk of the kettlebell is resting on your forearm. Tuck your elbow in at your side. If you’re new to using kettlebells, you’ll want to perfect your form before you move on to heavier weights. Start by practicing kettlebell exercises with light weights. When you get the form down and you feel confident with the motions, then you can progress to heavier weights. Stand up with your feet shoulder width apart, holding the kettlebell in one hand. Move the kettle bell from hand to hand in a circle around your body, while keeping your core as stable as possible. Start slow with a light kettlebell to get used to changing hands. You may drop your kettlebell a few times as you get used to the motion. Aim for 4 sets of 20 reps each.","completion":"The ideal starting weight for kettlebell training depends on your previous weight-training experience and your body's size and weight. Experienced weightlifters can begin with a heavier kettlebell, but it's recommended to start with a lighter one until you become comfortable with the exercises. For beginners, regular cast iron kettlebells with larger handles are suggested, as they allow for a two-handed grip. It's best to avoid competition kettlebells with smaller handles designed for one-handed grips. Proper gripping technique is crucial to prevent injuries during kettlebell exercises. Various grips, such as single-handed, double-handed, goblet, and racked, are used depending on the specific workout. In a single-handed grip, wrap your fingers around the handle with your palm facing inward. The double-handed grip involves both hands wrapped around the handle in the same manner. The goblet grip requires holding the kettlebell at chest level with each hand gripping a side of the handle and elbows tucked in. Lastly, the racked grip entails holding the kettlebell with one hand near the chest, resting its bulk on your forearm while tucking the elbow in. For kettlebell newcomers, it's vital to perfect your form before increasing weight. Begin by practicing exercises with light weights, progressively moving to heavier ones as you gain confidence and master the correct form. A basic exercise to start with is standing with your feet shoulder-width apart and holding the kettlebell in one hand. Then, move the kettlebell in a circle around your body, passing from one hand to the other while maintaining core stability. Begin with a light kettlebell and gradually increase the speed as you become more comfortable with changing hands. Expect to drop the kettlebell a few times while getting used to the motion.

In order to do so, he leaves the classroom with two beakers filled with the same type of gas. He goes to the kitchen and heats one beaker up on the stove, but does nothing to the other beaker. He then returns to the classroom and has the students examine the gases. The students observe that the kinetic in beaker G is higher than that of the gas in beaker R. Which beaker did the teacher place on the stove? Answer:","completion":"The teacher placed beaker G on the stove. The observations made by the students indicate that the kinetic energy of the gas in beaker G is higher than that of the gas in beaker R. This difference in kinetic energy can be attributed to the heating process that one of the beakers underwent, which in this case was beaker G. When a gas is heated, its molecules become more energetic due to the increase in temperature. This results in the molecules moving faster and colliding more frequently with each other as well as with the walls of the container. The energy of motion of the molecules is referred to as kinetic energy. As the temperature of a gas increases, its kinetic energy also increases. In the given scenario, beaker G was heated in the kitchen, causing the gas molecules within it to absorb thermal energy. This led to an increase in the velocity of the gas molecules, consequently resulting in a higher kinetic energy. Conversely, beaker R was left unheated, so its gas molecules maintained their initial level of energy. Upon returning to the classroom, the students were able to observe this difference in kinetic energy between the two beakers. Since the gas in beaker G exhibited higher kinetic energy, it can be concluded that beaker G was the one heated by the teacher on the stove. This demonstration effectively helped the students to understand the relationship between the heating of a gas and the increase in its kinetic energy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write highlights for this article: British detectives hunting for missing Madeleine McCann are looking for two German-speaking men whose computer-generated images will be broadcast on special TV appeals this week. Scotland Yard says the un-identified men were seen in the Portuguese resort of Praia da Luz at the time when Madeleine, then aged three, went missing on May 3, 2007. Witnesses told Portuguese police who originally investigated the case that they saw two German-speaking men at the resort that day, but little or no importance was placed on them at the time. Now British detectives are keen to trace the two individuals to establish if they are connected to Madeleine’s disappearance or to eliminate them from the investigation, a Scotland Yard spokesman said. Scroll down for video. Moving: The McCanns during their Crimewatch interview to be broadcast tomorrow. They say they are hopeful. Fateful: The reconstruction will show Maddie's last game of tennis with her father before she went missing in 2007. It will also show the moment she was taken from her holiday bed in Praia da Luz in Portugal six years ago. The E-Fit (Electronic Facial Identification Technique) images of individuals based on eyewitness reports will be broadcast on Crimewatch on BBC1 at 9pm. Similar appeals will be made on Dutch programme Opsporing Verzocht (Investigation Required) on Tuesday night, and on the German version of Crimewatch, Aktenzeichen XY . . . Ungelost (Case Files XY . . . Unsolved) on Wednesday night, as Madeleine’s parents make an international appeal for information. Kate and Gerry McCann, both 45, will fly to Munich on Wednesday to make a live appeal from the studios of Aktenzeichen, which is watched by five million viewers. A spokesman for the German programme said: ‘The reviewing and analysis of all available information has led to new insights and leads that, for the first time, point to Germany. Aktenzeichen shows the photofits of two men, who apparently spoke German, and to whom little or no importance was previously attached.’ The McCanns previously visited Germany in 2007 to make an appeal because a high number of German tourists were in the Algarve region when Madeleine went missing. Missing: Maddie with her younger siblings, twins Sean and Amelie, who are now eight. The latest mugshots will also be shown on Dutch TV as the two ‘German speakers’ may have been talking Dutch, as the two languages are often confused, said a police source in the Netherlands. Tomorrow’s Crimewatch programme will feature a dramatic reconstruction of the moment Madeleine went missing, giving the most detailed sequence of events ever made public that led to her disappearance from the holiday apartment where she was sleeping. The reconstruction – which includes Mr McCann’s 6pm tennis lesson when Madeleine acted as ballgirl – will be accompanied by a moving interview by presenter Kirsty Young with Kate and Gerry McCann. They talk about how much they miss Madeleine, who would be ten today. They will make a live appeal for members of the public to come forward with information. In a statement, the McCanns said: ‘We are greatly encouraged by new information coming to light, with the pieces of the jigsaw now fitting together. Kate and Gerry McCann will fly to Munich on Wednesday to make a live appeal on TV to five million viewers. The tennis match reconstruction is based on this image, which Maddie's parents distributed in a bid to find her. ‘We are really hopeful that the appeal on Crimewatch will bring further evidence which will take us a step closer to finding Madeleine.’ The Met refused to comment on whether the two men they were looking for were German-speakers, but a family friend said that detectives were on the ‘brink of a breakthrough’. The Met officer leading the investigation, Detective Inspector Andy Redwood, will make a live appeal for information on the programme. This image was released of what Maddie might look like now. The McCanns said they feel a step closer. Since Scotland Yard began reviewing the case in 2011, detectives have interviewed 442 people in 30 different countries and have drawn up a list of 41 potential suspects. Officers are pursuing 4,920 lines of inquiry, of which 2,123 had been ‘completed’.’ Detectives now believe that their ‘timeline’ holds the key to discovering what happened to Madeleine. Det Insp Redwood said: ‘Our work has significantly changed the accepted version of events and it has allowed us to highlight very specific appeal points. ‘I hope that when the public see our investigative strands drawn together, it will bring in new information that moves our investigation forward.’ Highlights:","completion":"1.

King was born in Long Beach, California, into a conservative Methodist family, the daughter of Betty (nee Jerman), a housewife, and Bill Moffitt, a firefighter. Billie Jean's family was athletic. Her mother excelled at swimming, her father played basketball, baseball and ran track. Her younger brother, Randy Moffitt, became a Major League Baseball pitcher, pitching for 12 years in the major leagues for the San Francisco Giants, Houston Astros, and Toronto Blue Jays. When the open era began, King campaigned for equal prize money in the men's and women's games. In 1971, with ideas for the formation of an eight player women's group from her husband, Larry King, financial backing of World Tennis magazine founder, Gladys Heldman, and the sponsorship of Virginia Slims Chairman Joe Coleman, King became the first woman athlete to earn over US100,000 in prize money; however, inequalities continued. King won the US Open in 1972 but received US15,000 less than the men's champion Ilie Nastase. She stated that she would not play the next year if the prize money were not equal. In 1973, the US Open became the first major tournament to offer equal prize money for men and women. King led player efforts to support the first professional women's tennis tour in the 1970s called the Virginia Slims, founded by Gladys Heldman and funded by Joseph Cullman of Philip Morris. Once the tour took flight, King worked tirelessly to promote it even though many of the other top players were not supportive. \\"For three years we had two tours and because of their governments [Martina] Navratilova and Olga Morozova had to play the other tour. Chris [Evert], Margaret [Court], Virginia [Wade], they let us do the pioneering work and they weren't very nice to us. If you go back and look at the old quotes; they played for the love of the game, we played for the money. When we got backing and money, we were all playing together - I wonder why? I tried not to get upset with them. Forgiveness is important. Our job was to have one voice and win them over.\\" In 1973, King became the first President of the women's players union - the Women's Tennis Association. In 1974, she, with husband Larry King and Jim Jorgensen, founded womenSports magazine and started the Women's Sports Foundation. Also in 1974, World TeamTennis began, founded by Larry King, Dennis Murphy, Frank Barman and Jordan Kaiser. She became league commissioner in 1982 and major owner in 1984. King is a member of the Board of Honorary Trustees for the Sports Museum of America, which opened in 2008. The museum is the home of the Billie Jean King International Women's Sports Center, a comprehensive women's sports hall of fame and exhibit. did it ever become equal pay for her?","completion":"Yes, Billie Jean King's efforts to achieve equal pay for male and female tennis players were ultimately successful. As mentioned earlier, in 1973, the US Open became the first major tournament to offer equal prize money for men and women, which was a significant milestone in the fight for pay equality in tennis. King was the driving force behind the push for equal pay, using her influence and leadership to advocate for fair compensation regardless of gender. King's work for pay equality extended beyond just the US Open. In 1973, she also played the infamous \\"Battle of the Sexes\\" match against Bobby Riggs. This exhibition match was a landmark event in the fight for gender equality in sports, as King defeated Riggs in front of millions of spectators, proving that women could compete at the highest levels of the sport. In the years that followed, King's activism continued to inspire change in the world of professional tennis. In 2007, Wimbledon, the last of the four Grand Slam tournaments to adopt equal prize money, finally announced that they would offer equal pay to both male and female players. This decision marked a pivotal moment in the fight for pay equality in sports, largely thanks to the tireless efforts of Billie Jean King. Throughout her career and after her retirement, King has remained an influential advocate for gender equality in sports. Her activism has had a lasting impact not just on tennis but also on the broader athletic landscape, paving the way for future generations of female athletes to be fairly compensated for their talent and dedication."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Process: - You take a tray - Add water into the tray - You insert the tray into a freezer - The water molecules begin to slow down - The water becomes ice - The ice cubes are ready. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less water in the tray put into a freezer happens, how will it affect MORE ice cubes being made. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"Based on the provided process, yes, the supposed perturbation of having less water in the tray definitely has a direct effect on the process. Let's break down step by step: 1. When you take a tray and add water, the amount of water you add directly determines the number of ice cubes that can be made. The more water, the more ice cubes that can be made and vice versa. 2. As you insert the tray into the freezer, the cooling process begins which will transform the water into ice. 3. The slowing down of water molecules is indeed the fundamental aspect of water turning into ice but this is not directly related to the volume of water present. It is more of a fundamental physical property of how water turns into ice. 4. When the water becomes ice, the amount of ice formed directly depends on the amount of water you initially added to the tray. 5. Thus, when the ice cubes are ready, if you had put less water in the tray, there will be fewer ice cubes. In conclusion: The perturbation of reducing the water quantity in the tray will directly affect the total number of ice cubes that can be made. This is because the total volume of ice is directly proportional to the initial volume of water. Thus lesser the water in the tray, the fewer ice cubes produced. This is a direct effect."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

After a run-in with the police in which the smugglers manage to get away by faking a boat explosion resulting in the police motorboats responding to the false emergency allowing the smugglers to get away, Luca and his brother Mickey suspect Scherino (Ferdinand Murolo), the head of a rival gang of smugglers, of passing on their actives. Lucia and Mickey take their accusations to their boss Perlante (Saverio Marconi) a sleazy playboy withy numerous Mafia connections, who agrees to look into it. After a nighttime fire at Mickey's racing stables kills a valued racehorse, he and Luca drive over to inspect the damage. But on the way, they are stopped at a fake police roadblock where the assasins dressed as policemen trick Mickey into getting out of the car and machine-gun him to death over and over again (think Sonny Corlone's death scene in 'The Godfather'), while Luca barely escapes injury by hiding on the floor of the car.Afterwards, Perlante suggests that Luca leave town for a few days, but he refuses.

In 2009, to highlight the severe global warming crisis and bring attention to the rapidly melting Himalayan glaciers, the government of Nepal organized a unique and highly symbolic event – a cabinet meeting on Mount Kalapatthar, overlooking Mount Everest. This unprecedented meeting took place on December 4, 2009, at an altitude of 5,250 meters (17,192 feet) above sea level. The event was attended by the then Prime Minister of Nepal, Madhav Kumar Nepal, along with over two dozen ministers and members of the government. The meeting lasted about 20 minutes, during which the cabinet passed a declaration emphasizing the urgent need for an ambitious climate agreement at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, which was just a few days away.

Write an article based on this summary: – With school threats, shootings, and lockdowns in the news at a dizzying pace, educators are naturally looking at ways to keep kids safe. But while those measures typically include security guards or metal detectors, one Alabama middle school is raising more than a few eyebrows by asking parents to arm their children—with canned goods. As WHNT tells it, WF Burns Middle School Principal Priscella Holley recently sent home a letter that began, \\"We realize at first this may seem odd,\\" and went on to contend that a well-chucked can \\"could stun the intruder or even knock him out until the police arrive. The canned food item will give the students a sense of empowerment to protect themselves and will make them feel secure.\\" Parents are asked to give their child an 8-ounce can (\\"corn, beans, peas, etc.\\") to bring to school. An administrator tells CNN that the canned-peas defense is part of ALICE (Alert, Lockdown, Inform, Counter, and Evacuate) training it implements \\"to get kids evacuated and not be sitting ducks hiding under desks.\\" She tells WJBF that the school has seen some \\"negativity\\" in response \\"out there on Facebook,\\" and that it's \\"the very, very last resort and the very, very smallest part of this entire training.\\" Wonkette runs through a list of ideas it deems much worse, before concluding, \\"In other words, chucking cans of creamed corn at an intruder is starting to sound pretty damned reasonable.\\" (Schools in South Carolina might take a different approach.) Article:","completion":"Title: Alabama Middle School's Unique Approach to Enhance Student Safety - A Canned Defense Introduction At a time when school threats, shootings, and lockdowns are constantly making headlines, educators and parents are becoming increasingly concerned about keeping children safe at school. Various measures have been taken to ensure school security, including the addition of security guards and the installment of metal detectors. Interestingly, a middle school in Alabama has taken an unconventional approach by asking parents to arm their children with canned goods as a form of self-defense. This article will discuss the rationale behind this method, the ALICE training program implemented by the school, the reactions from the community, and the effectiveness of this approach as a means of keeping students safe. Canned Goods as Self Defense WF Burns Middle School's principal, Priscella Holley, sent home a letter informing parents of the school's initiative to arm students with canned goods as a method of protecting themselves in case of an emergency situation. According to the letter, these canned goods could potentially stun an intruder or even knock them out until the police arrive. Suggested cans to bring include 8-ounce ones containing corn, beans, or peas, and parents have been asked to provide these items for their children. Holley argues that having a canned food item will enable students to feel a sense of empowerment and security while they are at school. The ALICE Training Program This canned-goods defense is part of a larger training program called ALICE (Alert, Lockdown, Inform, Counter, and Evacuate), which aims to help students evacuate from a dangerous situation and not be sitting ducks hiding under desks. The canned defense is considered a last-resort technique and makes up a small part of the training. The idea is that instead of simply waiting for an intruder to enter a classroom, students will be armed with a tool that could potentially save their lives. Community Reactions and Criticisms The school's decision to incorporate canned food items as a means of self-defense has sparked mixed reactions among the community, with negative comments circulating on Facebook. However, others deem the idea reasonable as long as it is considered as the very last resort and other more considerable measures are undertaken in order to ensure safety. Effectiveness of the Canned Defense Approach While the effectiveness of using canned goods as a defense tool has not yet been scientifically proven, the concept of empowering students to take action in an emergency situation is supported by some experts. This new method is prompting educators and parents to think outside the box in order to keep children safe. It remains to be seen if the canned defense will become a widely-used tactic in schools nationwide or if it will remain a unique approach adopted by WF Burns Middle School. Conclusion Addressing concerns about school safety is a top priority for educators and parents alike. WF Burns Middle School's unconventional canned defense approach challenges the traditional norms and encourages a proactive response in case of an emergency. The effectiveness of this method as a means of self-defense is debatable. Still, it is evident that innovative ideas and new approaches are needed to ensure students' safety and security in the face of increasing threats to schools."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After ensuring that the ice tray is evenly and appropriately filled with cold water, it must be placed in the freezer. When placing the tray in the freezer, it's important to handle it with care to prevent water from spilling. It is usually most useful to put it on a flat, steady surface inside the freezer. Once the tray has been securely placed, the next and final step of the process is to close the freezer door. Closing the door is crucial as it ensures that the interior of the freezer maintains a low temperature. It is this low temperature that causes the water in the ice tray to freeze, thereby forming ice cubes. Without closing the door, the freezer would not be able to keep its interior cold enough, and the water in the tray would not solidify. Therefore, the process of ice cube formation would be incomplete. This could also impact the efficiency and electricity consumption of the freezer as it would have to work harder to try and keep the temperature down. Apart from maintaining the right conditions for freezing, closing the freezer door also prevents the entry of warm air, unwanted odors, or even contaminants that could affect the ice or other contents of the freezer. Furthermore, it contributes to the safe and effective operation of the freezer unit. Thus, closing the freezer door is an essential final step in the process of making ice cubes using an ice tray. It concludes the manual part of the process and allows the freezer to perform its function of freezing the water into ice cubes. After this, the process of ice formation is purely a waiting game - you let the freezer do its job until the water freezes solid, at which point the ice is ready for use."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The Queen and both families are said to be \\"delighted with the news\\". As with her previous two pregnancies, the duchess, 35, is suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum, or severe morning sickness. She pulled out of an engagement at the Hornsey Road Children's Centre in London, which had been planned for Monday afternoon. Catherine is being cared for at Kensington Palace, the statement said. The duke and duchess have a son, George, who is four, and a daughter, Charlotte, aged two. With the previous two pregnancies, the couple announced them before the 12-week mark - when most women have their first scan - because of the duchess being unwell with hyperemesis gravidarum. Her first pregnancy was revealed when she was just a few weeks pregnant with Prince George after she was admitted to hospital in December 2012.

Hyperemesis gravidarum affects about one in every 200 pregnancies and results in severe nausea and vomiting - with one of the main dangers being dehydration. 'Shaping future of monarchy' Image copyright PA By Peter Hunt, BBC royal correspondent Once again Prince William and his wife - who are very focused on being in control - have been thwarted. And once again, it's due to circumstances outside their control. The couple have been forced to make the announcement at a time not of their choosing - and while the duchess is still in the early stages of her pregnancy - because she is suffering from very acute morning sickness. They were poised to take on more royal duties. They are now preparing to welcome another addition to their family. An addition that will attract considerable global interest. The child's grandmother is the late Diana, Princess of Wales. This princess or prince is unlikely to be crowned monarch. As things stand, that future awaits their brother, Prince George. So there is no constitutional significance to the birth next year. But an ancient institution that already appears pretty secure has just been further buttressed. The three Cambridge siblings will fashion the future of the British monarchy well into the 21st Century.

A change - which stops royal sons taking precedence over their female siblings in the line of succession - came into force in March 2015. The child will be the Queen's sixth great-grandchild. The last third-born monarch Image copyright Reuters To become King or Queen as the third-born royal child is rare - and has yet to happen within the current House of Windsor. But the third child of George III and Queen Charlotte, William IV, took on the task and ruled from 1830 to 1837. The Hanoverian king acceded to the throne aged 64 when his older brother, George IV, died without an heir. He became next in line when he was 62 and his other older brother, Frederick, Duke of York, died. Arriving in Manchester for a royal visit, Prince Harry - who will drop to sixth in line to the throne when the child is born - said the news was \\"fantastic\\" and he was \\"very, very happy\\".

Kensington... (Associated Press) LONDON (AP) — Prince William and his wife, the Duchess of Cambridge, are expecting their third child, Kensington Palace said Monday. Kensington Palace made the pregnancy announcement as they said that the former Kate Middleton was not feeling well enough to attend an engagement later in the day. As with her other two pregnancies, the duchess is suffering from Hyperemesis Gravidarum, or acute morning sickness. \\"The queen and members of both families are delighted with the news,\\" the palace said in a statement. Kate is being cared for at her Kensington Palace home in London. William and Kate, both 35, already have two children: Prince George, 4, and Princess Charlotte, 2. No details were immediately available about when the third baby is due. The royals have said from the time of their engagement that they wanted to have a family — the only question was how many children they wished for. Royal watchers recorded every aside for clues as to what the plans might be. When asked on a royal tour in Singapore in 2012 about how many children he wanted, William said he was \\"thinking about having two.\\" More recently, during a royal tour of Poland, Kate joked about a third child when given a cuddly toy designed to soothe tiny babies. Kate thanked the well-wisher for the present and turned to William. \\"We will just have to have more babies,\\" she said laughing.

Hoping to rebound from their first loss of the season to the Steelers, the Vikings flew to Lambeau Field for the highly anticipated Week 8 divisional rematch with the Green Bay Packers, as quarterback Brett Favre made his return to his former team. In the first quarter, the Packers scored the game's first points as kicker Mason Crosby made a 37-yard field goal following a miscue by Vikings center John Sullivan (Favre audibled for another play but Sullivan snapped the ball before Favre completed his audible). Minnesota responded with a 1-yard touchdown from running back Adrian Peterson. In the second quarter, the Vikings added onto their lead as Favre completed a 12-yard touchdown pass to tight end Visanthe Shiancoe, followed by kicker Ryan Longwell (another former Packer) nailing a 41-yard field goal. Minnesota picked up where they left off in the third quarter as Favre hooked up with rookie wide receiver Percy Harvin on a 51-yard touchdown pass, yet Green Bay started to rally as Crosby booted a 26-yard field goal, followed by quarterback Aaron Rodgers finding tight end Spencer Havner on a 16-yard and a 5-yard touchdown pass. The Vikings answered in the fourth quarter with Favre connecting with tight end/fullback Jeff Dugan on a 2-yard touchdown pass. The Packers tried to come back as Rodgers completed a 10-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Greg Jennings (with a failed 2-point conversion), but Minnesota pulled away with Favre finding wide receiver Bernard Berrian on a 16-yard touchdown pass.

Last updated at 9:58 AM on 15th December 2011. Miner: Foreman Trevor Steeples was overcome by methane gas while 2,300ft underground at Daw Mill in June 2006. A judge today ordered Britain’s biggest mining firm to pay £1.2 million in fines and costs after he heard how four miners died following safety breaches in four separate incidents. UK Coal admitted offences under health and safety laws in relation to the deaths of Trevor Steeples, Paul Hunt, Anthony Garrigan and Paul Milner. Mr Steeples, Mr Hunt and Mr Garrigan died following incidents at Daw Mill colliery, near Coventry in 2006 and 2007. Mr Milner died after an incident at the now-closed Welbeck Colliery, in Nottinghamshire, in 2007. Mr Justice MacDuff said at Sheffield Crown Court he would not impose a penalty so high it would cripple a company suffering real financial problems. He said UK Coal would be fined £112,500 in relation to each incident and would pay a further £187,500 in costs in each case. But he urged the families of the dead men to focus on the total combined financial penalty for the firm. The judge said: 'These were, of course, dreadful accidents. They were preventable accidents. 'However, unlike most criminal acts, there was no intention to kill or injure. 'But the law rightly demands a high duty of care by employers for the safety of their employees and other workers. 'Mining is and will remain a dangerous occupation. These accidents all occurred in the depths of the earth.' Safety breaches: Mr Steeples, Mr Hunt and Mr Garrigan died following incidents at Daw Mill colliery pictured. 'This is not easy work - neither in conception nor in execution. But safety is paramount in the modern world. 'Long gone are the days of 60 and more years ago, when men were allowed to die and suffer dreadful injury in pursuit of profits for coal owners.' Prosecutor Rex Tedd told an earlier. hearing that the miners were in the habit of riding the train rather. than taking a long walk to the coal face but management did nothing to. stop the practice. He said: 'The practice continued. because there was no practical alternative given the gruelling nature of. the journey which otherwise had to be done on foot.' The judge today told the court: 'In each. of the cases the death would have been prevented if proper safe systems. of working had been in place - and if those systems had been enforced.' Bob Leeming, HM Inspector of Mines, left said there had been 16 deaths in pits in the last five-and-a-half years and right Andrew Mackintosh, UK Coal's director of communications. But he added: 'I am not sure that that is entirely true in respect of the death of Mr Steeples. In his case the major cause of death was dereliction of duty by a number of his colleagues who, unbeknown to senior management, unaccountably, and probably unforeseeably, failed in their duties.' Paul Hunt, 45, a contractor, of Swadlingcote, Derbyshire died after falling off an underground train at Daw Mill. He was riding on the leading car facing backwards as it reached the surface following the one-in-four climb. The driver nearly stalled the train then put on speed which jolted the cars throwing off Mr Hunt. 'He was dislodged and fell to the track and was struck by the train with tragic results,' said Rex Tedd, prosecuting. Trevor Steeples, 46, a foreman, was overcome by methane gas while 2,300ft underground at Daw Mill in June, 2006. Anthony Garrigan, 42, of Thorne, near Doncaster was killed at Daw Mill when he was trapped under a 100-tonne rock fall. Changes had been made to the roof of a tunnel and short support bolts used which put stress on the sides. Previous rock falls had been reported but the information was not passed to the Mining Inspectorate until the tragedy. Two months before his death, a miner received deep cuts to his arm as he leaped clear of a fall. Mr Garrigan, a contractor, was due to operate a bulldozer but it was under repair so he was switched to a three-man team. The others were drilling when the rock fell and buried him. despite 'exceptional' rescue efforts he died. A fourth miner Paul Milner, 44, was fatally injured at Welbeck Colliery when a shaft gave way trapping him under a rock. Production on the seam had stopped and a salvaging operation was taking place after a new code of practice had been drawn up. Mr Tedd said the code, which provided for temporary roof supports, was 'ignored' on site. The judge said he had a difficult task as UK Coal was suffering financially and had seen its share price fall from £5 to 29p in the time since the accidents. He also said the firm had made a 'massive investment in safety measures' since new senior management took over. He said there had been an enormous improvement in the defendant’s safety record. The judge said: 'Coal mining used to be a part of the fabric of our society - particularly here in South Yorkshire. 'In spite of the privatisation of the mines and the closure of so many of them in recent years, coal is still needed. 'UK Coal is an important contributor to the economy of the United Kingdom. 'Coal mined within the defendant’s mines makes a significant contribution to the generation of the nation’s electricity.' He. said the company was 'trading on the edge of viability'. He said: 'It. would be in no one’s interest if the company ceased to trade or if it. had to reduce further the scope of its operations.' Anne. Steeples the mother of Trevor Steeples said after the hearing:. 'Our. family are relieved that UK Coal has been fined over the tragic deaths. of four men but are bitterly disappointed at the outcome of the trial. regarding Trevor’s death. 'Somebody was to blame. We know who they are and they will have to live with this knowledge for the rest of their lives.' During. sentencing the judge remarked that the cause of Mr Steeples’ death was. 'dereliction of duty' by a 'number of his colleagues who unbeknown to. senior management unaccountably and probably unforseeably failed in. their duties. 'One of those fellow workmen made false recordings of oxygen and methane levels upon which reliance was placed. 'These dishonestly recorded that he had taken readings when he had not. 'I. know that he lost his job as a consequence. Another fellow workman a. ventilation officer who had all the approriate training and. qualifications negligently authorised the use of of a fan which far from. improving matters was in fact positioned so as to prevent the. circulation of fresh air. Safety breaches: Mr Steeples, Mr Hunt and Mr Garrigan died following incidents at Daw Mill colliery pictured. 'This was a major contributor to the asphyxiating conditions in which the the unfortunate Mr Steeles found himself.' In respect of the other three deaths the judge said risk were taken, codes of practice not enforced and safe systems of working were either 'not in place or were not followed',. Bob Leeming, HM Inspector of Mines said afterwards: 'We are concerned about safety in pits. 'Over the last five-and-a-half years there have been 16 fatalities whereas before Trevor’s death there was only one in five years. 'The series of fatal accidents we have had have caused us great concern and we are putting pressure on the industry to reverse that trend.

Plaid warned of a claw-back of powers. Mr Cairns said the Great Repeal Bill would not see decisions taken away from the devolved bodies. He reiterated that the UK government would temporarily hold on to powers for EU laws in areas like agriculture while discussions between the UK and devolved governments continue post-Brexit. The proposal was set out by the UK government in its Great Repeal Bill, which proposes to transport EU laws to the UK statute book. Opposition politicians from Labour, Plaid Cymru and the SNP raised concerns that devolution could be undermined by such a move. The Shadow Welsh Secretary Christina Rees called for extra powers for the Joint Ministerial Council (JMC) to ensure that the Great Repeal Bill does not \\"in any way re-write or override devolution as set out in the recent Government of Wales Act\\". The JMC is a group of senior ministers from the UK and devolved administrations. The Plaid Cymru MP for Dwyfor Meirionnydd Liz Saville Roberts said that the UK government was planning to \\"claw-back devolution powers\\". Mr Cairns said that the Great Repeal Bill proposals would not see any decisions currently taken by the Welsh Government \\"removed from them.\\" \\"We expect that repatriation of powers from the European Union will extend the powers of the WG significantly, but of course there is a process to work through in order to provide the stability and certainty that industry needs,\\" said Mr Cairns.

Options: -Put the phone in an air plane to block/stop ads.. -Put the phone in air plane mode to block/stop ads..","completion":"The goal is to keep ads off your phone when playing a game. It is important to understand the motive behind this goal, which is to have an uninterrupted and ad-free gaming experience on your mobile device. Among the provided options, putting the phone in an air plane would not make any sense because it is an unrealistic method that does not directly address the problem at hand. However, putting the phone in airplane mode is a feasible approach to block/stop ads during gameplay. Let's dive deeper into how airplane mode can be an effective solution as well as explore other ways to achieve the goal of keeping ads off your phone when playing a game: 1. Putting the phone in airplane mode: When your phone is set to airplane mode, it will disable any connectivity options such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and mobile data. Most in-game ads are served through the internet. By disabling the connections, your mobile device won't load or display any ads while playing games. This method may work best for games that do not require a constant internet connection to function. However, do remember that some games might not run without an active internet connection, and enabling airplane mode may restrict their functionality. 2. Purchase the premium version: Some games offer a premium or ad-free version that removes any in-game advertisements once you pay a one-time fee or subscribe to a monthly plan. If the game you are playing has this option, it might be worthwhile to consider purchasing it if you appreciate the game and want to support the developers while also enjoying an ad-free experience. 3. Use an ad-blocker app: There are ad-blocking apps available for download on various app stores. These apps work to prevent ads from being displayed on your mobile device while you are using it, including during gameplay. While it's essential to be cautious about any third-party apps due to potential security or compatibility issues, reliable ad-blockers can offer a smooth, ad-free gaming experience. 4. Play offline or download the game locally: Some games can be downloaded on your device and played offline, which means they do not require an internet connection. By playing games offline, you will inherently limit the chances of ads appearing on your screen since most ads rely on an internet connection. Ensure that the specific game you are interested in has an offline mode before attempting this method. 5. Turn off personalized ads: Some smartphones allow users to opt-out of receiving personalized ads in their settings. Changing this setting may reduce the number of ads you receive or provide less intrusive ads on your phone, which may make them more tolerable during gameplay. In conclusion, putting the phone in airplane mode is a \\"quick fix\\" if you want to block/stop ads on your phone while playing games, but this method may limit the functionality of certain games that require a continuous internet connection. Additional strategies, such as purchasing the premium version, using ad-blockers, or playing offline games, are other alternatives that could be more viable for achieving an ad-free gaming experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Addison dedicated Tracy's journal to the service as a way of preserving a deep part of history. Given the context: What will Tracy want to do next? Possible answers: flinch about details, run away from attention, help historians out The answer is:","completion":"Tracy will most likely want to help historians out. Since Addison dedicated Tracy's journal to the service as a way of preserving a deep part of history, it is evident that the journal holds significant details pertinent to a particular era or event. Tracy's interest in preserving this history suggests a keen sense of responsibility and a desire to contribute to a better understanding of the past. One of the critical responsibilities of historians is to analyze and interpret historical documents and artifacts to gain insights into the past. By offering Tracy's journal to the service, it demonstrates Tracy's understanding of the importance of preserving history. In addition, the decision to share something as personal as a journal with the public indicates a willingness to put aside any personal apprehensions for the greater good. As an individual who recognizes the importance of the role history plays in shaping our present and future, Tracy will likely want to continue helping historians by providing additional context, firsthand accounts, and any other relevant information that can supplement their understanding of the journal. Tracy might also become involved with historical societies or institutions, working alongside historians to promote the significance of the journal and the events it documents. Moreover, Tracy might feel the need to participate in public discussions, lectures, or conferences to address any misconceptions or discrepancies that may arise in interpreting the historical content of the journal. It is crucial to consider the nuances and subtleties of the language, as well as any cultural elements that might influence the understanding and interpretation of the journal's content. In the process of assisting historians, Tracy might actively participate in promoting the preservation of other historical documents, artifacts, and sites. This collaboration could manifest in volunteering at museums, supporting fundraising efforts, or participating in campaigns to raise awareness of the importance of historical preservation. In summary, given Tracy's evident desire to preserve and share a deep part of history, it is most likely that Tracy will choose to help historians out in their research efforts. This collaboration may take various forms, such as providing additional context or details relating to the journal's content, engaging with historians to scrutinize the historical nuances of the journal, or even participating more broadly in the promotion and protection of other historical artifacts and sites. By doing so, Tracy not only contributes to the understanding and appreciation of the past but also helps shape a more informed and enlightened future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: I love charity shops and so do lots of other people in Britain because you find quite a few of them on every high street. The charity shop is a British institution, selling everything from clothes to electric goods, all at very good prices. You can get things you won't find in the shops anymore. The thing I like best about them is that your money is going to a good cause and not into the pockets of profit-driven companies, and you are not damaging the planet, but finding a new home for unwanted goods. The first charity shop was opened in 1947 by Oxfam. The famous charity's appeal to aid postwar Greece had been so successful that it had been flooded with donations. They decided to set up a shop to sell some of these donations to raise money for that appeal. Now there are over 7,000 charity shops in the UK. My favorite charity shop in my hometown is the Red Cross shop, where I always find children's books, all 10 or 20 pence each. Most of the people working in the charity shops are volunteers, although there is often a manager who gets paid. Over 90% of the goods in the charity shops are donated by the public. Every morning you see bags of unwanted items outside the front of shops, although they don't encourage this, rather ask people to bring things in when the shop is open. The shops have very low running costs, and all profits go to charity work. Charity shops raise more than PS110 million a year, funding medical research, overseas aid, supporting sick and poor children, homeless and disabled people, and much more.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: No doubt you already have a good idea of what temperature is. You might say that it’s how warm or cool something feels. In physics, temperature is defined as the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. When particles of matter move more quickly, they have more kinetic energy, so their temperature is higher. With a higher temperature, matter feels warmer. When particles move more slowly, they have less kinetic energy on average, so their temperature is lower. With a lower temperature, matter feels cooler. Now, I have a new situation: Noah is currently making dinner in his kitchen. He has been boiling some soup on the stove for a while, so the temperature of the soup is currently high. Noah's brother, Justin, is sitting on the couch in the living room. Justin is eating ice cream, which has a low temperature. Answer this question please: Do the particles have more kinetic energy in the ice cream or in the soup? Answer:","completion":"The particles have more kinetic energy in the soup. Justification: In the given background information, it is mentioned that temperature is defined as the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. When particles move more quickly, they have more kinetic energy, and the temperature is higher. Conversely, when particles move more slowly, they have less kinetic energy, and the temperature is lower. In the described situation, Noah has been boiling soup on the stove, which indicates that the temperature of the soup is high.

Rob Preece. PUBLISHED:. 13:37 EST, 22 June 2012. |. UPDATED:. 13:37 EST, 22 June 2012. A former teacher has revealed how she leapt from a cliff edge to save her 19-month-old son after he fell over the side as they chased butterflies. Melanie Liu feared the worst when she saw her youngest son Eli slip off the edge as they enjoyed a picnic at a beauty spot in Whitby, North Yorkshire. The cliff has a drop of some 65 feet to a concrete car park, but luckily Eli was unhurt because he landed in a bush about 15 feet down. Safe and sound: Melanie Liu hugs her 19-month-old son Eli (left) after he survived falling off a cliff at Spion Kop in Whitby by landing in a bush (right) Ms Liu jumped down to him, breaking her fall slightly by grabbing grass and digging her nails into the cliff face. Ms Liu, 39, who runs a guest house with her husband Bill, 44, said the incident happened on Spion Kop in Whitby last Saturday. She said they had been following butterflies with her little lad at what she thought was a safe distance. But the thick grass and vegetation at the spot made it seem to her that they were two feet from the edge, when in fact they were much closer. Ms Liu, a mother of two, said she had a firm hand on the hood of Eli’s jacket but as the child took one more step towards the edge - a distance she thought was too close - he disappeared over the side. 'It was just the worst moment of my life, he somersaulted twice and landed on a shrub about 15 feet down,' she said. 'As he dropped I jumped, you just don’t think about it at the time. It was a maternal instinct. 'They say your whole life flashes before your eyes but it was his death that flashed before mine, I was afraid of what I would see when I found him. 'I know what was at the bottom of that cliff. It was a terrifying moment.' She said she stopped beside her son, who had started crying as soon as he landed in the bush. 'I grabbed him and laid for ages on that bush, she said. 'I was shaking that much it felt like hours but it was probably minutes. It is your worst fear. Terrified: Ms Liu said it was the worst moment of her life when Eli fell while chasing butterflies. 'I was saying \\"don’t move baby, stay still baby\\".' Despite wearing four-inch high-heeled boots, Ms Liu was able to bring Eli back to the top after a few minutes. 'Once we got to the top we lay down for a long time,' she said. 'After 10 minutes he was fine but I was in shock and started being sick and shaking. My heart was hammering. 'It was around five minutes from when Eli fell until I got him back to safety but it seemed like hours. 'There are only one or two of those shrubs on the side of the cliff. It is so lucky that he landed on one. 'As soon as Eli fell I started screaming and was still screaming when I jumped over the side but I hadn’t realised it. 'A man had been watching on another cliff and ran to get round to us. He told me that he had heard a bloodcurdling scream. 'I was bit incoherent but but he calmed me down.' Ms Liu said the man who helped her was called Tom and lived in Somerset but she had no more details. She warned other people to take care at the cliff edge but said the grass should remain overgrown for the wildlife. She said: 'I never once let go of him and thought nothing would happen but the edge is much closer than you think. 'It took me ages to get home. I kept being sick and bursting into tears on the way. 'I won’t be going near a cliff edge again with children, no way. 'I consider myself to be a safety-conscious mum, but look what happened.' Dramatic: The white spot marks the point from which Eli fell. The shrub broke his fall - and prevented him landing in a concrete car park some 50 feet further down.","completion":"1.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which type of oven had fewer instances of voltage pushing a huge amount of charge through the wires? Customers bought two types of electrical ovens, type A and type B. They were all happy at first but type B ovens started to short circuit. Hint: For example, if a circuit has a potential difference of 100 volts and it is intended for the circuit to contain a 100 ohm resistance, then the wires carrying the current for this circuit will be designed for 1.0 amp. If that 100 ohm resistance is suddenly cut out of the circuit and only 0.10 ohm resistance remains, then the voltage will push 1000 amps of current through the circuit. This current overheats the wires and may damage the circuits or start a fire in the walls or the appliance. There are many possible causes of a short circuit, one possible cause could be something overheating, melting wires, and thereby fusing the circuit closed, bypassing the resistance. Another cause might be something damaging the insulation of a wire, allowing the incoming and grounds wires to touch. In any case, once the resistance is lost, the voltage pushes a huge amount of charge through the wires causing them to overheat. A:","completion":"Type A ovens had fewer instances of voltage pushing a huge amount of charge through the wires. According to the provided paragraph, customers bought both type A and type B electrical ovens, but only type B ovens started to short circuit. Since short circuits result in a huge amount of charge being pushed through the wires, it is safe to conclude that type A ovens experienced this issue less frequently."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

You know how we pay for electricity, right? Well, just like that, the SoCal RLS Tariff is a special way of paying for electricity in Southern California. Now, let's talk about Peaking Rates. You know how sometimes we use more electricity during the day, like when it's really hot and we need to turn on the air conditioner? That's called a \\"peak time\\". So, during peak times, we have to pay a little more for electricity. That's why it's called \\"Peaking Rates\\". In this email, I want to share some important details about these rates and how they may affect us. I hope this explanation was helpful for you. If you have any questions, just let me know, and I'll be happy to help! Warm wishes, [Your Name]"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

However, it provides information about Bill Monroe's mandolin playing style, which has been influential in the history of the instrument. Bill Monroe, an American musician known as the \\"Father of Bluegrass,\\" was famous for his distinct mandolin playing techniques. Monroe's style had a significant impact on the way other musicians approached the mandolin in subsequent years. He played a Gibson F-5 mandolin, featuring four double-string courses and typically equipped with a set of eight strings. He popularized playing lead melodies similar to the fiddle style and incorporated percussive chording using the \\"chop\\" technique, which enabled him to produce a sharp sound by quickly striking and muting the strings. However, the development of the electric five-string mandolin is not attributed to Bill Monroe. The electric five-string mandolin, which has an additional high string to its standard eight-string counterpart, is a more recent innovation designed to extend the instrument's range and versatility. These instruments typically use magnetic pickups to amplify their sound, like electric guitars. Some of the people associated with the development and popularization of the electric five-string mandolin are Tiny Moore, Johnny Gimble, and Paul Glasse. These musicians helped pave the way for the modern five-string electric mandolin, which blends traditional bluegrass elements and contemporary music styles such as jazz and rock. It's important to note that the electric five-string mandolin is still not as widespread as the traditional four-course mandolin commonly used in bluegrass, classical music, and other genres. However, innovative musicians and luthiers continue to explore its possibilities and contribute to the evolution of the instrument. In summary, while Bill Monroe's playing style and techniques undoubtedly had a significant influence on the mandolin's history, he was not directly responsible for the development of the electric five-string mandolin."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

This one comes from Selina from Beautystorm. Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage: The severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots. The very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin. In order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment. After cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin. After gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What did the author say about the Australian sun? Options: A. something about it causing injury B. not enough information C. something about it being mild to skin D. something about it being harsh on the skin Answer:","completion":"D. something about it being harsh on the skin"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It was the subject of some meetings with ubuntu-women, something I have discussed with my friend Sulamita in a Brazilian bar at 4.30am and the subject of various ad-hoc discussions at the Ubuntu Developer Summit. As the wider Open Source community grows, it becomes more of an issue every day, and something we all need to be aware of. While in Brazil I made a promise to Sulamita that I would be blogging about the issue of discrimination against women, and I have been holding off writing an entry until I had some real, practical, implementable steps that I can advise people to take to help make the situation better. Although I will never fully understand how some women are made to feel at the hands of such discrimination, I have been hoping my contribution could be to help contribute to an awareness of the issue, and for that to happen I felt I needed to construct some doable steps that people can execute. Solving social problems is hard though, which ain’t all that surprising, so I had held off on a blog post until I had some such action points. I have since discovered that there is really one key step that we all need take – don’t accept or allow discrimination in your community. In my mind all discrimination is bad. Every day people get up and are discriminated due to gender, age, race, mobility, technical knowledge and more. The issues of discrimination, while different in the specifics (e.g. women are discriminated in different ways to age discrimination), the underlying issue is very similar – mistreating people because of a grouping they are part of. We have all suffered this in different ways, from serious racial hatred to someone not taking you seriously because you have long hair and an Iron Maiden t-shirt. When did they start thinking a lot about discrimination?

He is the 2010 Olympic champion, the 2009 World champion, a two-time (2005, 2007) Four Continents champion, the 2009 Grand Prix Final champion, and a two-time (2007, 2008) U.S. national champion. In the 2005-2006 season, Lysacek again competed on the Grand Prix. He placed second at the 2005 Skate America, but it was clear that his Grease free skate was not working. Lysacek and coach Frank Carroll made the decision to find a new long program. Lysacek's new Carmen program was a success at the 2005 NHK Trophy, where Lysacek placed second. Lysacek was the only American man to qualify for the 2005-2006 Grand Prix Final, but he withdrew before the event because of bursitis and tendinitis in his right hip. At the 2006 U.S. Championships, the de facto Olympic qualifier, Lysacek was third after the short program, but pulled up to win the free skate, finishing second overall. He was named to the 2006 Winter Olympic team along with Johnny Weir and Matthew Savoie. At the Olympics, following a 10th-place finish in the short program, Lysacek became sick with the stomach flu. Unable to practice, he stayed in bed at the Olympic village, receiving fluids from IVs. After considering withdrawing, he decided to skate the next day and went on to skate a career-best free skate. He finished his free skate with eight triple jumps and was ranked third of the night. He finished fourth overall, seven points below the bronze. He commentated on his free-skating program on Olympic Ice the next day with Scott Hamilton and Mary Carillo. Lysacek ended his season by winning the bronze medal at the 2006 World Championships in Calgary, Alberta. He was once again troubled by illness, having been administered three different antibiotics to fight a bacterial infection, which at one point, caused him to cough up blood. He rose from seventh place in the short to finish third on the strength of his free-skating program. After the World Championships, Lysacek toured with Champions on Ice as a full member of the cast. What else did he do?","completion":"Apart from the achievements mentioned in the article, Evan Lysacek had a remarkable career in figure skating and overcame numerous challenges throughout. Some of his other accomplishments include: 1. During the 2006-2007 season, Lysacek successfully defended his Skate America title and won the NHK Trophy. He also qualified for the 2006-2007 Grand Prix Final, where he placed fourth. 2. In 2007, he won his first U.S. National Championship with a significant margin over silver medalist Johnny Weir. Lysacek also won a gold medal at the Four Continents Championships in 2007, improving from his bronze-medal finish the previous year. 3. During the 2007-2008 season, Lysacek won the Cup of China and also won a bronze medal at the 2007 Skate America event. He qualified for the 2007-2008 Grand Prix Final and finished sixth. Lysacek went on to defend his U.S. National Championship title successfully in 2008. 4. In the 2008-2009 season, Lysacek placed first at Skate America and second at the Cup of China. He qualified for the 2008-2009 Grand Prix Final, where he won the gold medal. His outstanding performances during the season led him to win his first World Championship title in 2009. 5. Additionally, Lysacek toured with the Stars on Ice and Champions on Ice figure skating shows. He also participated in the popular TV show \\"Dancing with the Stars,\\" where he was partnered with professional dancer Anna Trebunskaya and eventually won the competition during its 10th season. In summary, Evan Lysacek had a prestigious and accomplished figure skating career that included multiple national and international titles, overcoming injuries and illness, and even branching out into other forms of entertainment such as skating tours and television appearances."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

These camps were established to accommodate the influx of new immigrants, mainly Jewish refugees who arrived in Israel with few or no possessions during the period following the establishment of the state. The large number of immigrants during this time led to a scarcity of resources, resulting in the Austerity Period, where basic necessities such as food, clothes, and furniture had to be rationed. To address the crisis and aid in the resettlement and integration of the refugees, Israel's first Prime Minister, David Ben-Gurion, signed a reparations agreement with West Germany in 1952. However, this decision led to mass protests from the Jewish population, who were angered and hurt by the idea that Israel would accept financial compensation for the Holocaust. The protesters felt that accepting money could not begin to address the immeasurable suffering and losses experienced by the Jewish people during the horrors of the Holocaust. Nevertheless, the reparations agreement provided Israel with much-needed funds to invest in housing and infrastructure, which ultimately helped absorb the large refugee population and improve their living conditions. Over time, most ma'abarot were dismantled as the residents were gradually moved to more permanent housing, and the camps eventually became part of Israel's history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Organization: Backpacks typically have compartments or pockets, so it's possible to keep the scissors separate from other items, preventing potential damage or accidents. 4. Protection: Backpacks provide a level of protection for the scissors, as they are enclosed and not exposed to external factors such as weather conditions. 5.

Step 1: Identify relevant information The premise mentions: 1. The colors of the outfit - black and grey. 2. Designed to echo a previous outfit. 3. No antique appearance. 4. Kept all the frills. Step 2: Define \\"practical\\" Practical clothes can be considered those that are functional, comfortable, and suitable for the purpose they are being worn for. Step 3: Analyze the information 1. Colors: Black and grey colors might be versatile and low-maintenance, which could be seen as practical. 2. Design: The design is meant to echo a previous outfit but not appear antique, which might not directly contribute to the practicality of the outfit, but it implies the designer considered style and wearability. 3. No antique appearance: This suggests that the clothes are modern or updated for current use, which could contribute to practicality. 4. Kept all the frills: Frills are decorative features that may not contribute directly to practicality and might even be seen as impractical in some cases. Step 4: Assess the hypothesis Considering the analyzed information, it's not possible to definitively conclude that \\"The clothes were practical.\\" While the colors and lack of antique appearance might contribute to practicality, the presence of the frills does not necessarily indicate practicality. Furthermore, there is not enough information on the material, durability, or comfort of the clothes which could impact practicality."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Step 1: Analyze the title The title says \\"I hate vince.\\" The word \\"hate\\" is a strong negative sentiment. This indicates that the reviewer has strong negative feelings toward Vince. Step 2: Analyze the review The review states, \\"I haven't seen the ppv but the 1997 story is confusing unless you know it.\\" This statement suggests that the user did not fully view or understand the content but found it confusing, which can be considered negative. The review continues with, \\"Bret is the greatest and I can never forgive vince for what he did.\\" This part of the review praises Bret, showing a positive sentiment towards Bret.

But, as I have said countless times before, I cannot allow this union to proceed without the consent and blessings of both families involved.

They could all present their arguments and reasons, and the council could then decide whether or not the union should proceed.\\" The speaker raised an eyebrow. \\"Do you think that would work? Could it sway the hearts of Alice's parents?\\" \\"It's not a guarantee, but it could provide them with a different perspective and make them more open to reconsidering their stance,\\" Henry replied. \\"It's an opportunity for dialogue and understanding. Ultimately, it will be their decision on whether to accept Richard's hand in marriage. But, at the very least, it is an option that respects both family traditions and the wishes of the couple in question.\\" There was a pause before the speaker nodded firmly. \\"Alright, Henry. We agree to your proposal. Let us convene this council and begin the process of reconciliation. We will play one final tune in hopes of achieving harmony.\\" Henry uncrossed his arms and leaned forward, his hands clasped on the desk before him, his expression serious. \\"Then let this be a lesson to us all that life is not just about the melodies that we're used to, but rather about finding ways to compose new tunes together - ones that respect our past while still bringing us together as a community in the present.\\" With that, the meeting concluded, and the journey to reconcile the differences between Alice's and Richard's families began. They faced challenges and disagreements, but through perseverance and a shared desire to prioritize love and understanding, they ultimately found and created a new tune that united them in harmony and led to the joyful union of Richard and Alice. It not only strengthened their bond but brought the entire community together in a celebration of love and unity, laying the foundation for a more inclusive and harmonious future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who has someone drive his hostages to safety? from the following article ? News anchor Barry Baron discovers that a drug smuggling ring is operating out of the building where he works, and is chased down and eventually shot dead by the drug dealers. His co-anchor, Dulcie Niles finds Barry's body, calls the police and prepares to film the investigation, but before the police can arrive Barry's body is stolen by the building's cleaner, Chafuka, who uses her voodoo powers to reanimate Barry's corpse as a zombie, allowing her to take over Barry's luxury apartment. In order to keep up appearances, Chafuka has Barry, who is otherwise unable to speak, continue performing his news broadcasts by controlling him with a voodoo doll, while Dulcie continues to investigate the drug ring with the help of incompetent police detective Jordan Penrose. Meanwhile, the head of the drug ring, Nolan sees one of Barry's news broadcasts and assumes that his henchmen bungled Barry's murder, and sends them to finish the job off. When they arrive at the station however, they end up being killed in a series of mishaps, and Chafuka turns them into more zombies. On seeing his zombified former henchmen, Nolan panics and takes refuge with the station's owner, Alex Cavanaugh, who it turns out is the mastermind behind the drug ring. He takes Dulcie and Jordan hostage and has Nolan drive them to safety, while Barry, Chafuka and the zombie henchmen give chase. During the course of the chase Dulcie and Jordan are rescued, and then Nolan loses control of the car, with both he and Cavanaugh being killed in the resulting crash. Chafuka turns Cavanaugh and Nolan into zombies and then takes full control of the station, with Barry continuing as lead anchor after his original personality fully returns, and Jordan quitting the police to become the station's head of security, with the zombie Nolan and his henchmen becoming security guards.

Answer:","completion":"The Bernese Mountain Dog, also known as the Berner Sennenhund or the Bernese Cattle Dog, is a large-sized working breed native to the Swiss Alps. Historically, these dogs were developed as versatile farmdogs, assisting farmers with a variety of tasks, such as herding livestock, pulling carts, and acting as loyal watchdogs. These majestic dogs are known for their strength, intelligence, and friendly disposition, making them popular choices as both working dogs and family companions. Originating from the canton of Bern in Switzerland, the Berner shares ancestry with other Swiss mountain dog breeds, such as the Appenzeller Sennenhund, the Entlebucher Mountain Dog, and the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog. All these breeds, including the Bernese Mountain dog, are descendants of ancient Mastiff-type dogs that were brought to the region by Roman armies over 2,000 years ago. Over time, these dogs were crossbred with local canines to become the distinctive breeds we know today. The Bernese Mountain Dog is a strikingly beautiful breed with a thick, tri-colored coat comprising black, white, and rust. The coat is designed to protect them from the cold and harsh weather conditions of the Swiss Alps. With a sturdy, well-balanced build, the Berner is strong and well-muscled, giving them the ability to carry out the tasks they were bred for. In terms of temperament, Bernese Mountain Dogs are known for their good-natured and easygoing personalities. They are friendly and gentle with children, making them excellent family pets. They are also known for their loyalty, intelligence, and eagerness to please, which makes them effective working dogs. While they like to be active outdoors and enjoy dog sports such as carting or drafting, they are also relatively laid-back indoors, making them well-suited to live in a variety of environments. When properly trained and socialized, Berners can get along well with other animals, including dogs and cats. They have a strong pack instinct, which means they form strong bonds with their families, sometimes becoming quite attached to their owners. Early socialization and training are critical for the Bernese Mountain Dog, as some individuals might exhibit shyness or aloofness. Certain health issues are associated with the Bernese Mountain Dog breed, including hip and elbow dysplasia, cancer, and a relatively short lifespan due to their large size. With the average Berner living for around 7 to 10 years, they have the shortest lifespan amongst all the Swiss mountain dog breeds. Through responsible breeding practices, annual health checkups, a balanced diet, and regular exercise, it is possible to maintain a Bernese Mountain Dog's well-being and extend their lifespan.

Objective: how do you treat period cramps? Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning?","completion":"In order to address period cramps effectively, I will provide a detailed analysis of various solutions, organized into four categories: lifestyle changes, home remedies, over-the-counter medication, and professional help. Each solution will be evaluated based on its effectiveness and soundness in terms of naive physics reasoning. 1. Lifestyle Changes: a. Exercise: Engaging in regular physical activity has been shown to reduce the severity of period cramps. Exercise promotes blood flow and helps release beta-endorphins, which can act as natural painkillers. This solution is sound in terms of naive physics reasoning because it encourages the movement of fluids and relies on the body's natural pain-relief response. b. Diet: Eating a balanced diet that is low in fats, high in fiber, and rich in essential nutrients can help alleviate period cramps. Consuming foods high in calcium and magnesium can also aid in muscle relaxation. This approach is sound because it addresses the fundamental role of nutrition in the body's overall function and well-being. 2. Home Remedies: a. Heat therapy: Applying a heating pad or warm compress to the lower abdomen can help relax the muscles and alleviate cramping. This solution is based on the principle that heat allows the muscles to expand and increases blood flow, leading to a reduction in pain. b. Herbal teas: Drinking chamomile, ginger, or peppermint tea may help to soothe period cramps by providing warmth and relaxation. These herbal remedies are thought to have natural anti-inflammatory and anti-spasmodic benefits. This solution is naively plausible, as the calming and anti-inflammatory effects of certain plant compounds have been widely recognized. 3. Over-the-counter Medications: a. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): NSAIDs like ibuprofen, naproxen, or aspirin can help alleviate period cramps by reducing inflammation and blocking the production of prostaglandins, which are chemicals responsible for stimulating uterine contractions. This treatment is sound in terms of naive physics reasoning because it targets the root cause of cramping through a well-understood biological mechanism. b. Acetaminophen: As a pain reliever, acetaminophen can offer temporary relief from period cramps. Although it may not address the underlying cause of the pain, it can help manage the symptoms. 4. Professional Help: a. Oral contraceptives: Hormonal birth control pills can help alleviate period cramps by regulating hormonal fluctuations and reducing the severity of contractions. This solution is sound because it utilizes the principle of hormonal balance to target the underlying cause of the discomfort. b. Prescription medications: In severe cases, a doctor may prescribe stronger medications to manage pain and inflammation. These medications may also have side effects, but they can be effective in providing relief. In conclusion, the most effective and sound solutions in terms of naive physics reasoning are those targeting the root causes of period cramps, such as lifestyle changes and some medical treatments. Dietary adjustments, regular exercise, and NSAIDs offer particularly robust solutions by addressing key factors like inflammation, prostaglandin production, and overall well-being. Home remedies and other medications can supplement these primary solutions, providing additional relief and comfort during this challenging time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Paragraph: Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), an avian coronavirus, is a cause of great economic loss in the poultry industry. The virus mainly infects respiratory epithelium, but can be also detected in other organs. The functional receptor for the virus has not been found and field strains of IBV do not infect conventional cell lines. Recently, it has been shown that the C-type lectins DC-SIGN/L-SIGN can promote entry of several coronaviruses. Here we examine whether DC-SIGN/L-SIGN are entry determinants for IBV. We show that by introducing human DC-SIGN/L-SIGN into nonpermissive cells, infection by the IBV is dramatically increased. DC-SIGN mediated infection was inhibited by mannan and anti-lectin antibodies, and was independent of sialic acid levels on the cell. Enhancement of IBV infection also occurred for different serotypes of IBV. Our findings demonstrated that even in the absence of avian-specific receptor, DC-SIGN-like lectins are capable of mediating efficient IBV infection. Title: Expression of the C-type lectins DC-SIGN or L-SIGN alters host cell susceptibility for the avian coronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus Student:","completion":"First, let's break down the task: 1.

We have to return \\"True\\" if the title is proper according to the paragraph, else return \\"False\\". Now, let's examine the given paragraph and title: Paragraph: The paragraph discusses Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), which causes economic loss in the poultry industry. It mainly infects respiratory epithelium but can also be detected in other organs. The paragraph goes on to study the role of C-type lectins (DC-SIGN/L-SIGN) in promoting the entry of several coronaviruses. It is found that introducing DC-SIGN/L-SIGN into nonpermissive cells dramatically increases infection by the IBV. The infection enhancement occurs for different serotypes of IBV, showing that DC-SIGN-like lectins can mediate efficient IBV infection. Title: Expression of the C-type lectins DC-SIGN or L-SIGN alters host cell susceptibility for the avian coronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus. Analysis: The title focuses on the expression of C-type lectins (DC-SIGN or L-SIGN) and how it alters host cell susceptibility for the avian coronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus. This is consistent with the paragraph as it discusses the role of DC-SIGN/L-SIGN in increasing infection by the IBV.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person who said Presley was concerned that his 24-month spell as a GI would ruin his career?, using the article: On March 24, 1958, Presley was drafted into the U.S. Army as a private at Fort Chaffee, near Fort Smith, Arkansas. His arrival was a major media event. Hundreds of people descended on Presley as he stepped from the bus; photographers then accompanied him into the fort. Presley announced that he was looking forward to his military stint, saying that he did not want to be treated any differently from anyone else: \\"The Army can do anything it wants with me.\\"Presley commenced basic training at Fort Hood, Texas. During a two-week leave in early June, he recorded five songs in Nashville. In early August, his mother was diagnosed with hepatitis, and her condition rapidly worsened. Presley, granted emergency leave to visit her, arrived in Memphis on August 12. Two days later, she died of heart failure, aged 46. Presley was devastated; their relationship had remained extremely close—even into his adulthood, they would use baby talk with each other and Presley would address her with pet names.After training, Presley joined the 3rd Armored Division in Friedberg, Germany, on October 1. While on maneuvers, Presley was introduced to amphetamines by a sergeant. He became \\"practically evangelical about their benefits\\", not only for energy but for \\"strength\\" and weight loss as well, and many of his friends in the outfit joined him in indulging. The Army also introduced Presley to karate, which he studied seriously, training with Jürgen Seydel. It became a lifelong interest, which he later included in his live performances. Fellow soldiers have attested to Presley's wish to be seen as an able, ordinary soldier, despite his fame, and to his generosity. He donated his Army pay to charity, purchased TV sets for the base, and bought an extra set of fatigues for everyone in his outfit.While in Friedberg, Presley met 14-year-old Priscilla Beaulieu.

Each day Lion took a long lazy sleep under the shade of his favourite tree. He always dreamed of weaker animals bowing before him. One day Mouse ran through the jungle and tripped over Lion's huge paws. Lion woke up with a start. \\"How dare you wake me up! \\" he shouted angrily. Lion grabbed Mouse with one paw. \\"On the second thought, I'm in the mood for the snack, and you'll make a delicious meal.\\", he said. Mouse cried out, \\"King Lion, please spare me! If you let me live, I'll always remember your kindness. And, some day, I might be able to help you.\\" \\" How could such a powerless little mouse ever help me?\\" That thought made Lion laugh so much that he decided to let Mouse go. A week later, Lion was walking through the jungle on the way to his favourite tree when he stepped onto a hunter's net. The net scooped him up. No matter how he twisted and turned, he couldn't escape. When Mouse heard Lion's frightened shouts, he raced to help. Mouse quickly chewed through the ropes to make a hole in the net. Soon, Lion moved out and was free. Lion looked down at the little mouse. \\"Thank you for saving my life,\\" said Lion, smiling his widest smile. \\"I was mistaken. You are not a powerless little mouse. You are a great friend!\\" Question: What did Lion do each day? Answer: A:","completion":"Each day, Lion, King of the jungle, did multiple things. Firstly, he used to walk around the jungle displaying his power and pride as the King. He acted in a way befitting his royalty, demonstrating his dominance to the other animals living in the jungle. Secondly, he relished taking a long, lazy sleep under the shade of his favourite tree. This daily routine of his consisted of relaxing and dreaming in the tranquility of the shelter provided by his preferred tree. While sleeping, he used to dream about weaker animals bowing in submission before him, which revealed his desire for power and respect.

Contractual requirements totally prevent using her image in the film, so he must re-shoot. Instead, Viktor experiments with a new computer program he inherits from late acquaintance Hank Aleno (Elias Koteas) which allows creation of a computer-generated woman which he can easily animate to play the film's central character. Viktor names his virtual actor \\"Simone\\", a name derived from the computer program's title, Simulation One. Seamlessly incorporated into the film, Simone (Rachel Roberts) gives a fantastic performance, exactly controlled by Viktor. The film is immediately a huge success. The studio, and soon the world, ask \\"who is Simone?\\" Viktor initially claims that Simone is a recluse and requests her privacy be respected, but that only intensifies media demands for her to appear. Viktor intends to reveal the secret of her non-existence after the second picture. To satisfy demand, he executes a number of progressively ambitious stunts relying on misdirection and cinematic special effects technology. Eventually it escalates to simulated remote location video live interviews. In one instance, two determined tabloid reporters discover Viktor used out-of-date stock photography as a background during an interview instead of being on that site as claimed and blackmail him into getting Simone to make a live appearance. He arranges her to perform a song at a stadium event appearing in a cloud of smoke and then using flawless holographic technology. The perception of being in person is reinforced with realtime visualization on the stadium's monitors. Simone becomes even more famous, simultaneously becoming a double winner for the Academy Award for Best Actress, tying with herself in the process.

He had lived in many cities, including Chicago, New York, St. Louis and New Orleans, by the time he landed in California at age 16. From there he found success as a comic magician, which opened the door to his acting career. About his mother, he said to People: “She was a hustler, yeah. She did a lot of things. We moved around a lot, and she had a lot of men friends.” But he said his childhood was not bad, adding that his dubious background should not be viewed any differently from his mother’s. “I respect my mother; she was very concerned with taking care of us,” he said. “She did what needed to be done to try to keep us together. People find my criminal days amusing, but they find her background shocking. I don’t draw any line.” Mr. Anderson told People that his father was a salesman who was mostly absent from his life, and that he had not seen him for 15 years before his death. Mr. Anderson is survived by his wife, the former Elizabeth Morgan, and two children from his first marriage, to Leslie Pollack: Eva Fay Anderson, a writer and producer in Los Angeles; and Dashiell Anderson, a teacher.

Hallingse said no foul play is suspected in Anderson's death. TMZ reports that Anderson's son said the actor \\"passed away of natural causes.\\" According to TMZ, Anderson also appeared on \\"Saturday Night Live,\\" as well as \\"Cheers.\\" TMZ also reports that Anderson starred in his own sitcom, \\"Dave's World,\\" and was a magician. Anderson is survived by his wife, Elizabeth, and two children. ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. / Updated By Alex Johnson Harry Anderson, the magician-turned-comic-turned-actor best known for playing a lightly disguised version of himself as a judge on the TV sitcom \\"Night Court,\\" was found dead Monday morning at his home in Asheville, North Carolina, police told NBC News. Anderson was 65. The cause of death wasn't disclosed, but police said foul play wasn't suspected. Anderson, who often said he was inspired to pursue magic by Harry Blackstone Sr., the famed stage magician of the last century, grew up in Southern California and began performing at clubs like Dante Magic Club and the Magic Castle while he was still in high school. His stage name was Harry the Hat for the fedora he habitually wore. Anderson appeared numerous times on Johnny Carson's version of \\"The Tonight Show\\" and \\"Saturday Night Live\\" during the 1980s and soon became a recurring guest star on \\"Cheers,\\" playing a swindler and grifter called, not surprisingly, Harry the Hat. That led to his starring role beginning in 1984 on \\"Night Court,\\" in which he played Harry Stone, a judge in New York's Criminal Court 2 who traded jokes with a naïve public defender played by Markie Post, a slimy prosecutor played by John Laroquette and three regular bailiffs (Selma Diamond, Richard Moll and Marsha Warfield). Occasionally, they tried a case or two. Anderson was nominated for Emmy awards three times during the show's nine-season run. Harry the Hat, meanwhile, returned occasionally to \\"Cheers,\\" explaining his extended absences with throwaway lines like \\"Two to 10, with time off for good behavior.\\" Anderson moved straight from \\"Night Court\\" to \\"Dave's World,\\" playing Dave Barry, the Pulitzer Prize-winning humor columnist for The Miami Herald. The series ran for four years on CBS. Barry said on Twitter that Anderson \\"was a very talented guy, and, more important, a genuinely nice guy.\\" Anderson made guest appearances on several TV shows and appeared in several pilots after \\"Dave's World\\" ended. He ran a magic shop and a nightclub in New Orleans before he and his wife, Elizabeth, moved to Asheville in 2006 after Hurricane Katrina. He told The New York Times at the time that the depression that gripped the city after the hurricane had depressed both his audience and his outlook on life. \\"I had more people in my car last night,\\" The Times quoted him as telling his piano player during a performance. Anderson had a devoted following among fellow performers. An early fan was the actor and writer Judd Apatow, who interviewed Anderson in 1983, before \\"Night Court\\" went on the air, for his book \\"Sick in the Head: Conversations About Life and Comedy.\\" He described Anderson as \\"this demented, semi-famous magician whom I happened to find hilarious.\\" Apatow said Monday on Twitter that Anderson was \\"a kind talent who made millions so happy.\\" J. Elvis Weinstein, a co-founder and star of \\"Mystery Science Theater 3000,\\" called Anderson \\"one of the few guys to ever make my 'magicians I like' list.\\" For all his TV success, Anderson always remained a magician and illusionist at heart. In 1988, he was honored as Magician of the Year by the Academy of Magical Arts, which operates the Magic Castle, following in the footsteps of Blackstone, his idol. ||||| Tweet with a location You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

What is the answer??","completion":"In order to solve the given equation, 13 = 10*k - 23*k for k, we will perform the following steps: Step 1: Combine the 'k' terms on the right side of the equation. Since both terms on the right side of the equation contain 'k', we can combine them by treating 'k' as a common factor. 10*k - 23*k = (10 - 23) * k = -13*k So, the equation now becomes: 13 = -13*k Step 2: Isolate the 'k' on one side of the equation. To find the value of 'k', we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. In this case, we will isolate 'k' on the right side of the equation. To do that, we will divide both sides of the equation by -13. 13 / (-13) = (-13*k) / (-13) Simplifying the equation: -1 = k Step 3: Write out the answer. The value of 'k' is now isolated on the right side, and we find that k = -1.

Question: \\"Which happened first, the defeat at Yorktown or the Peace of Paris?\\" Context: \\"During the 1760s and early 1770s, relations between the Thirteen Colonies and Britain became increasingly strained, primarily because of resentment of the British Parliament's attempts to govern and tax American colonists without their consent. This was summarised at the time by the slogan \\"No taxation without representation\\", a perceived violation of the guaranteed Rights of Englishmen. The American Revolution began with rejection of Parliamentary authority and moves towards self-government. In response Britain sent troops to reimpose direct rule, leading to the outbreak of war in 1775. The following year, in 1776, the United States declared independence. The entry of France to the war in 1778 tipped the military balance in the Americans' favour and after a decisive defeat at Yorktown in 1781, Britain began negotiating peace terms. American independence was acknowledged at the Peace of Paris in 1783.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"The defeat at Yorktown happened first, followed by the Peace of Paris. To provide a deeper understanding of these two critical events during the American Revolution and their chronological order, let's delve into the historical context and significance of each. The American Revolution, which began in 1775, was primarily triggered by the Thirteen Colonies' increasing resentment towards Britain's control over their governance and taxation without representation. As a result, the colonies sought to establish their self-governance and declared independence in 1776. France's entry into the war in 1778 played a vital role in shifting the military balance in favor of the Americans. The defeat at Yorktown, also known as the Siege of Yorktown or the Battle of Yorktown, took place in 1781. It is regarded as a decisive event during the American Revolutionary War, where American forces, led by General George Washington, and French forces, commanded by General Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau, successfully encircled and defeated the British Army under the command of Lieutenant General Charles Cornwallis. This critical turning point proved instrumental in convincing the British government that victory in the American colonies was unlikely. As a direct result of this defeat, British Prime Minister Lord North resigned, and his successor, Lord Rockingham, initiated peace negotiations with the Americans. This ultimately led to the signing of the Treaty of Paris, also known as the Peace of Paris, in 1783. The Treaty of Paris marked the end of the Revolutionary War and formally recognized the United States of America as an independent sovereign nation. The treaty also established the boundaries between the new United States and British territories in North America. In summary, the defeat at Yorktown occurred first in 1781 and dramatically changed the course of the war, ushering in peace negotiations between the American colonies and Britain. The Peace of Paris, signed in 1783, formalized the end of the conflict, acknowledged American independence, and set the stage for the nation's ongoing development."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Passage 1: In the United States,the financial crisis has left the country with 11 million fewer jobs than Americans need now.No matter how tough the policy ,we are not going to find 11 million new jobs soon.So common sense suggests we should make some decisions about who should come first:older people,who have already worked three or four decades at hard jobs? Or younger people,many just out of school,with fresh skills and ambitions? The answer is obvious.Older people who would like to retire and would do so if they could afford it should get some help.The right step is to reduce,not increase,the retirement age.As a rough cut,why not make it a law to set a three--year window during which the age for receiving full Social Security benefits would drop to 62----providing a voluntary ,one--time,grab-it-now bonus for leaving work? Let them go home! With a secure pension and medical care,they will be happier.Young people who need work will be happier.And there will also be more jobs.With pension security, older people will consume services until the end of their lives.They will become.each and every one,an employer. Passage 2: Too many people see longer working lives as a worry rather than an opportunity--and not just because they are going to be chained to their desks.Some worry that there will not be enough jobs to go around.This misunderstanding,known to economists as the\\"lump of labour fallacy \\",was once used to argue that women should stay at home and leave all the jobs for breadwinning males.Now lump-of-labourites say that keeping the old at work would deprive the young of employment.The idea that society can become better-off by paying more of its citizens to be idle is clearly ridiculous.On that reasoning,if the retirement age came down to 25 we would all be as rich as Bill Gates. Question: What is the author's attitude towards earlier retirement in Passage 2?

It is most often found in the form of sweetened condensed milk (SCM), with sugar added, and the two terms \\"condensed milk\\" and \\"sweetened condensed milk\\" are often used synonymously today. Sweetened condensed milk is a very thick, sweet product which when canned can last for years without refrigeration if not opened. Condensed milk is used in numerous dessert dishes in many countries. - Theobroma is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae, that is sometimes classified as a member of Sterculiaceae. It contains roughly 20 species of small understory trees native to the tropical forests of Central and South America. The generic name is derived from the Greek words (\\"theos\\"), meaning \\"god,\\" and (\\"broma\\"), meaning \\"food\\". It translates to \\"food of the gods.\\" - The Brigadeiro ( Portuguese for Brigadier ; also known in some southern Brazilian states as negrinho , literally \`\` blackie '' ) is a common Brazilian delicacy , created in 1940 . It is common throughout the entire country , as well as in Portugal , and is present in practically all the major Brazilian celebrations . Other types of Brazilian delicacies are Cajuzinho and Beijinho . The Brigadeiro is made from condensed milk , powdered chocolate , butter and chocolate sprinkles to cover the outside layer . It can be cooked in the oven or the microwave , in the form of individual little balls . It can also be eaten straight from the pot once it is done cooking . The information regarding when and where the Brigadeiro was invented is uncertain .

With an estimated population of around 15.8 million, it is the most populated state in Central America. A representative democracy, Guatemala's capital and largest city is Nueva Guatemala de la Asunción, also known as Guatemala City. - Milk is a pale liquid produced by the mammary glands of mammals. It is the primary source of nutrition for infant mammals (including humans who breastfeed) before they are able to digest other types of food. Early-lactation milk contains colostrum, which carries the mother's antibodies to its young and can reduce the risk of many diseases. It contains many other nutrients including protein and lactose. - Water is a transparent and nearly colorless chemical substance that is the main constituent of Earth's streams, lakes, and oceans, and the fluids of most living organisms. Its chemical formula is HO, meaning that its molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, that are connected by covalent bonds. Water strictly refers to the liquid state of that substance, that prevails at standard ambient temperature and pressure; but it often refers also to its solid state (ice) or its gaseous state (steam or water vapor). It also occurs in nature as snow, glaciers, ice packs and icebergs, clouds, fog, dew, aquifers, and atmospheric humidity. - The Aztec people were certain ethnic groups of central Mexico, particularly those groups who spoke the Nahuatl language and who dominated large parts of Mesoamerica from the 14th to 16th centuries. The Nahuatl words \\"aztecatl\\" (singular) and \\"aztecah\\" (plural) mean \\"people from Aztlan\\", a mythological place for the Nahuatl-speaking culture of the time, and later adopted as the word to define the Mexica people. Often the term \\"Aztec\\" refers exclusively to the Mexica people of Tenochtitlan (now the location of Mexico City), situated on an island in Lake Texcoco, who referred to themselves as \\"Mxihcah Tenochcah\\" or \\"Clhuah Mexihcah\\" . - Vanilla is a flavoring derived from orchids of the genus \\"Vanilla\\", primarily from the Mexican species, flat-leaved vanilla (\\"V. planifolia\\"). The word \\"vanilla\\", derived from the diminutive of the Spanish word (\\"vaina\\" itself meaning sheath or pod), is translated simply as \\"little pod\\". Pre-Columbian Mesoamerican people cultivated the vine of the vanilla orchid, called \\"tlilxochitl\\" by the Aztecs. Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés is credited with introducing both vanilla and chocolate to Europe in the 1520s. - Theobroma cacao is the taxonomic classification for the plant also called the cacao tree and the cocoa tree, which is a small (tall) evergreen tree in the family Malvaceae, native to the deep tropical regions of Central and South America. Its seeds, cocoa beans, are used to make cocoa mass, cocoa powder, confectionery, ganache and chocolate. - Mesoamerica was a region and cultural area in the Americas, extending approximately from central Mexico to Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and northern Costa Rica, within which pre-Columbian societies flourished before the Spanish colonization of the Americas in the 15th and 16th centuries. It is one of six areas in the world where ancient civilization arose independently, and the second in the Americas along with Norte Chico (Caral-Supe) in present-day northern coastal Peru. - Chocolate is a typically sweet, usually brown food preparation of \\"Theobroma cacao\\" seeds, roasted and ground, and often flavored with vanilla. It is made in the form of a liquid, paste, or in a block, or used as a flavoring ingredient in other foods. Cacao has been cultivated by many cultures for at least three millennia in Mesoamerica. The earliest evidence of use traces to the Mokaya (Mexico and Guatemala), with evidence of chocolate beverages dating back to 1900 BCE. In fact, the majority of Mesoamerican people made chocolate beverages, including the Maya and Aztecs, who made it into a beverage known as \\"xocoltl\\" , a Nahuatl word meaning \\"bitter water\\". The seeds of the cacao tree have an intense bitter taste and must be fermented to develop the flavor. - Sugar is the generalized name for sweet, short-chain, soluble carbohydrates, many of which are used in food. They are composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. There are various types of sugar derived from different sources. Simple sugars are called monosaccharides and include glucose (also known as dextrose), fructose, and galactose. The table or granulated sugar most customarily used as food is sucrose, a disaccharide. (In the body, sucrose hydrolyses into fructose and glucose.) Other disaccharides include maltose and lactose. Longer chains of sugars are called oligosaccharides. Chemically-different substances may also have a sweet taste, but are not classified as sugars. Some are used as lower-calorie food substitutes for sugar, described as artificial sweeteners.

Had to buy another real for it. Pole bends over bringing in a bluegill. Answer: A:","completion":"There is a clear negative tone to this product review. The sentiment expressed by the author is unmistakably critical and dissatisfied with the product described. We can analyze the review in terms of the language used, the tone of the author, and the overall narrative to explain why this review has a negative tone. Language analysis: 1. The title of the review, \\"A real piece of junk,\\" uses strong and derogatory language. The word \\"junk\\" implies that the product is worthless or garbage, immediately setting a negative tone from the beginning. 2. The author uses phrases such as \\"fell apart\\" and \\"pole bends over,\\" which highlight the product's lack of durability and poor quality. These phrases convey a sense of disappointment and frustration, contributing to the negative sentiment in the review. Tone of the author: 1. The reviewer seems to express anger or frustration in the review, recounting a specific instance where the product failed when bringing in a fish. This personal anecdote evokes emotions of disappointment and impatience with the item. 2. The reviewer states that the product made them lose a fish, displaying their dissatisfaction with its performance. This experience likely left the author feeling frustrated and upset – emotions that can be felt in the negative tone of their review. Overall narrative: 1. From a broader perspective, this review narrates the tale of a product that failed to satisfy the needs of the author. Losing a fish due to a device's malfunction is likely to displease any customer, especially someone for whom the product is integral to their hobby or passion. 2. The fact that the reviewer had to buy another reel highlights the inconvenience and additional expenses they encountered because of the product's poor quality. Also, the mention of the pole bending over while bringing in a seemingly smaller fish (a bluegill) suggests that the product is not fit for purpose. It reveals that not only the reel but also the pole was unsatisfactory, further adding to the negativity of the review. In conclusion, the language used, the author's tone, and the overall narrative in this product review all indicate a strong negative sentiment. The reviewer's dissatisfaction and frustration with the product can be clearly felt in their critique."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Summarize this article: 2 years ago (CNN) - Congressional leaders have been invited to the White House for a meeting at 10 a.m. ET Friday–the day forced spending cuts are scheduled to start taking effect, two sources said Wednesday. But while President Barack Obama was on Capitol Hill Wednesday for a Rosa Parks statue unveiling, he met with congressional leaders for a brief, minute-long meeting. Follow @politicalticker According to an Obama administration official, the president discussed the forced spending cuts and said that during their pending White House meeting on Friday they need to be \\"ready to talk solutions.\\" Obama met with the following leaders on Capitol Hill: House Speaker John Boehner, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, and Assistant House Democratic Leader James Clyburn. Asked by CNN if the discussion led to anything, Reid suggested it was just a quick huddle. When pressed on if he was surprised the White House meeting was scheduled for Friday, the Nevada Democrat gave a big smile and said, \\"Nothing surprises me anymore.\\" Pelosi also told CNN in an exclusive interview that the meeting before the ceremony was brief. \\"We just came together and talked about looking forward to getting together on Friday,\\" she said. Pelosi downplayed the timing of the White House meeting saying, \\"I have no idea, I guess it's just a scheduling thing. \\" \\"I don't have any problem with us meeting on Friday,\\" she added. \\"I think what we're talking about is beyond sequester.\\" Another Democratic official who was at the short gathering described the setting as “regular protocol” for these events–top leaders typically greet the president in an area off-stage and walk in shortly before the event begins. A GOP aide told CNN that Republicans do not anticipate the White House meeting to be anything more than optics–an effort, the aide said, by Obama to show he is at least talking to Congress on the day the cuts are supposed to kick in. But the aide added it wasn't clear what was on the president's agenda. By the time Obama meets with the leaders, the cuts–85 billion worth over the next seven months–could have already started to take place. It all depends on when Obama issues an order to let them begin. He has until 11:59 p.m. ET on Friday to issue the order, according to an official with the Office of Management and Budget. A senior congressional Republican chided Obama for the timing of the meeting. \\"Either someone needs to buy the White House a calendar, or this is just a – belated – farce,\\" the Republican said. \\"They ought to at least pretend to try.\\" And McConnell released a statement, saying \\"The meeting Friday is an opportunity for us to visit with the President about how we can all keep our commitment to reduce Washington spending.\\" He continued: \\"With a 16.6 trillion national debt, and a promise to the American people to address it, one thing is perfectly clear: we will cut Washington spending. We can either secure those reductions more intelligently, or we can do it the President’s way with across-the board cuts. But one thing Americans simply will not accept is another tax increase to replace spending reductions we already agreed to.” Reid, however, took to the Senate floor earlier Wednesday to \\"make sure everyone understands this is not President Obama's sequester.\\" \\"Congress has the power to (a)void these self-inflicted wounds,\\" he added. \\"But Democrats can’t do it alone. Republicans have to do their part. Compromise is never easy but surely it is better than doing nothing at all.\\" - CNN's Jake Tapper and Jessica Yellin contributed to this report. ||||| It’s seems like we’ve been here before. It’s midweek in Washington, a budget deadline looms on Friday that’s sure to cause some measure of havoc around the country and both sides are busy posturing in front of inanimate or human props. Text Size - + reset POLITICO LIVE: Obama, Boehner to meet Team Obama's sequester scare But this fight is different from other fights: There is no urgency to solve it. No all-night bargaining sessions that have leaders whipping votes over boxes of freshly delivered pizza. No eleventh-hour breakthrough in closed rooms in the Capitol basement. President Barack Obama and House Speaker John Boehner haven’t spoken since Thursday. Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid haven’t met since Jan. 21. (Also on POLITICO: Boehner draws a line in the sequester sand) But on Tuesday, Obama summoned Boehner, Reid, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to a Friday meeting at the White House. It’s the same day that the sequester will take effect, though, so it’s not going to stop the cuts from happening. The across-the-board spending cuts — known as the sequester — that Obama said wouldn’t happen and Boehner had promised his members he and Senate leadership would work to sidestep — in fact, will take hold. Instead of inching closer together in these closing days, the sides are moving farther apart. Obama went to Newport News, Va., Tuesday and called for slashing tax loopholes to offset the cuts. Boehner gave a speech to the Credit Union National Association and said, “Yes, we should close loopholes, but we should do it as part of tax reform that lowers rates and helps create jobs.” (WATCH: Obama blasts Congress on sequestration) In short, they are nowhere. The Senate will try to pass a bill to increase taxes on high-income earners this week. If it gets past the Senate and the likely 60-vote threshold, it still won’t pass the House. Boehner said his chamber shouldn’t have to pass its sequester replacement bill again before the Senate “gets off their ass” and passes a bill. The real problem: Neither bill would pass the other chamber. And get this: The House will leave town on Friday — just as the cuts take hold. Here’s the rub: Republicans really have no idea what to think. They’re tangled in a mix of messaging about Obama crafting the sequester, the cuts being damaging but also seeking praise for having the courage to finally slash spending by at least 2 percent. (PHOTOS: What they’re saying about sequestration) Boehner and his team think they’re in a good position: Obama is calling for tax increases to blunt damaging cuts to the Pentagon, while Boehner is standing for cutting spending. The same week in which bipartisanship seems so out of reach, Boehner is voicing support for the heftiest two-party undertaking: tax reform. He even designated the leadership’s most prized bill title — H.R. 1 — to rewriting the Tax Code. “Dave Camp, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, is continuing a thoughtful and thorough review of the Tax Code with an eye on tax reform, and I fully support his work,” Boehner said at the CUNA convention, according to prepared remarks. “It’s time we shift the balance of power from the tax collector to the taxpayer.” ||||| Steep and harsh federal spending cuts kick in Friday. And that’s when President Barack Obama has invited Congressional leaders to the White House to try and resolve the standoff. Text Size - + reset POLITICO LIVE: Obama, Boehner to meet The White House on Tuesday invited House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to trek down Pennsylvania Avenue to meet on the 85 billion across-the-board cuts, known as the sequester. Republicans on Capitol Hill say the last-minute invitation to the White House Tuesday for a Friday meeting is a sign that the president is not serious about stopping the cuts. (WATCH: Boehner: White House 'trying to play games') The Senate is set to unveil competing plans — one Republican and one Democratic — to stop and perhaps give Obama more flexibility to reprogram the spending cuts in the sequester. But those measures, which will get a vote on Thursday, both are expected to need a 60-vote threshold in the Senate, and both are expected to fail. The White House said Wednesday that it doesn’t expect anything to come of the Senate votes, and press secretary Jay Carney sought to blame Republicans for the massive cuts that will ensue. “Obviously the Senate will vote on proposals — or at least one proposal that would eliminate, or rather postpone, the deadline for the sequester — a balanced proposal that the president supports, a balanced proposal that a majority of the Senate will support, unfortunately a proposal that, while earning a majority vote is likely to be blocked by Republican leaders who will thereby be making a choice that we should let the sequester go into effect rather than ask that some special interest tax breaks be eliminated,” Carney said. (Also on POLITICO: Senate GOP ponders ceding power) “Hopefully that won’t come to pass but certainly, based on what we’ve seen from Republicans thus far, that is a more likely outcome.” The president spoke briefly with the top four Hill leaders during a statue dedication ceremony for Rosa Parks at the Capitol Wednesday, but Carney didn’t indicate progress. He reiterated the White House’s insistence that revenues be part of any deal and excoriated Republicans for failing to even consider then. “We remain hopeful that at some point, hopefully soon, Republicans will understand the need to compromise here, and that compromise has balance at its essence,” Carney said. “The president looks forward to a conversation when he has this meeting that is constructive and that includes suggestions by leaders about how we can move forward toward the kind of balanced deficit reduction that this is all about,” he said. (PHOTOS: What they’re saying about sequestration) “If the President is serious about stopping the sequester, why did he schedule a meeting on Tuesday for Friday when the sequester hits at midnight on Thursday?” a Capitol Hill Republican sniped. “Either someone needs to buy the White House a calendar, or this is just a — belated – farce. They ought to at least pretend to try.” ||||| Senate GOP divided on sequester plan By Erik Wasson - Two days before 85 billion in automatic spending cuts hit the government, Senate Republicans are divided over a bill backed by their leadership that would replace the sequester. The measure would require that 85 billion in spending be cut, but give President Obama more flexibility in manage the spending reductions than given by the sequester, which requires across-the-board cuts to nearly every part of every agency. But some Republicans fear it would help the White House use the cuts as a political weapon, while defense hawks worry the Pentagon would not escape harm. Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.) said the plan doesn't address the damage that the sequester cuts would inflict on the military. “I don’t care how flexible you want to be, the top-line numbers don’t add up to me on defense. That’s my problem,\\" Graham said after a contentious GOP meeting where the plan was discussed. Coming up with a favored approach is important as both sides try to win public support over how they are handling the sequester. The Senate is expected to vote this week on rival legislative measures backed by Democrats and Republicans. While both bills are expected to fail, they could help give each party political cover. Leaders on both sides will be looking at the vote count carefully, raising the stakes for Republicans to rally their members around one alternative. So far, Senate Democrats look like the more unified side. Most if not all Democrats are expected to support their conference’s 110 billion sequester replacement bill that would phase in a new minimum tax on those making more than 1 million a year, close corporate tax loopholes, end direct farm payments and delay defense cuts. Such unity isn’t evident around the likely GOP alternative offered by Sens. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) and Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) and supported by GOP leaders. The bill, which would give Obama more leeway in carrying out sequestration, was discussed Tuesday in the Senate Republican conference meeting. In general, Republicans more comfortable with defense cuts supported this effort, while hawks like McCain and Graham were skeptical. Opponents complain the plan would cede Congress's power of the purse to the president. Others say it does nothing to address the sequester’s damaging cuts to defense and national security. \\"I've never seen so much passion about something that is not going to pass,\\" Corker said Tuesday after the party’s weekly lunch. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) acknowledged Tuesday that the party might have to offer more than one sequester alternative amendment on the Senate floor, if Democrats consent to multiple votes. \\"Speaking for myself, I would be happy to give the president more flexibility and rely on the agency heads to portion the spending reductions in different ways,\\" McConnell said. \\"There are some members of our conference who are suspicious that the administration would take advantage of such flexibility to punish their political enemies.\\" \\"We'll see how many votes we'll have. That's up for discussion,\\" McConnell said. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said Tuesday he would only allow one GOP bill. He has set the Senate up for Thursday votes. The plan from Toomey and Corker would give the Obama administration more power to choose which federal programs and activities will be slashed to meet the 85 billion target. The flexibility would apply equally to domestic and defense spending, Corker said, in contrast to an earlier proposal floated by Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.) that would have just given flexibility over Pentagon cuts. Graham said that he would support a deficit grand bargain that raises 600 billion in revenues in exchange for massive entitlement reform. Such a bargain would presumably restore all nine years of defense cuts on the horizon. The GOP conference is also weighing a proposal from Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) to replace the sequester cuts with a reduction in the overall federal workforce through attrition. McCain and Graham support the Ayotte approach. Toomey said his proposal preserves the magnitude of the sequester cuts because the nation's budget situation demands it. He said “given the disastrous fiscal situation we are in, we’ve got to support these cuts.” The Pennsylvania senator said that the proposal could be redesigned to include a provision giving Congress a final vote to disapprove a presidential sequester plan. He argued that after Oct. 1, the remaining eight years of automatic spending cuts are accomplished through lower budget caps, not the seizing of funds known as sequestration, so congressional power isn't ceded for long. Corker concurred, arguing the plan \\"is the best solution for the next seven months. After that it moves to the appropriations process.\\" Once the sequester takes effect, supporters of the idea said, the flexibility bill could gain traction and could be difficult for Obama to reject. Democrats showed no signs of supporting any of the GOP ideas. Sen. Carl Levin (Mich.), the Democratic chairman of the Armed Services Committee, blasted the GOP approach as passing the buck to the White House. “I think it’s a mistake in general to give the power of the purse to the president and say, ‘Here’s a pot of money; spend it as you wish,' ” Levin said. “That kind of, what’s called ‘flexibility,’ is really an abdication of what the responsibilities of the Congress are.” Corker said that at this stage, the GOP proposal and a separate Democratic sequester replacement bill that raises taxes will fail in Senate votes this week. “I can’t imagine either bill is going to pass,” he said. “That’s why I’m booking a flight to head out of town Thursday night.” This story was posted on Feb. 26 at 4:46 p.m. and has been updated. ||||| In Killeen, Tex., where the country’s largest Army post drives the local economy, automatic federal budget cuts would furlough about 6,000 of Fort Hood’s civil service workers for one day each week. Mayor Dan Corbin predicted home sales and construction would grind to a halt; restaurant and shop owners, he said, are “worried sick.” Of those who think the reductions wouldn’t have a painful impact, the Republican said: “I don’t know what planet these people are living on.” That planet is about 200 miles north on the interstate in Collin County: sprawling and well-to-do suburban Dallas. Sure, some federal grants would go away, but County Judge Keith Self said few of Collin’s 800,000-plus residents would notice. “We can handle this,” said Self, also a Republican and the county’s top elected official. “Anything we can cut — sure, absolutely.” President Obama is painting a dire portrait of across-the-board doom and gloom from the automatic cuts, known as sequestration, set to begin Friday. But the sequester is really like a tornado, scattershot in its course. It would strike some communities and largely bypass others, cutting across class, politics and geography. Interviews with more than a dozen state and municipal leaders coast to coast show that the sequester would afflict big cities and military communities — because of cuts to social programs and defense — far more than middle-class suburbs or rural areas. The disparity in some ways mirrors the nation’s electoral divide between Democrats and Republicans. The discrepancies help explain why House Republicans — many of whom represent rural and outer suburban districts — feel little urgency to strike a deal with Obama and avert the sequester. They also suggest that the misery expected Friday would not be universal, meaning that public outcry may not be loud or widespread enough to propel Washington toward a quick solution. “Until the pain gets hard enough, they probably won’t do anything,” said Steve Bell of the Bipartisan Policy Center. The sequester is a package of across-the-board, indiscriminate spending cuts that total 85 billion for the current fiscal year and 1.2 trillion over the next decade. The cuts are split evenly between the defense budget and non-defense discretionary spending, which includes many federal grants to state and local agencies. Mandatory programs, including Social Security and Medicaid, are spared. Military communities would be hit hard with work stoppages. Pay for border patrol agents would be cut. Some funding for teachers would get the ax, and reductions are in store for HIV testing, job-search assistance and Meals on Wheels for senior citizens. And yet the federal government is so sprawling that millions of Americans may never feel any effect from the cuts. “This is going to hit some areas and regions much more than others,” Bell said. “This is not a situation where on the second of March the lights are going to go off or people are going to be sent home. This is a slow-moving kind of situation which will aggregate itself.” In Los Angeles, the nation’s second-largest public school district would lose 37 million in federal funding. Schools Superintendent John Deasy said that amounts to about 100,000 per school — “easily an employee or employee and a half.” The budget cuts would specifically impact programs that help impoverished students, many of whom speak Spanish, prepare for kindergarten and learn to read. “It affects the youth who live in greatest poverty much more so than just across the district,” Deasy said. “The effects are you don’t come to school ready to learn in kindergarten, you don’t learn to read by the end of third grade and you don’t graduate on time.” Minneapolis Mayor R.T. Rybak (D) said the budget cuts would impact the most vulnerable residents of his city. Head Start and employment training programs would suffer, and some grant money to fight crime in high-impact neighborhoods would disappear. “Minneapolis is a very successful city on almost every level except we have a very large gap between haves and have-nots, and this will cut exactly those services that help close the gap,” he said. Besides these cuts, Rybak said any other impact from the sequester would be more indirect — such as a corresponding dip in the consumer economy. He said he worries that Target and Best Buy,which are headquartered in Minneapolis, might have declining sales if customers nationwide spend less amid the uncertainty. For Hennepin County, which encompasses Minneapolis and many of its suburbs, the impact would be minimal, said Mike Opat, chairman of Hennepin County Board of Commissioners. “If you’re not receiving a check or food stamps, you’re probably not likely to hear the impact of the sequester immediately,” he said. “If there are teachers that are laid off, that would be one example, but the general middle-class citizen is not going to feel this right away.” The same cannot be said for military communities like Newport News, where Obama visited a nuclear submarine factory on Tuesday to sound the alarm about deep defense cuts. In Hinesville, Ga., where Fort Stewart dominates the local economy, Mayor James Thomas Jr. said the sequester would have a 56 million impact, forcing furloughs at the massive Army post. He said it would be the biggest blow to Hinesville’s businesses since the Persian Gulf War in 1990, when thousands of U.S. troops deployed to Kuwait. “This is serious,” Thomas said, echoing the concerns of Corbin, the mayor of Killeen. “When you have a military installation next to your city, you’ve got to be very concerned about anything that affects them because it affects us all.” There are similar worries along Arizona’s border with Mexico, where agents with the U.S. Border Patrol are bracing for furloughs. Art Del Cueto, president of Local 2544, the union that represents more than 3,000 border patrol agents, said the forced time off would mean pay cuts of up to 40 percent. “Who in this country can afford a 40 percent pay cut?” Del Cueto said. “If they’re saying it’s not going to have an impact, that’s lying. They need to come down here and walk in the agents’ boots.” Discuss this topic and other political issues in the politics discussion forums. ||||| Summary:","completion":"Congressional leaders were invited to the White House for a meeting regarding forced spending cuts that were scheduled to start taking effect. Leaders on Capitol Hill who met with President Barack Obama included House Speaker John Boehner, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, and Assistant House Democratic Leader James Clyburn. As the 85 billion worth of cuts could have already started to take place, a senior congressional Republican criticized Obama for the timing of the meeting. However, others insist on the importance of cutting Washington spending as the national debt is at 16.6 trillion. While some leaders are unsure if an agreement can be made in time to prevent the forced spending cuts, others hope that a compromise can be reached soon."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sally catches the ball. Sally then throws the ball back to Rhonda, as hard as she can, but the ball doesn't make it all the way to Rhonda. Which girl has more strength in her arm? (A) Rhonda (B) Sally. What is the most sensical answer between \\"Rhonda\\" and \\"Sally\\"? Answer:","completion":"The most sensical answer between \\"Rhonda\\" and \\"Sally\\" is (A) Rhonda. When comparing the scenario with Rhonda and Sally, the relative strength of each girl's arm is evaluated by their ability to throw a baseball. The distance a baseball is thrown can be influenced by a number of factors including technique, angle of throw, and the power or strength applied during the throw. In the case described in this short story, Rhonda is successful in throwing the baseball over the fence to Sally. It implies that Rhonda has enough muscle strength to propel the baseball a significant distance. Contrastingly, when Sally attempts to return the ball, her throw does not manage to reach Rhonda, failing to achieve the same distance that Rhonda's throw did. This might suggest that Sally couldn't apply the same amount of force during her throw as Rhonda did. One valid interpretation of this could be that Sally doesn't have the same strength in her arm as Rhonda, or at least not in the context of throwing a baseball. Of course, there could be other factors at play here as well. Maybe Sally doesn't have the same throwing technique as Rhonda, or perhaps the wind was against Sally when she threw the ball. However, based strictly on the information provided, it is most reasonable to conclude that Rhonda has more strength in her arm than Sally, because she was able to throw the ball over the fence, while Sally was unable to replicate the feat. Therefore, the answer should be (A) Rhonda, as she demonstrated a greater ability to throw the baseball."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Citing states’ rights, jobs and the right to bear arms, congressional Republicans are reversing dozens of Obama-era rules affecting the environment, education and the energy sector. The GOP is using a largely unknown but highly effective legislative tool that allows a simple majority in the House and Senate to overturn regulations that often took years to craft. Indeed, with an overhaul of health insurance going off the rails, Republicans are left pointing to the repeal of various government regulations as their crowning legislative achievement after some 70 days at work. The GOP casts the effort as overturning eight years of excessive government regulation and boosting business. “These things will help get people back to work, and after years of sluggish growth, give a real boost to our economy,” Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said this past week. The president has signed eight resolutions revoking regulations issued during the final months of Democrat Barack Obama’s presidency. Six resolutions have cleared Congress and are awaiting the president’s signature. A couple dozen more are on deck, with last Thursday the deadline for filing more. Trump has signed measures eliminating requirements that mining and oil companies report payments made to foreign governments. The rule was designed to shine a light on how much money foreign governments received for their nation’s resources, thus reducing the prospect of corruption. He also signed another measure reversing an Obama plan to prevent coal mining debris from being dumped into nearby streams. “These actions from Congress and the president are giving hope to businesses that they haven’t had in a long time,” said Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi scoffed at the notion that Republicans were accomplishing anything with the regulatory repeals “because they do not meet the needs of the American people.” “They are about trickle-down. Their life is about giving more money to the high-end and to corporate interests, maybe it will trickle down, that would be good, but if it doesn’t, so be it, that’s the free market,” Pelosi said. Robert Weissman, president of Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group, said the regulatory repeals Congress pushed through will actually damage the economy more than it helps. He said that eliminating the stream protection rule may help coal companies, but it hurts other companies that stand to gain through healthier streams and water supplies. “If you look across the terrain of the Congressional Review Act resolutions, they are repeals of public measures that help, consumers, workers and the environment in very substantial ways, but are opposed by powerful corporate interests,” Weissman said. “The Republicans driving these measures are paying back their corporate benefactors at the expense of the public.” In some cases, the regulatory repeal efforts have had nothing to do with the economy, but addressed hot-button social issues that so often dominate Washington politics. Republicans blocked a Social Security Administration rule that would have prevented tens of thousands of mentally disabled beneficiaries from being able to purchase a firearm. The rule was targeted specifically at those beneficiaries with mental disorders who have a third party manage their financial benefits, and it was opposed by the NRA and several advocacy groups for the disabled. The latest repeal effort clearing both chambers required Republicans to bring Vice President Mike Pence to the Capitol so he could cast the tie-breaking vote on the abortion issue. The scrapping of the Health and Human Services rule gave states the go-ahead to deny federal family planning money to Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers. One of the more closely contested repeals would kill an online privacy regulation. Fifteen Republicans sided with Democrats in opposing the repeal, which Pelosi said would allow internet providers to sell personal information without a user’s consent. “You should be very, very scared,” she said. The ability of Congress to void regulations with a simple majority was created in 1996 when Congress passed the Congressional Review Act. In the 20 years since, Congress was only able to use it once to repeal a regulation. Congress sent five repeal resolutions to Obama, but he vetoed each of them. Trump made clear early on that he would back the efforts of the GOP-led Congress. “I will keep working with Congress, with every agency, and most importantly with the American people until we eliminate every unnecessary, harmful and job-killing regulation that we can find,” Trump said this past week. “We have a lot more coming.” The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has encouraged the regulatory rollbacks, weighing in with lawmakers on efforts affecting internet providers, federal contractors and energy companies. Neil Bradley, a senior vice president at the Chamber, acknowledges that it’s hard to say how many jobs are created or saved through the repeal of one particular rule, but he says employers of all sizes tell the chamber government regulations are a top concern that makes it harder for them to flourish. “Any time we can roll back these regulations is another step forward to restoring the economic growth that I think is the top priority of the American people,” Bradley said. ____ On Twitter, reach Kevin Freking at https://twitter.com/APkfreking","completion":"Congressional Republicans are reversing Obama-era rules affecting the environment, education, and the energy sector, using a legislative tool that enables a simple majority to repeal regulations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the most logical completion of this news story?. (CNN) -- The last few years have seen the beginnings of an energy revolution in the U.S. The coming of shale gas and now shale oil has transformed not just its energy outlook, but also the climate change debate. The game has changed: Energy independence, the goal first set by Nixon in the early 1970s, looks like being achievable, at least for the North American continent. The game that has changed has profound implications for energy and climate policy. To date it has been based upon two assumptions: The first is that fossil fuel prices would go ever upward as oil (and gas) production peaked and then declined. That, in turn, meant that energy policy should actively try to increase the security of the supply by increasing domestic energy production. The second was that climate change is best addressed by a top down international climate change agreement, and that within that framework, the U.S. should accept a cap on the amount of carbon it would release into the atmosphere. So great are the potential oil and gas reserves that already","completion":"some experts are predicting that the U.S. could overtake Saudi Arabia as the world's largest oil producer within the next decade. This newfound energy abundance has the potential to upend traditional geopolitical power dynamics and reshape the global economy. However, this shift also brings with it an array of challenges and potential consequences. For one, a persistent reliance on fossil fuels could impede the development and adoption of clean energy technologies, which are necessary for mitigating the impacts of climate change. Furthermore, achieving energy independence through the proliferation of domestic shale oil and gas production could have environmental and public health consequences if not carried out responsibly. Under these circumstances, it is likely that energy and climate policy will have to evolve to address both the opportunities and challenges presented by the shale revolution. This evolution could take several forms. For instance, policymakers may place greater emphasis on fostering innovation and investment in clean energy technologies to ensure that they remain competitive even as fossil fuel prices stabilize or decline. In addition, there may be a growing consensus that focusing on top-down international climate agreements is not the only approach to combating global warming. Instead, countries might embrace a more flexible, multi-faceted approach that combines national policies, regional initiatives, and collaborative technology development. This could mean greater emphasis on renewable energy targets, emissions trading schemes, and industry-wide partnerships to accelerate the commercialization of low-carbon technologies. Furthermore, the economic benefits of increased domestic energy production could be used to fund investments in infrastructure resilience and climate adaptation measures. These investments will help communities better withstand the impacts of a changing climate, while also creating jobs and boosting local economies. As the geopolitical landscape shifts, the U.S. may find that its energy abundance gives it greater diplomatic leverage in negotiations on climate change and other international issues. By demonstrating that it is possible to achieve energy independence while also transitioning to a low-carbon economy, the U.S. could stand as a global model for the sustainable development of energy resources. However, this requires a careful balance between maximizing the benefits of this new energy landscape and minimizing the environmental and health risks associated with fossil fuel extraction. This might involve the implementation of stringent regulations governing hydraulic fracturing (fracking) and other shale extraction techniques to protect water resources, air quality, and public health. In conclusion, the shale revolution has undeniably changed the game for energy policy and climate change. To successfully navigate the challenges and opportunities presented by this new reality, it is vital for policymakers to adapt and to pursue a diverse and balanced approach to energy production, climate protection, and sustainable development. This will involve investing in clean energy innovation, exploring different strategies for international cooperation, and ensuring the responsible and safe extraction of shale oil and gas resources. Only by embracing such a comprehensive approach can we hope to achieve long-term energy security, protect the planet for future generations, and foster economic prosperity."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Unfortunately, the former is 65 times riskier than the latter! In fact the accident rate of workers in the chemical industry is less than that of almost any of human activity, and almost as safe as staying at home.

An agricultural farm is giving prizes for the person who makes the largest homegrown project. Porky and a rival neighbor both plan to win the agricultural farm prize, Porky with his garden and the neighbor with his chickens. Porky carefully plans a box of seeds, one by one while the man is busy mixing a bunch of bottles of items together. Porky goes to retrieve something as the man feeds the brand new mixture into the feeding bin for his chickens. But when they try it out, they spit the food out in disgust and seek food elsewhere.

The neighbor checks out his handy work and comments on it, allowing his chickens to come over and eat all of his fruits and vegetables. A little chick and a bigger chicken fight over a watermelon until it flings the chick away. The chick sadly retreats until it sees a bunch of spinach and decides to munch on it instead. The chick then comes back and punches the mean chicken before finishing the watermelon. (The chick eating spinach and then changing is a thinly-veiled Popeye reference). When his garden has almost entirely been eaten, Porky finally notices the chickens and tries to get rid of them. But alas no luck, so he yells at the neighbor to get them back into his yard but the neighbor claims he doesn't know how they got on Porky's property, then attempts to \\"try\\" and make them return. He then leaves while a sad Porky heads to his door, only to find a long vine and follow it to a giant pumpkin.

The atheistic element of communism would be intensified in some Marxist movements after his death . The atheistic element of communism would be strengthened after his death in some Marxist movements .","completion":"Step 1: Identify the main elements in each sentence. Sentence 1: - atheistic element of communism - would be intensified - in some Marxist movements - after his death Sentence 2: - atheistic element of communism - would be strengthened - after his death - in some Marxist movements Step 2: Compare the elements for similarities and differences. - Both sentences discuss the atheistic element of communism, so they have a similar subject matter. - The phrases \\"would be intensified\\" and \\"would be strengthened\\" share a similar meaning, as both describe an increase in the atheistic element's influence or importance. - Both sentences mention that this change will occur after the person's death. - The impact is specified to happen within some Marxist movements in both sentences, which indicates that it is not a universal effect. Step 3: Evaluate whether the meanings are the same or different. - All main elements are either identical or very similar in meaning. - The order of some elements is different, but the overall structure of the sentences is similar and effectively conveys the same point. Conclusion: Yes, these two sentences from Wikipedia have the same meaning. They both suggest that the atheistic element of communism would become more prominent in some Marxist movements following the death of an individual. The difference in wording does not significantly alter the intended message."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Sentence: Silicone molds are the best to shape chocolate. Pick your answer from: A). Yes B). It's impossible to say C). No","completion":"B). It's impossible to say Although silicone molds are commonly used and have several advantages when it comes to shaping chocolates, it's impossible to say that they are the best for shaping chocolate without considering factors such as personal preferences, skill level, and the specific type of chocolate being used. There may be cases where metal, plastic, or various other kinds of molds might be considered better, depending on the specific requirements of a project or an individual's preferences. Let's examine some factors that might influence this choice in greater detail: 1. Material properties: Silicone molds are known for their flexibility, which makes them easier to use for removing delicate chocolate shapes with fewer breakages. They are also non-stick, which can help make the chocolate release process easier. However, metal or polycarbonate molds might offer a more rigid and sturdy structure, which could be preferred for some projects or by users who are more comfortable with these materials. 2. Heat resistance: Silicone molds are generally heat resistant and can withstand the temperatures required for melting chocolate. Some other materials, like plastic, might have issues with heat resistance, making them less suitable for certain applications with chocolate. 3. Availability: Silicone molds are readily available in a wide range of shapes and sizes, which makes them accessible for various chocolate projects. Still, individual preferences may lead someone to prefer a specific type of mold that may not be available in silicone. 4. Reusability: Silicone molds are typically reusable, as they can be cleaned easily, thus reducing waste. However, some chocolate makers may prefer other materials that are also reusable, such as metal or polycarbonate, based on their own experiences and preferences. 5. Skill level: Different materials might be more suitable for different skill levels. For example, a beginner might find a silicone mold easier to handle due to its flexibility and non-stick nature, whereas a more experienced chocolatier might prefer the rigidity of metal or polycarbonate molds. In conclusion, while silicone molds have multiple advantages when it comes to shaping chocolates, it's impossible to definitively determine that they are the best for this task without considering various factors. Personal preferences, experience, and specific requirements can all influence what someone might consider the best option when shaping chocolate."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The actor-slash-singer-slash-magician has hosted the Emmys, performed at the Oscars, and even headlined the World Magic Awards, which apparently are an actual thing.

He tells his students that the nuclei of human cells have 22 pairs of autosomes. How many sex chromosomes does the human body have? Answer:","completion":"Human cells have 23 pairs of chromosomes, out of which 22 pairs are autosomes and one pair consists of sex chromosomes. Sex chromosomes are the ones that determine an individual's sex or biological gender. In humans, there are two different sex chromosomes: X and Y. These chromosomes are not paired up like the other 22 autosomes, as their pairing varies between individuals depending on their biological gender. In general, females possess two X chromosomes, represented as XX, whereas males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome, represented as XY. The presence of the Y chromosome denotes a male, as it contains the necessary genes to trigger the development of male characteristics during the process of embryonic development. In contrast, the absence of the Y chromosome results in the development of female characteristics. Thus, human cells (more specifically, human somatic cells, which make up the majority of body cells other than sperm and egg cells) generally have a total of 46 chromosomes, with 44 autosomes and 2 sex chromosomes. In summary, the human body generally has two sex chromosomes, either XX (female) or XY (male). These sex chromosomes are responsible for determining an individual's biological gender, and they function differently from the 22 pairs of autosomes, which are primarily responsible for dictating other traits and characteristics that define each individual."},{"prompt":"Given a category and a set of five words, find the word from the set that does not belong (i.e. is the least relevant) with the other words in the category.

Britney Spears, despite a distinct lack of tweets actually posted by the singer herself, officially has the most followers on the microblogging site, though the numbers constantly fluctuate. Both are near 5 million followers; at the moment, she has about 3,600 more. “Spears’ Twitter victory flies in the face of conventional wisdom on how to use the social web,” writes Jolie O'Dell on Mashable, noting that her account is mostly promotional (sample tweet: “At my photo shoot for the limited edition collection I designed for Candie’s!”), unlike Kutcher’s (sample tweet: “‘What do U think about Brittney having more followers than u?’ Answer ‘I don't care.’”). Expand this summary.","completion":"Just nine days after Mashable's prediction, the inevitable has occurred: Ashton Kutcher, the once reigning superstar on Twitter, has been dethroned. Britney Spears, the pop music icon, has officially taken the crown for having the most followers on the popular microblogging platform. Though the numbers have been continually fluctuating, Spears currently boasts near to 5 million followers, with around 3,600 more than Kutcher's count at the time of this report. The triumph of Britney Spears on Twitter seems to challenge traditional perspectives on how to harness the power of social media effectively. Jolie O'Dell, a writer for Mashable, points out that Spears' Twitter account is predominantly promotional in nature, with tweets such as, “At my photo shoot for the limited edition collection I designed for Candie’s!” filling up her timeline. This is in stark contrast to Kutcher's account, which is known for its more engaging and interactive content, exemplified by tweets like, “'What do U think about Brittney having more followers than u?' Answer 'I don't care.'” One could argue that Spears' success on Twitter is due to her massive global fame as a pop star, which allows her to attract a significant amount of followers despite the promotional nature of her content. In comparison, Ashton Kutcher, an actor and entrepreneur, relies more on creating a genuine connection with his followers to maintain their interest and loyalty. The rise of Britney Spears on Twitter also highlights the evolving landscape of social media influence. As celebrities and public figures continue to compete for the largest following, the significance of Twitter and other social media platforms in shaping popular culture and the perception of these figures becomes increasingly apparent. This phenomenon underscores the indispensability of social media in today's digital age, particularly for those in the entertainment industry. Furthermore, the constant fluctuations in follower counts for celebrities like Spears and Kutcher demonstrate the volatile and ever-changing nature of social media popularity. While Spears may be reigning supreme today, her position could easily be toppled tomorrow by another celebrity or influencer. In conclusion, the recent overthrow of Ashton Kutcher by Britney Spears as Twitter's reigning superstar highlights the growing importance of social media platforms in shaping popular culture and the public image of famous figures. Despite differing strategies in leveraging their social media presence, both Spears and Kutcher have managed to amass a significant following. The constant fluctuations in follower numbers for these celebrities also reflect the ever-changing nature of social media popularity, emphasizing the need for continual engagement and adaptability in the digital era."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Joan Rivers cuts off CNN interview Ladies and gentlemen, Joan Rivers has left the building, er, interview. Rivers’ satellite chat with CNN’s Fredricka Whitfield started off well enough. She was even quoting Winston Churchill about how laughter gives people a vacation from horror. Rivers was on the cable news network Saturday promoting her new book, Diary of a Mad Diva, one day after she said that “we already have” a gay president in Barack Obama and that the first lady is “transgender.” About two minutes into this video, Whitfield asked her if she intentionally wore fur on the book cover, knowing she’d anger animal rights activists.

Solti recorded throughout his career for the Decca Record Company. He made more than 250 recordings, including 45 complete opera sets. During the 1950s and 1960s Decca had an alliance with RCA Victor, and some of Solti's recordings were first issued on the RCA label.Solti was one of the first conductors who came to international fame as a recording artist before being widely known in the concert hall or opera house. Gordon Parry, the Decca engineer who worked with Solti and Culshaw on the Ring recordings, observed, \\"Many people have said 'Oh well, of course John Culshaw made Solti.' This is not true. He gave him the opportunity to show what he could do.\\"Solti's first recordings were as a piano accompanist, playing at sessions in Zurich for the violinist Georg Kulenkampff in 1947. Decca's senior producer, Victor Olof did not much admire Solti as a conductor (nor did Walter Legge, Olof's opposite number at EMI's Columbia Records), but Olof's younger colleague and successor, Culshaw, held Solti in high regard. As Culshaw, and later James Walker, produced his recordings, Solti's career as a recording artist flourished from the mid-1950s. Among the orchestras with whom Solti recorded were the Berlin Philharmonic, Chicago Symphony, London Philharmonic, London Symphony and Vienna Philharmonic orchestras. Soloists in his operatic recordings included Birgit Nilsson, Joan Sutherland, Régine Crespin, Plácido Domingo, Gottlob Frick, Carlo Bergonzi, Kiri Te Kanawa and José van Dam. In concerto recordings, Solti conducted for, among others, András Schiff, Julius Katchen, Clifford Curzon, Vladimir Ashkenazy and Kyung-wha Chung.Solti's most celebrated recording was Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen made in Vienna, produced by Culshaw, between 1958 and 1965.

However, she is not seeking monetary compensation. Instead, she wants an industry standard established for fliers who need to pay for extra seats due to their size. ABC reports that Kenlie Tiggeman experienced humiliation when a gate agent made derogatory comments about her weight in front of her fellow passengers last year. Tiggeman believes that decisions regarding obese passengers should not be left to the arbitrary discretion of gate attendants. At the time of the incident, Tiggeman weighed between 240 and 300 pounds. She has since lost weight but continues to push for a standardized rule across the airline industry. According to her blog, Tiggeman's main issue with Southwest is the inconsistency in their policies. She states, \\"The problem I have with Southwest is not that they want me to purchase two seats. It's that sometimes they want that, and other times they don't. I don't know about you, but I fly a lot. And paying double because a gate agent may or may not have something against overweight people is not realistic—nor should it be necessary.\\" Tiggeman's lawsuit seeks to address the lack of a clear, consistent policy regarding passengers who might require additional seating due to their size. Establishing an industry standard would prevent individual gate agents from making decisions based on personal biases or opinions. This standard could also help avoid the public humiliation and embarrassment that Tiggeman experienced in her situation. As more people continue to fly, it is essential for airlines to address the needs of all passengers fairly and consistently. Instituting an industry standard would not only ensure proper accommodation for larger fliers but also protect them from potential discrimination or inconsistencies in airline policies. Tiggeman's fight for change serves as a reminder that the travel industry must continue to adapt and establish clear, compassionate regulations that benefit both the airlines and their diverse array of passengers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Upon returning to Toronto, Jackson published an article about his and Thomson's experience in the Park in the Toronto Sunday World, included in which were several illustrations. After this initial experience, Thomson and another colleague, William Broadhead, went on a two-month expedition, going up the Spanish River and into Mississagi Forest Reserve (today Mississagi Provincial Park). Thomson's transition from commercial art towards his own original style of painting became apparent around this time. Much of his artwork from this trip, mainly oil sketches and photographs, was lost during two canoe spills; the first was on Green Lake in a rain squall and the second in a series of rapids.In fall 1912, Albert Robson, Grip's art director, moved to the design firm Rous & Mann. A month after returning to Toronto, Thomson followed Robson and left Grip to join Rous & Mann too. They were soon joined by Varley, Carmichael and Lismer. Robson later spoke favourably of Thomson's loyalty, calling him \\"a most diligent, reliable and capable craftsman\\". Robson's success in attracting great talent was well understood.

Summarize this article in one sentence. Yet this is just the tip of an iceberg when it comes to UK firms owned by Indian businesses. The visit to the UK by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which starts on Thursday, comes at a time when India is emerging as perhaps the strongest player among the so-called Bric nations - Brazil, Russia, India and China. While the Brazilian, Chinese and Russian economies are all showing signs of slowing, India is booming. Shielded from China's slowdown thanks to its huge domestic market, India's economy is growing at a rate of 7% per year, putting it neck and neck with the Chinese. And some of that Indian growth is finding new markets in the UK. According to a report earlier this year from government department UK Trade & Investment (UKTI), India is now the third-largest source of foreign direct investment into the UK. In 2014 alone, investment from India into the UK increased by 64%, and is now almost level with France, the UK's second-largest investor after the US. Throughout last year, India invested in 122 projects in the UK, compared with 124 for France and 564 for the US. This meant that Indian investment created 7,730 new UK jobs in 2014, and safeguarded a further 1,620, said UKTI. Meanwhile, the UK India Business Council, the non-profit body that aims to boost trade and business links between the two countries, estimates that the total value of Indian investment in the UK in the 2013 to 2014 financial year totalled £1.89bn. Overall there are now more than 800 Indian-owned businesses in the UK, employing more than 110,000 people. In addition to Tata Motors, Indian IT firms Infosys and Wipro have UK operations. Meanwhile, sister Tata business, Tata Global Beverages, owns best-selling Tetley Tea; and Tata Steel has significant UK operations, despite recently announced job cuts due to falling demand and cheaper steel from China. Alpesh Patel, of London-based private equity business Praefinium Partners, says that while the success of companies such as Tata and Infosys is well known, the quality of Indian small to medium-sized enterprises has improved significantly over the past 10 years, and many are looking to enter EU markets using the UK as their gateway. He adds that the ease of doing business in the UK, as well as the English language and familiarity with UK institutions, also makes the UK an attractive proposition for Indian investors. \\"Ease of business here is often overlooked and taken for granted,\\" says Mr Patel. \\"We're used to comparing things in absolute terms - we might say it took ages to fill in a tax return for example - but we don't compare it with the same thing in India where it really is a pain.\\" He adds that one area that particularly appeals to Indian investors is the ease with which they can raise finance in the UK. \\"They're often not looking for money from the UK to go into their company in India, but looking for UK money going into their UK operations. We really overlook the size and strength of our angel investor and venture capital community. \\"Relative to companies in India, we're seen as an absolute haven in terms of access to capital if you've got a good business.\\" Mukesh Rajani, UK India business group leader at accountancy giant PricewaterhouseCoopers, says that besides the EU, the UK's historical connections with the rest of the world, including Africa, are key in attracting Indian investment. He adds that Indian firms are also keen to tap into British hi-tech expertise. \\"Advanced engineering is a big strength for the UK,\\" says Mr Rajani. \\"High-end engineering, high-end advanced services, high-end pharmaceuticals are very interesting areas for Indian companies. \\"Clearly at the high-end what is on offer in Britain is in a different league, and these things would take time for India to develop as it acquires its own talent.\\" Richard Heald, chief executive at the UK India Business Council, says that most of the investment in the UK is in the IT sectors and driven by Mr Modi's policy of making India the world's hub for IT industries. He says: \\"A lot of the growth in indigenous Indian industries has to be sustained through technological development. \\"If Modi's policies are to succeed then it needs to have exposure and involvement with a lot of the technological development, incubation, catapult centres, upstream technology companies that we have here. \\"The Indians naturally look to us for that in the form of joint ventures, or acquisitions, or just investment.\\" Mr Heald highlights pharmaceutical firms Piramal and Cipla as two other Indian businesses that have made significant moves into the UK. 110,000 people are employed by Indian companies operating in the UK 13 Indian companies each employ more than 1,000 people in the UK 65,000 people work for Tata Group, which owns 5 of those 13 companies 28,000 of those work for Tata Motors, which owns Jaguar Land Rover But what about UK investment going into India? Between 2000 and 2015, the UK invested 22.2bn (£14.5bn) in India, accounting for around 9% of foreign direct investment in the country, according to a report by UK business group the CBI. This makes the UK the largest foreign investor in India after Singapore and Mauritius. The CBI study added that in total UK companies are estimated to employ 691,000 people in India. That is 5.5% of the organised private sector workforce. Mr Heald says: \\"We estimate that there's been a 300% increase in the number of British companies setting up there in the past 10 years… there's been a huge acceleration. \\"And the type of company is changing too - it's more e-commerce, services, IT and education.\\" Under India's federal system, individual states are now more competitive, and are seeking inbound investment by cutting red tape, and simplifying the country's notoriously arcane state tax systems. Mr Heald adds: \\"The term 'competitive federalism' is now being bandied around… these states really have to compete for the investment pound.\\"","completion":"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the UK highlights India's emergence as one of the strongest players among the BRIC nations, with the economy growing at 7% per year, and Indian businesses investing in the UK market; there are now more than 800 Indian-owned businesses in the UK, employing over 110,000 people."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Gothic fiction, which is largely known by the subgenre of Gothic horror, is a genre or mode of literature and film that combines fiction and horror, death, and at times romance. Its origin is attributed to English author Horace Walpole, with his 1764 novel \\"The Castle of Otranto\\", subtitled (in its second edition) \\"A Gothic Story.\\" The effect of Gothic fiction feeds on a pleasing sort of terror, an extension of Romantic literary pleasures that were relatively new at the time of Walpole's novel. It originated in England in the second half of the 18th century and had much success in the 19th, as witnessed by Mary Shelleys \\"Frankenstein\\" and the works of Edgar Allan Poe. Another well known novel in this genre, dating from the late Victorian era, is Bram Stokers \\"Dracula\\". The name \\"Gothic\\" refers to the (pseudo)-medieval buildings, emulating Gothic architecture, in which many of these stories take place. This extreme form of romanticism was very popular in England and Germany. The English Gothic novel also led to new novel types such as the German \\"Schauerroman\\" and the French \\"Georgia\\". - Ragnhild Westgaard Sigland (born November 13, 1976), mostly known by her stage name Nell Sigland, is a Norwegian singer from Hamar, best known as the lead vocalist of Norwegian gothic metal band Theatre of Tragedy as a replacement for Liv Kristine, from June 3, 2004 to October 2, 2010. She was also the lead singer for Norwegian gothic rock band The Crest, founded by her husband Kristian Sigland and herself. - Liv Kristine Espenæs (born 14 February 1976 in Stavanger, Norway), better known as Liv Kristine, is a singer/songwriter who has performed and composed songs mostly for various subgenres of heavy metal music. She is known for her work in close association with her then-husband and leader of the German band Atrocity, Alexander Krull. She started her career in the music industry as a vocalist for the gothic metal band Theatre of Tragedy, and is the former lead vocalist for the symphonic metal band Leaves' Eyes. - Storm is the sixth studio album by the Norwegian gothic metal band Theatre of Tragedy , released in March 2006 . It is the band 's first album with a new lead singer Nell Sigland . The song \`\` Storm '' was released as the album 's only single . The album shows something of a return to gothic metal , although its sound is much lighter and more upbeat than that of earlier albums and it still uses modern English lyrics . The band embarked on a European tour to support the release . The cover art was designed by Thomas Ewerhard , who also made the covers for Assembly and Forever Is The World . The song \`\` Senseless '' was originally titled \`\` Seven '' , as it is written in septuple meter and is the seventh track on the album . - Gothic rock (also referred to as goth rock or simply goth) is a musical subgenre of post-punk and alternative rock that formed during the late 1970s. Gothic rock bands grew from the strong ties they had to the English punk rock and emerging post-punk scenes. Proto-gothic bands include Siouxsie and the Banshees, Joy Division, Bauhaus and the Cure. - Stavanger is a city and municipality in Norway. The city is the third-largest urban zone and metropolitan area in Norway (through conurbation with neighbouring Sandnes) and the administrative centre of Rogaland county. The municipality is the fourth most populous in Norway. Located on the Stavanger Peninsula in Southwest Norway, Stavanger counts its official founding year as 1125, the year the Stavanger Cathedral was completed. Stavanger's core is to a large degree 18th- and 19th-century wooden houses that are protected and considered part of the city's cultural heritage. This has caused the town centre and inner city to retain a small-town character with an unusually high ratio of detached houses, and has contributed significantly to spreading the city's population growth to outlying parts of Greater Stavanger. - Gothic metal (or goth metal) is a fusion genre combining the heaviness of heavy metal with the dark atmospheres of gothic rock. The music of gothic metal is diverse with bands known to adopt the gothic approach to different styles of heavy metal music. The genre originated during the early 1990s in Europe originally as an outgrowth of death-doom, a fusion of death metal and doom metal. Lyrics are generally dark and introspective with inspiration from gothic fiction as well as personal experiences. - Death-doom is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal. It combines the slow tempos and pessimistic or depressive mood of doom metal with the deep growling vocals and double kick drumming of death metal. The genre emerged in the mid-1980s and gained a certain amount of popularity during the 1990s, but had become less common by the turn of the 21st century. In turn, death/doom gave rise to the closely related genre of funeral doom as well as to the more melodic and romantic gothic metal. - Doom metal is an extreme style of heavy metal music that typically uses slower tempos, low-tuned guitars and a much \\"thicker\\" or \\"heavier\\" sound than other metal genres. Both the music and the lyrics intend to evoke a sense of despair, dread, and impending doom. The genre is strongly influenced by the early work of Black Sabbath, who formed a prototype for doom metal with songs such as \\"Black Sabbath\\", \\"Children of the Grave\\", \\"Electric Funeral\\" and \\"Into the Void\\". During the first half of the 1980s, a number of bands from England (Pagan Altar, Witchfinder General), the United States (Pentagram, Saint Vitus, Trouble) and Sweden (Candlemass, Count Raven) defined doom metal as a distinct genre. - Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. It typically employs heavily distorted and low-tuned guitars, played with techniques such as palm muting and tremolo picking, deep growling vocals and screams, aggressive, powerful drumming featuring double kick or blast beat techniques, minor keys or atonality, abrupt tempo, key, and time signature changes and chromatic chord progressions. The lyrical themes of death metal may invoke slasher film-stylized violence, religion (sometimes Satanism), occultism, Lovecraftian horror, nature, mysticism, mythology, philosophy, science fiction, and politics, and they may describe extreme acts, including mutilation, dissection, torture, rape, cannibalism, and necrophilia. - Theatre of Tragedy was a Norwegian band from Stavanger, active between 1993 and 2010. They are best known for their earlier albums, which influenced the gothic metal genre. Given the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'genre'.

Premise: \\"uh-huh well that turned out to be a good game\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"It ended up being a decent team.\\"?","completion":"If the premise, \\"uh-huh well that turned out to be a good game,\\" is true, the information provided does not necessarily entail or guarantee the hypothesis \\"It ended up being a decent team.\\" There could be various factors contributing to the game ultimately being considered good, and not all of them involve a decent team. To understand this better, let's break down the possible reasons behind a game being considered 'good' and analyze their relationship to the quality of the teams involved. 1. A close and competitive match: One reason a game might be considered good is the level of competition between the teams, with both sides presenting a strong challenge to each other. If both teams were decent, then it likely contributed to the game's excitement and would, to some extent, support the hypothesis. However, it is also possible that both teams were not necessarily decent, but their skills were closely matched, creating a competitive atmosphere. 2. Exceptional individual performances: Sometimes, a game might be considered 'good' because of outstanding performances by individual players, regardless of the team's overall quality. In this case, a game could be exciting and enjoyable to watch due to these remarkable moments, even if one or both teams were not particularly strong. This indicates that the premise doesn't inherently imply a decent team. 3. Unexpected outcomes: A game can be deemed good if there were unexpected twists and turns, such as come-from-behind victories or last-minute plays that determined the outcome. These surprises can make the game memorable and entertaining but do not directly correlate to the quality of the teams involved. 4. High scoring matches: Some spectators might consider a high-scoring game to be good, regardless of the overall skill level or quality of the teams. In these cases, enjoyment might stem from the constant back-and-forth and adrenaline-filled goal-scoring moments. Again, this doesn't necessarily mean that both teams were decent; there might be faulty defenses or goalkeepers at play that led to a higher score. 5. Emotional or rivalry context: A game might be considered good because of the emotions, history, or rivalry between the teams or their fans. In these cases, the game's excitement and \\"goodness\\" might come from the intense atmosphere rather than the quality of the teams themselves. In conclusion, while a good game might indirectly suggest that the teams involved put up a decent performance, the premise does not guarantee or necessarily entail the hypothesis \\"It ended up being a decent team.\\" There are various factors that could contribute to a game being considered good, and not all of these factors depend on the quality of the teams involved. The relationship between a good game and a decent team is not a strict cause-and-effect connection, but rather a multi-factorial scenario that depends on a range of elements, such as competition, individual performances, unexpected outcomes, high-scoring matches, and emotional context."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Q: Párrafo: A medida que el noroeste de Europa comenzó a calentarse lentamente hace 22 000 años, el subsuelo congelado y los glaciares alpinos expandidos comenzaron a descongelarse y las cubiertas de nieve de otoño-invierno se derritieron en la primavera. Gran parte de la descarga se dirigió al Rin y su extensión río abajo. El rápido calentamiento y los cambios de vegetación, para abrir el bosque, comenzaron alrededor del 13 000 BP. Para el 9000 BP, Europa estaba completamente cubierta de bosques. Con la reducción global de la cubierta de hielo, los niveles de agua del océano subieron y el Canal de la Mancha y el Mar del Norte se reintegraron. El agua de deshielo, sumado al hundimiento del océano y de la tierra, ahogó las antiguas costas de Europa de manera desproporcionada. Question: ¿Cuándo empezó a calentarse lentamente Europa desde la última Edad de Hielo? A:","completion":"22 000 años"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. This film was recommended to me by a friend who lives in California. She thought it was wonderful because it was so real, \\"Just the way people in the Ohio Valley are!\\" I'm from the area and I experienced the film as \\"Just the way people in California think we are!\\" I've lived in Marietta and Parkersburg and worked minimum wage jobs there. We laughed a lot, we bonded with and took breaks with people our own age; the young people went out together at night. The older people had little free time after work because they were taking care of their families. The area is beautiful in the summer and no gloomier in the winter rain than anywhere else. Aside from the \\"if you live in a manufactured home you must be depressed\\" condescension, the story lacked any elements of charm, mystery or even a sense of dread. Martha's character was the worst drawn. It's doubtful that anyone so repressed would have belonged to a church, but if she had, she probably would have made friends there. I've read reviews that seem to assume Martha was jealous of Rose because Rose was \\"younger, prettier and thinner\\" but if this is the case it isn't shown. All we actually see is Martha learning to dislike Rose for reasons that would apply just as much if the three friends had been the same age and gender. We see Martha feeling left out during smoking sessions, left out of the loop when social plans are made, used but not appreciated, and finally disrespected and hurt.

Q: To assess if titration of sevoflurane using the bispectral index (BIS) monitor improves the early and intermediate recovery in geriatric outpatients undergoing brief urologic procedures under general anesthesia without muscle relaxants.', 'After a standardized induction with propofol and fentanyl, a laryngeal mask airway was inserted and sevoflurane was administered in combination with 60% nitrous oxide in oxygen for maintenance of anesthesia in spontaneously breathing outpatients. In the Control group (n = 25), sevoflurane and fentanyl were titrated according to standard clinical practice. In the BIS-directed group (n = 25), sevoflurane was titrated to maintain a BIS value between 50 and 60, and supplemental fentanyl, 25 mug iv boluses were administered to treat tachypnea.

Duke Ellington was known for his innovative contributions to jazz music and his ability to adapt to diverse styles throughout his career.

Most of the townspeople are victims of tobacco-related diseases, including Emma's own father, who recently passed away due to lung cancer.

He and my mother had danced to the Miller band at Glen Island Casino on Long Island Sound in the summer of 1942, when they were both sixteen.

While iterating, check the current index. If the index is less than the calculated index, append the current element to the new list B. 5. In our example, - At index 0, we have 'p'. Since 0 < 19, we append 'p' to B. - At index 1, we have 'v'. Since 1 < 19, we append 'v' to B. - ... - At index 18, we have '3349'. Since 18 < 19, we append '3349' to B. - At index 19, we have 'w'. Since 19 is not less than 19, we don't append 'w' to B. - At index 20, we have 'L'. Since 20 is not less than 19, we don't append 'L' to B. 6.

Given these facts, what are encoded with instructions that tell cells what to do among the following options: - heat or cold - sensory neurons - a delta - gene segments - A Greek letter - to move people - lie detectors - Electrical energy","completion":"Among the given options, \\"gene segments\\" are encoded with instructions that tell cells what to do. A detailed explanation is provided below: 1. Heat or cold: Heat and cold are physical temperature sensations that can have an effect on cells and organisms. They are not encoded with instructions that tell cells what to do but can lead to specific cellular responses depending on the conditions. 2. Sensory neurons: Sensory neurons are a type of nerve cell that transmit signals from sensory organs (such as skin, eyes, ears, tongue, and nose) to the brain, where the information is then processed. While sensory neurons are responsible for transmitting information about the external environment to cells, they themselves are not encoded with instructions that tell cells what to do. 3. A delta: A delta is a landform created by the deposition of sediment carried by a river as the flow leaves its mouth and enters slower-moving or stagnant water. This geographical feature is not related to the encoding of instructions for cellular processes. 4. Gene segments: Gene segments are specific regions of DNA molecules that carry genetic information. They are indeed encoded with instructions that tell cells what to do. These instructions translate into the formation of proteins, which then carry out specific functions within the cell, such as providing structure or facilitating chemical reactions. 5. A Greek letter: Greek letters are symbols used in various fields such as mathematics, science, and engineering to represent specific values or concepts. They are not related to cellular instructions and do not contain information that directs cell function. 6. To move people: Moving people refers to the action of transporting individuals from one location to another. This concept is not related to the encoding of instructions within cells and does not have a direct influence on cellular processes. 7. Lie detectors: Lie detectors, or polygraphs, are devices used to measure physiological responses such as heart rate, blood pressure, and skin conductivity, to help determine whether a person is being truthful or lying. This technology is not related to the encoding of cellular instructions that direct cell function. 8. Electrical energy: Electrical energy is a form of energy resulting from the existence of charged particles (such as electrons or protons), either statically or as a current. Some cellular processes, like the transmission of nerve impulses, involve electrical energy. However, electrical energy itself is not encoded with instructions that tell cells what to do. In summary, among the options provided, gene segments are the only category directly involved with encoding instructions that tell cells what to do. These segments of DNA molecules carry genetic information that is essential for the formation and function of proteins within cells, ultimately determining an organism's characteristics, growth, development, and overall cellular processes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Having ridden out of the city through the Saint-Denis Gate, he now was nearly home, and the hurt inside was cutting so deep that he thought it would drive him mad. He repeated again and again the pledge he had just made to Nicolette: I am your true troubadour, now and forever. It felt like a knife stabbing into him. I do love her, as I have not loved any other - except Diane. Under his fur-lined mantle he was sweating, despite the bone-deep chill of the January night. Was my pledge to Nicolette a lie? No, not now that Diane has vowed herself to God. He had always believed that a man or a woman could love but one person. For all the years he had loved Diane, he had accepted that as a sacred law of Love. It was the way things should be. But it was not the way they were. Not for him. What if I had known, that day I saw Nicolette at Chinon, that Diane was still alive? I would have wanted Nicolette just as much, but would not have begun this. There would have been no messages, no song in her garden. But I was sure Diane was dead. There was nothing but a memory of a younger time to check my feelings for Nicolette. And then, when I found Diane again, I could not have her. I had lost her forever. So at last I wrote again to Nicolette. But tonight, when Nicolette would have let me make love to her - and how I want her! - I could not go beyond an embrace and a kiss. Not as long as I still love Diane.

A catcall could be whistling at, making kissing sounds at, or lobbing uninvited comments in a woman’s direction while she is walking about, minding her own business. “Hey, beautiful,” or “What are you doing later, sweetheart?” are examples of comments you should keep to yourself. If you see an attractive woman walking around, go about your business and leave her alone. Don’t leer. Don’t make that gaping-mouthed, wide-eyed caveman face. If a woman is walking towards you, do not assume it is because she wants to talk to you. She has somewhere to be and should be allowed to reach her destination without being subjected to your unwanted gaze. Staring is creepy, irritating, and gross for the woman in question. If you feel your eyes fixating on someone, just close your eyes or look away. When you’re in a bar or club, sexual harassment often takes the form of unwanted touching or groping. When alcohol is involved, the likelihood that women will be confronted with unwanted sexual attention increases. Understand that just as you have a right to dance and drink in public without being accosted, so to do women. If they rebuff your advances or are unreceptive to your invitations to drink and dance, do not try to coerce them by grabbing them by the arm, around the waist, or engaging in other forms of unwanted touching. Be respectful of women’s wishes and demands at all times. If you find liquor leads you to sexually harass women, try drinking at home with your friends. The most infamous of this category are so-called “blonde jokes,” whose punchline always drives home that women with blonde hair are stupid. This kind of gendered humor constitutes sexual harassment. Other jokes about women revolve around a variety of other traits traditionally considered feminine, such as cooking, cleaning, or caring for children. If a joke is at the expense of a woman’s integrity or feelings, don’t tell it. There are plenty of funny jokes which don’t turn women into the punchline. Misogynists and male chauvinists see no problem with sexual harassment. They think it is their right to touch or talk about women in whatever ways they want. By being with them, you are more likely to internalize and tacitly approve this behavior as acceptable. But when you choose not go out with them, you can take the opportunity to explain that you’re doing so in order to work towards a new life built on respect for, empathy with, and understanding of women. Hopefully your example will make them consider their behavior too. Be firm when expressing your disdain for harassment. Look your friends in the eye so they know you are not joking. Examples of things you can say to chastise your male chauvinist friends include: How would you like it if people treated you like an object? She's not a dog, don't whistle at her.
