Given the question: This article: The backstory takes place in 12th century England, where Lord Thibault Malféte is about to marry Princess Rosalind, the daughter of the reigning King. At the wedding banquet, by mistake, an enemy known as the Earl of Warwick gives Thibault a potion which makes him hallucinate (and which was actually intended for Rosalind by a witch hired and paid by the Earl), and under its influence, he kills his own bride (rather than her father, as in the French version) believing she is a ferocious monster. While under sentence of death, he asks his servant, André Le Paté to find a wizard to help him. The wizard gives him a potion that will send him back to the moment before he killed Princess Rosalind. The incompetent wizard botches the spell, and instead, Thibault and Andre are sent into the 21st century. They end up in a museum in Chicago where they are arrested by the police. They are rescued by Julia Malféte, a museum employee who closely resembles Princess Rosalind. She thinks that Thibault is her distant French cousin who drowned while yachting a couple of years ago. Thibault soon finds out that Julia is descended from his family and realizes he must return to the 12th century to correct the past. Julia introduces them to the modern American style of life where norms from medieval times no longer apply.

In addition, Democrats cheered a turnout that could have major implications for next year's congressional midterm elections, when all 435 House seats and one-third of the Senate will be on the ballot. Democrats are pointing to exit polls in both Virginia and New Jersey that showed that anger at Trump was a major factor in stimulating Democrats to get to the polls. They also note Democratic gains in the battle for state delegate seats in Virginia, another sign of grass-roots enthusiasm that could help Democrats in races for lower-level offices across the country. In New Jersey, Governor-elect Phil Murphy, a Democrat, saw his election as a direct rebuke of the Republican president. \\"New Jersey sent an unmistakable message to the entire nation. We are better than this!\\" Murphy told cheering supporters at his victory rally. In Virginia, Democrat Ralph Northam defeated Republican Ed Gillespie in a campaign that focused, in part, on Trump and his policies, especially on immigration. At a news conference Wednesday, Northam said his victory showed that Virginians had a message for the country and the world. \\"The divisiveness, the hatred, the bigotry, the politics that is tearing this country apart, that is not the United States of America that people love and it certainly not the Commonwealth of Virginia that they love,\\" he said. Political analysts said Democratic enthusiasm and a focus on Trump were clearly on display in both states. \\"We have heard for months and months about all this energy on the left. It had not materialized until tonight,\\" said Steve Peoples of the Associated Press. \\"A big night for Democrats and, really, it was a repudiation of sorts of the Trump nationalist message.\\" Even some Republicans saw the results as a rejection of the Trump political brand.

Then trace the window's shape using a sharpie; afterwards use a ruler to make this outline a few mm narrower and shorter to make sure the window is a snug fit. The other answer, suggesting to just eyeball the cut, is not the best way because it leaves room for error and might result in uneven or misaligned cuts. Additionally, simply filling any gaps with epoxy and silicone is not as secure as having a snug-fitting window, and can potentially lead to leaks or other problems in the future. By applying masking tape and carefully tracing the shape of the window, you ensure a more accurate and precise cut, which reduces the likelihood of encountering issues after installation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In the Kenya-Tanzania border Kenyan grassland gradually merges into Tanzanian forest. Though they had similar soil to start with millions of years ago, today they are two different habitats. At present, Kenya has one of the largest contiguous grassland in Africa. On the other hand, Tanzania boasts one of the largest forest cover in Africa. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would Kenya have less or more organic matter stored in the \\"O horizon\\" than Tanzania? Hint: In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon.

The story is set during the Napoleonic Wars and revolves around two sisters, Phoebe and Susan Throssel, who fall in love with the same man, Dr. Valentine Brown. When Brown leaves to serve as a soldier, news of his purported engagement to a beautiful heiress breaks Phoebe's heart. To regain his attention, Phoebe creates a younger, flirtatious alter ego, \\"Miss Livvy,\\" which leads to various complications and ultimately a happy resolution for the sisters. The transition from stage to screen took place in 1937 with the release of the film adaptation, directed by George Stevens. The movie starred Katharine Hepburn as Phoebe Throssel, Franchot Tone as Valentine Brown, and Fay Bainter as Susan Throssel. The film makes use of the features and techniques available in cinema to enrich the storytelling, offering viewers a visual representation of the characters, settings, and emotions that were originally crafted for live theater. The film earned both critical acclaim and commercial success in its time. J.M. Barrie’s wide-ranging body of work cemented his reputation as a skilled playwright and storyteller, but it is undoubtedly his creation of Peter Pan, the boy who wouldn't grow up, that has left the most enduring impact on popular culture. First introduced in the 1902 novel The Little White Bird, Peter Pan eventually became the protagonist of Barrie's most famous play, Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up, written in 1904. This was later adapted into the novel Peter and Wendy in 1911. Peter Pan explores themes of childhood, innocence, and the fleeting nature of time while continuing to inspire numerous adaptations, sequels, and reinterpretations in literature, film, television, and theater. In summary, the 1937 period film Quality Street was based on the 1901 play of the same name by the illustrious Scottish novelist and playwright J.M. Barrie. While Barrie may be best remembered for his creation of Peter Pan, his other works like Quality Street demonstrate his mastery of storytelling, engaging characters, and the exploration of deeper themes and emotions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Predict the sentiment of this tweet.","completion":"The sentiment of this tweet can be described as a mixture of negative emotions, mainly annoyance and pain, with a touch of humor. Let me break this down further: 1. Negative emotions: The user is clearly expressing their discomfort by stating that they've been hit in the face with a bouncy ball, followed by the interjection \\"OUCH.\\" This communicates that the experience was unpleasant and painful. Additionally, they mention \\"curse my brother,\\" suggesting annoyance or frustration with their sibling who is presumably responsible for the incident. 2. Humor: Despite the negative emotions being communicated, the tweet also possesses a light-hearted undertone. The use of multiple exclamation points, the casual tone, and the mention of a bouncy ball (instead of a more dangerous object) imply that the situation is not extremely serious or harmful, and that the user is willing to laugh about it. This adds a humorous element to the tweet, showing that even though they are upset, the user can still view the incident in a lighthearted manner. In conclusion, the sentiment of this tweet is primarily negative due to the user's expression of pain and annoyance. However, the addition of a humorous element indicates that the user is not deeply upset by the incident and can still find some amusement in the situation. This makes the overall sentiment a blend of negative emotions and humor."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Context: It was a made-for-TV moment that all presidents would relish, but it seemed especially significant for the man who turned a reality TV career into a successful bid for the presidency. Donald Trump triumphantly greeted the three Americans released by North Korea in the early morning darkness at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington early Thursday, an image one can expect to see over and over again come the 2020 U.S. presidential election campaign. “It was a very important thing to all of us to be able to get these three great people out,” Trump told reporters on the tarmac. He then went on to speculate that live television coverage of the arrival “probably broke the all-time in history television rating for 3 o’clock in the morning.” It was a moment the president gladly seized given that his White House has been buffeted by a chaotic mix of policy and personal drama in recent days. The prospect of a potentially historic breakthrough on North Korea could move a number of other unwelcome distractions to the side, including the ongoing Russia investigation, the growing legal difficulties for Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, and the soap opera that the Stormy Daniels story has become. Daniels is the adult film actress who claims she once had an affair with Trump. He denies the claim. Trump also announced Thursday on Twitter that he will meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on June 12 in Singapore. A new CNN poll found that 77 percent of those surveyed support Trump meeting the North Korean leader, and 53 percent approve of his handling of the North Korea issue generally. Those numbers are in keeping with a general trend of late that has seen the president’s poll ratings improving, perhaps in part because of the strong economy. Question: What is likely true about President Trump? Options: A. He is not bothered or nervous about the controversies he is currently experiencing during his presidency. B. not enough information C.

First question: Which is the best phone to buy under 15000? In the price range of under 15000, there are several phones that you can consider. However, the best phone will depend on your personal preferences and requirements. These include factors such as performance, camera quality, battery life, and software experience. Some of the best available options in this price segment are: 1. POCO X3: The POCO X3 offers a 120Hz refresh rate display, Snapdragon 732G processor, 6000mAh battery, and a quad-camera setup on the back. 2. Realme 8: The Realme 8 comes with a MediaTek Helio G95 processor, 64MP AI quad-camera, and a 5000mAh battery with 30W fast charging support. 3.

The top options remain: 1. POCO X3 2. Realme 8 3. Samsung Galaxy M32 4. Redmi Note 10 These devices are currently among the best Android smartphones available in the market for under ₹15000. Now, are these two questions asking the same thing? Option [ii] yes. While the first question asks for the best phone under 15000, it does not specifically mention that it should be an Android device. However, in the given price range, the vast majority of available options are Android smartphones.

Exorcist John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) was born with the power to see angels and demons. At age 15, he committed suicide to escape his visions, but he was revived after spending two minutes in Hell, though John explains that since time moves differently in Hell 2 minutes feels like a full lifetime. Consequently, his soul is bound for Hell when he dies for the sin of taking his own life. John exorcises a girl possessed by a soldier demon trying to break through to Earth, something that should not be possible, as demons cannot take their true physical form on the mortal plane. John seeks an audience with the androgynous half-breed angel Gabriel (Tilda Swinton). He asks Gabriel for a reprieve from his impending death from lung cancer; but Gabriel declines, telling John that his motives for exorcising demons are selfish and will not earn him entry into Heaven.

The 22nd film, previously known only as \\"Bond 22\\", will be called \\"Quantum of Solace\\". EON Productions who are producing the film made the announcement today at Pinewood Studios, where production for the film has been under way since last year. The name of the film was inspired by a short story (of the same name) from For Your Eyes Only by Bond creator, Ian Fleming. Can we infer the following? The name was based on a short story by Ian Fleming.","completion":"Yes, we can infer that the name of the 22nd James Bond film, \\"Quantum of Solace,\\" was based on a short story by Bond creator Ian Fleming. The eponymous short story was part of the collection titled \\"For Your Eyes Only,\\" which comprises various narratives featuring the iconic British secret agent James Bond. EON Productions, the company responsible for producing the Bond films, made the announcement regarding the film's title at Pinewood Studios, where the movie had been in production since the previous year. The decision to derive the title from a short story within Ian Fleming's work is a homage to the original source material and demonstrates the filmmakers' intention to draw inspiration from the essence of the Bond character that Fleming created. By connecting the film to the literary origins of James Bond, the choice of title also serves to reinforce the relationship between the movie series and its roots, potentially attracting both new and old fans of the franchise. The \\"Quantum of Solace\\" short story itself is not a typical action-oriented Bond narrative but rather an introspective exploration of empathy and human relationships. The story focuses on a conversation about the importance of a \\"quantum of solace,\\" meaning a minimal level of comfort and reassurance, as a fundamental requirement for healthy relationships. The incorporation of this subtle yet powerful theme into the storyline of the film suggests a more nuanced and layered portrayal of the James Bond character than seen in previous adaptations. By choosing this title for the 22nd film in the series, EON Productions and the creative team behind \\"Quantum of Solace\\" may have been signaling a certain level of depth, character development, and narrative complexity that could add an additional dimension to the longstanding James Bond film series. This could indicate that, while the contemporary Bond may be engaged in extraordinary situations and intense action sequences typical of the franchise, the film may also delve into intriguing themes derived from Ian Fleming's literary work."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the person that composed the four-act \\"drame lyricque\\", Le timbre d'argent?, using the article: For a French composer of the 19th century, opera was seen as the most important type of music. Saint-Saëns's younger contemporary and rival, Massenet, was beginning to gain a reputation as an operatic composer, but Saint-Saëns, with only the short and unsuccessful La princesse jaune staged, had made no mark in that sphere. In February 1877, he finally had a full-length opera staged. His four-act \\"drame lyricque\\", Le timbre d'argent (\\"The Silver Bell\\"), to Jules Barbier's and Michel Carré's libretto, reminiscent of the Faust legend, had been in rehearsal in 1870, but the outbreak of war halted the production. The work was eventually presented by the Théâtre Lyrique company of Paris; it ran for eighteen performances.The dedicatee of the opera, Albert Libon, died three months after the premiere, leaving Saint-Saëns a large legacy \\"To free him from the slavery of the organ of the Madeleine and to enable him to devote himself entirely to composition\\". Saint-Saëns, unaware of the imminent bequest, had resigned his position shortly before his friend died. He was not a conventional Christian, and found religious dogma increasingly irksome; he had become tired of the clerical authorities' interference and musical insensitivity; and he wanted to be free to accept more engagements as a piano soloist in other cities. After this he never played the organ professionally in a church service, and rarely played the instrument at all. He composed a Messe de Requiem in memory of his friend, which was performed at Saint-Sulpice to mark the first anniversary of Libon's death; Charles-Marie Widor played the organ and Saint-Saëns conducted. In December 1877, Saint-Saëns had a more solid operatic success, with Samson et Dalila, his one opera to gain and keep a place in the international repertoire.

Although the publicity generated by Five Leaves Left was minor, Boyd was keen to build on what momentum there was. Drake's second album, 1971's Bryter Layter, again produced by Boyd and engineered by John Wood, introduced a more upbeat, jazzier sound.Disappointed by his debut's poor commercial performance, Drake sought to move away from his pastoral sound, and agreed to Boyd's suggestions to include bass and drum tracks. \\"It was more of a pop sound, I suppose,\\" Boyd later said. \\"I imagined it as more commercial.\\" Like its predecessor, the album featured musicians from Fairport Convention, as well as contributions from John Cale on two songs: \\"Northern Sky\\" and \\"Fly\\". Trevor Dann noted that while sections of \\"Northern Sky\\" sound more characteristic of Cale, the song was the closest Drake came to a release with chart potential. Cale used heroin during this period, and his older friend Brian Wells suspected that Drake was also using.Boyd and Wood were confident that Bryter Layter would be a success, but it sold fewer than 3,000 copies. Reviews were again mixed: while Record Mirror praised Drake as a \\"beautiful guitarist—clean and with perfect timing, [and] accompanied by soft, beautiful arrangements\\", Melody Maker described the album as \\"an awkward mix of folk and cocktail jazz\\".Soon after its release, Boyd sold Witchseason to Island Records, and moved to Los Angeles to work with Warner Brothers to develop film soundtracks.

News article: A DECISION by an Islamic seminary for women to name its library after former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden has caused a controversy in Pakistan's capital. Maulana Abdul Aziz of the Red Mosque, known for its alleged links to militant groups, renamed the school's existing library Maktbah Usama bin Laden Shaheed - Urdu for Osama bin Laden, the martyr. Aziz said the main objective of the initiative was to show \\"respect\\" for bin Laden. \\"He is our hero, and we do not care if the world calls him a terrorist,\\" the cleric said. The library is situated in the centre of Islamabad, about half a kilometre from the headquarters of Pakistan's intelligence agency, which has been accused of protecting the former al-Qaeda chief before he was killed by the US military in 2011 during a raid in Pakistan. Commentators have referred to the renaming of the library as inappropriate and have branded it an embarrassment for the government and its security institutions, which have come under fire for failing to curb the activities of extremist groups. \\"It is a huge embarrassment,\\" security expert Hasan Askari Rizvi said. \\"It shows that the government is confused, and it does not have a clear policy towards the groups who cherish al-Qaeda ideology.\\" ||||| ISLAMABAD (AP) — Most didn't notice the new library at this Islamic seminary for girls near Pakistan's capital, until locals saw the paper sign in Urdu posted on its wooden door: \\"Library of Osama bin Laden, the Martyr.\\" Maulana Abdul Aziz, left, head cleric of a Pakistani seminary, talks to visitor in a library named after slain al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden, Friday, April 18, 2014 in Islamabad, Pakistan. A controversial... (Associated Press) Cleric Maulana Abdul Aziz, a radical preacher who runs the Jamia Hafsa madrassa, wanted to honor the memory of the al-Qaida leader, killed in a May 2011 raid by U.S. Navy SEALs on his hiding place in Abbottabad, a garrison town about 125 kilometers (75 miles) north of the capital, Islamabad. But while the library's name has garnered attention across Pakistan, a country where public opinion remains strongly anti-American and religious students today still idolize the man behind the Sept. 11 terror attacks, his image increasingly has faded from public view in recent years. As Pakistan has seen thousands killed in its own war against its local Taliban, a public that once named its own children after the Saudi millionaire has grown increasingly angry with militant violence. Pictures of bin Laden and stores bearing his name once dotted the countryside of Pakistan, where U.S. drone strikes against militants have grown increasingly unpopular over civilian casualties. Islamists held small rallies across Pakistan after the raid to denounce his killing, which embarrassed the country's military for not detecting it. The slain al-Qaida chief is still regarded as a hero by most students at Islamic schools, or madrassas. But this image spread as a symbol in part because at the beginning of the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, many supported the Taliban there. But since there were no images of its leader, Mullah Omar, they adopted the bearded images of bin Laden instead. As Pakistani authorities began arresting Taliban leaders and associates of bin Laden, the public grew increasingly scared about showing his image. Those that remained up slowly faded away in the sun or washed away in torrential, seasonal rains. Aziz's naming of the library is the first public remembrance of bin Laden in some time, capturing the attention of local media. For Aziz, bin Laden is an icon, the cleric's spokesman Tehsin Ullah told The Associated Press on Friday. \\"Aziz thinks that Osama bin Laden is a hero and he is a martyr and that is why he selected Osama bin Laden's name for the library,\\" Ullah said. The madrassas are an important aspect of education in the predominantly Muslim Pakistan, and tens of thousands of students study there. Most of the religious schools provide free food, tuition and even board for students who come from other parts of the country. Some also serve to radicalize youth to join militants. Aziz's students have joined anti-American protests put on by the hard-line cleric. Aziz is a prayer leader at Islamabad's Red Mosque — a former militant hideout that the army on orders from then-President Pervez Musharraf raided in 2007. The raid killed dozens of extremists and others and unleashed a wave of retaliatory militant attacks across Pakistan. Aziz was arrested by police during the raid when he tried to escape wearing a burqa. Later freed, he began running a boy's and girl's school connected to the mosque. The newly constructed, one-room library is located inside the school compound, next to a computer room and Aziz's office. There were no visible books or portraits of bin Laden inside the library when Associated Press journalists visited Friday. Abdul Rehman, the school's administrator, said it only will carry books about the teachings of Islam. Rehman refused to discuss bin Laden, saying girls at the school also learned computer skills. However, Rehman stopped journalists from speaking to students, saying Islam doesn't allow men who are not family members to interact with female students or teachers. ___ Associated Press writers Riaz Khan in Peshawar, Pakistan, and Rebecca Santana contributed to this report. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"A school for girls in Pakistan decided to name its library after Osama bin Laden, a man who was once the leader of a group called al-Qaeda.

This is hard to do in a world with so many competing demands. Good parents consciously plan and devote time to parenting. They make developing their child’s character their top priority. Once you're a parent, you have to learn to put your priorities below your children's, and to make the sacrifice. Of course, you shouldn't neglect yourself completely, but you should get accustomed to the idea of putting your child's needs first. If you have a spouse, then you can take turns caring for the child so each of you can have some \\"me time.\\" When you plan your weekly routine, your child's needs should be your primary focus. Try to unplug from the digital world and other non-familial obligations when you're spending time with your children. Your 15 year old will particular appreciate this. Helping to nurture a love for the written word will help your child to develop a love for reading later on. Set a time for reading for your child every day -- typically around bedtime or nap time. Spend at least half an hour to an hour reading to your child each day, if not more. Not only will your child develop a love for words, but your child will have a better chance of both academic and behavioral success. Studies show that children that were read to on a daily basis demonstrate less bad behavior in school. Once your child starts learning to read or write, let your child take over. Don't correct his or her mistakes every two seconds, or your child will get discouraged. It's fine to reread your child's favorite stories. This can help them develop fluency if your child enjoys what you're reading. One of the most dangerous trends in the modern family is the dying of the family meal. The dinner table is not only a place of sustenance and family business but also a place for the teaching and passing on of our values. Manners and rules are subtly absorbed over the table. Family mealtime should communicate and sustain ideals that children will draw on throughout their lives. If your child is a picky eater, don't spend dinner time criticizing your child's eating habits and watching what he or she doesn't eat like a hawk. This will lead your child to have a negative association with family meals. Get your child involved in the meal. Dinner will be more fun if your child \\"helps\\" you pick out food at the grocery store or helps you set up the table or to do small food-related tasks, such as washing the vegetables you will cook. An older child can obviously handle more than vegetable washing. Involve all the family in menu planning for the family. Keep dinner conversation open and light. Don't give your child the third-degree. Simply ask, \\"How was your day?\\" This is also the time to model sharing details about your day. Doing so will help you get more detailed information from your child without being overbearing. Try serving family-style meals, where your children get to choose portions and what meal components are on their plate. This is a great chance to teach them healthy eating habits that can last a lifetime. Though your child doesn't have to go to bed during the same five-minute stretch every single night, you should set a bedtime routine that your child can follow and stick to it. Studies show that children's cognitive abilities can drop two full grade levels after just one missed hour of sleep, so it's important that they get as much rest as they can before you send them to school. Your routine should include some winding-down time. Turn off the TV, music, or any electronics, and either talk to your child softly in bed or read to them. Don't give your child sugary snacks right before bed or it'll be harder to get them to sleep. Though you don't have to sign your child up for ten different activities each week, you should find at least one or two activities that your child loves to do and incorporate them into your child's weekly routine. This can be anything from soccer to art class -- it really doesn't matter, as long as your child shows a talent or a love for something. Tell your child what a great job he's doing and encourage him to keep going. Taking your child to different lessons will also help him or her socialize with other children. Don't get lazy. If your child complains that she doesn't want to go to piano lessons, but you know she likes it deep down, don't give in just because you don't feel like driving over there. \\"Play time\\" does not mean having your child sit in front of the TV and suck on a building block while you do the dishes. \\"Play time\\" means letting your child sit in his room or play area and to actively engage with stimulating toys while you help him explore their possibilities. Though you may be tired, it's important that you show your child the benefits of playing with his toys so he gets the stimulation he needs and so he learns to play with them on his own. It doesn't matter if you don't have 80 million toys for your child to play with. It's the quality, not the quantity of the toys that counts. And you may find that your child's favorite toy of the month is an empty toilet paper roll.","completion":"This article emphasizes the importance of prioritizing a child's needs, maintaining consistent routines, and engaging in interactive activities to support their overall development, academic and behavioral success, and long-lasting family bonds."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The soft sediment helps to preserve the remains, while the water protects them from scavengers and disturbances that can damage the remains. As more layers of sediment build up over the remains, the pressure from the overlying layers compresses the sediments, preserving the original shape and structure of the remains. As decomposition takes place, the organic components of the remains break down, leaving behind trace amounts of the original material. Over time, these traces are replaced by minerals that seep into the remains through groundwater and chemical processes. This gradual replacement of organic material with minerals leads to the formation of a fossil. If more animals die and sink underwater, it will result in more fossil formation. This is because the process of fossilization tends to be more effective underwater, where remains can be rapidly covered with sediment, preventing disturbances from natural factors such as wind, weather, and scavengers. Additionally, underwater conditions often create anaerobic (low-oxygen) environments that slow the decomposition rate, allowing for better preservation of the remains and increasing their chances of becoming fossilized. However, it is essential to note that not all remains that end up underwater will eventually become fossils. Factors like the rate of sedimentation, the nature of the surrounding environment, and the type of species dying and being buried in the sediment all play a role in determining how many fossils will be formed. But overall, an increase in animals dying and sinking underwater would likely increase the likelihood of more fossils forming."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Some foods that humans eat, such as corn and peas, are actually seeds from plants. What best describes the role of humans in a food web containing these plants?","completion":"In the context of a food web containing plants like corn and peas, humans play the role of primary consumers, secondary consumers, and ecosystem influencers. It is important to understand the concept of a food web and how it illustrates the complex interactions between different living organisms at various trophic levels in an ecosystem. A food web consists of multiple food chains, which depict the transfer of energy through the consumption of one organism by another. In a typical food web, there are primary producers, primary consumers, secondary consumers, tertiary consumers, and decomposers. Primary producers, such as corn and pea plants, are autotrophs that convert sunlight, water, and nutrients into food energy through photosynthesis. These plants produce seeds as a means of reproduction, and humans consume these seeds in the form of food. As primary consumers, humans directly consume the plants' seeds. The role of humans in this case is closer to that of herbivores in the food chain, like rabbits, deer, or insects that feed on plant matter. By consuming the seeds, humans gain the energy that was stored by the primary producers. However, humans can also be secondary consumers, depending on the type of diet they follow. For example, if a human consumes chicken that has been fed with corn or peas, the human is acting as a secondary consumer. In this case, the energy is channeled from the primary producer (the corn or pea plant) to the primary consumer (the chicken), and finally to the secondary consumer (the human). As ecosystem influencers, humans impact the growth and population size of these plants and other organisms in the food web. This influence occurs through various agricultural practices, such as farming, irrigation, and the use of pesticides, as well as other human activities like deforestation, urbanization, and industrial pollution. These human-induced changes can lead to the alteration of natural habitats, availability of resources, and distribution of species, thereby affecting the overall equilibrium of the food web. In summary, humans play a multifaceted role in a food web containing corn and pea plants. They act as primary consumers by directly consuming these plants' seeds and as secondary consumers when they consume organisms that have fed on corn and peas. However, their influence extends beyond simple consumption, as humans also have a significant impact on the ecosystem through various practices and activities that shape the structure of the food web and the interconnectedness of its organisms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The final result is a staggering accomplishment of comic-book style animation, aesthetically similar to what Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller achieved with 'Sin City (2005),' but this film employed motion capture with live-actors to translate their faces and movements into an entirely animated format. Presented in stark black-and-white, the film looks as though it has been hoisted from the very pages of the graphic novel on which it was based, and the futuristic city of Paris looms ominously above us. Directed by French filmmaker Christian Volckman, in his feature-length debut, 'Renaissance' draws significantly from other films in the science-fiction genre, and the tech-noir storyline isn't something we haven't seen before, but, from a technical standpoint, it is faultless. The year is 2054. The city of Paris is a crumbling metropolis filled with dark alleys and deserted footpaths, the recent installation of modern technology merely offering a thin mask to the pitiable degradation of the darkened buildings. The city's largest corporation, Avalon, achieved wealth through offering citizens the promise of beauty and youth, and the company's research department is continually striving to invent greater means of eliminating the aging process. Ilona Tasuiev (voiced by Romola Garai in the English-language version, which I watched) , a brilliant young scientist, is mysteriously kidnapped on her return from work, and so it falls to legendary detective Barthélémy Karas (Daniel Craig) to uncover her current whereabouts. Possibly holding the key to the woman's disappearance is Bislane (Catherine McCormack), Ilona's hardened elder sister, whose trustworthiness is in question, and Jonas Muller (Ian Holm), the dedicated medical doctor who adored Ilona as his own daughter. The eerie, dimly-lit city of Paris is reminiscent of Ridley Scott's 'Blade Runner (1982),' and some of the technology looks as though it might have been borrowed from Tom Cruise in 'Minority Report (2002)' {which was, coincidentally, also set in the year 2054}. However, despite this familiarity, Volckman has created an exciting world for his characters to inhabit. Blending classic film-noir and science-fiction, the result is an eye-catching collage of harsh lighting and dark shadows, which, I should warn, occasionally becomes difficult on the viewer's eyes. The dialogue is a little banal at times, and the story, though engaging, doesn't offer anything strikingly original {except for the ending, which I thought was a bold twist on the usual formula}, but 'Renaissance' is intended to work best as a visual treat, and that it succeeds in this regard cannot be denied.","completion":"[+] positive"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who joined the Party, which promoted several articles he did not write denouncing individualism in music that were published in Pravda under his name? ? The year 1960 marked another turning point in Shostakovich's life: he joined the Communist Party. The government wanted to appoint him General Secretary of the Composers' Union, but in order to hold that position he was required to attain Party membership. It was understood that Nikita Khrushchev, the First Secretary of the Communist Party from 1953 to 1964, was looking for support from the leading ranks of the intelligentsia in an effort to create a better relationship with the Soviet Union's artists. This event has been interpreted variously as a show of commitment, a mark of cowardice, the result of political pressure, or his free decision. On the one hand, the apparat was undoubtedly less repressive than it had been before Stalin's death. On the other, his son recalled that the event reduced Shostakovich to tears, and he later told his wife Irina that he had been blackmailed. Lev Lebedinsky has said that the composer was suicidal. From 1962, he served as a delegate in the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. Once he joined the Party, several articles he did not write denouncing individualism in music were published in Pravda under his name. In joining the party, Shostakovich was also committing himself to finally writing the homage to Lenin that he had promised before. His Twelfth Symphony, which portrays the Bolshevik Revolution and was completed in 1961, was dedicated to Vladimir Lenin and called \\"The Year 1917.\\" Around this time, his health began to deteriorate. Shostakovich's musical response to these personal crises was the Eighth String Quartet, composed in only three days. He subtitled the piece \\"To the victims of fascism and war\\", ostensibly in memory of the Dresden fire bombing that took place in 1945. Yet, like the Tenth Symphony, this quartet incorporates quotations from several of his past works and his musical monogram. Shostakovich confessed to his friend Isaak Glikman, \\"I started thinking that if some day I die, nobody is likely to write a work in memory of me, so I had better write one myself.\\"... Answer:","completion":"The last name of the person who joined the Party, which promoted several articles he did not write denouncing individualism in music that were published in Pravda under his name, is Shostakovich."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Assess the review content: The reviewer mentions the product is impossible to install without causing damage to their car. This indicates the product may have flaws in its design or compatibility with the car. 3. Consider the reviewer's experience with installation: The review also states that no car shop would install the product because it is considered \\"junk.\\" This suggests that even professionals are unwilling to work with this product, which is not a good sign. 4.

Answer the following question: If I tell you that Aneurysms are caused by relaxation of cell walls of blood vessels, and ask you the question \\"what relaxes, thereby causing aneurysms?\\", is the correct answer \\"layers of fat\\"? Answer:","completion":"No, the correct answer is not \\"layers of fat.\\" Aneurysms are caused by the weakening of the blood vessel walls, which can lead to a localized dilation or ballooning of the blood vessel. The primary underlying factor that causes this weakening is associated with damage, degeneration, or inflammation of the blood vessel wall's structural components, including the muscular and elastic layers (tunica media and tunica intima). Several factors can contribute to the development of aneurysms, such as: 1. Genetic factors: Certain inherited conditions can cause a weakening of the connective tissue in blood vessel walls, such as Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, or familial aneurysm disorders. 2. Atherosclerosis: The buildup of fatty deposits (plaques) inside the arteries can cause their walls to become stiff, thick, and weak, increasing the risk of aneurysm formation. 3. High blood pressure: Chronic, uncontrolled high blood pressure can exert excessive force on the arterial walls, causing them to weaken over time. 4. Infection: In rare cases, a blood-borne infection can cause an inflammation of the blood vessel wall (vasculitis), which may result in an aneurysm. 5. Trauma: Physical injury to the blood vessel wall, either due to an accident or a medical procedure, can also lead to aneurysm formation. Although \\"layers of fat\\" can contribute indirectly to aneurysms by causing atherosclerosis, they are not the direct cause of relaxation or weakening of the blood vessel walls."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Uncle Jesse is the organizer of the reunion and at the same time, is facing a lawsuit filed by Mama Josephine Maxx for access across Duke property to the Hazzard swamp where she intends to build a theme park. Jesse however, refused access, not wanting to see the swamp destroyed. This however, has made the rest of the townsfolk angry with him, as the new theme park means new jobs, and revenue for Hazzard County.Driving from Washington, D.C., the Congressman representing Hazzard County in Washington, Cooter Davenport, arrives first and goes back to the Duke farm with Jesse, where Jesse is barbecuing ribs for everyone. Shortly thereafter, a car pulls up. Jesse recognizes it as Bo due to the sound of the motor. Bo has gotten a ride from a friend as he, having returned to the professional racing circuit and has come back for the reunion, has wrecked his car (again, according to Jesse).

They are a fictional race of Orcs, which are humanoid creatures crafted by the Dark Lord Sauron in J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth legendarium. The Uruk-hai play a significant role in the events of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" and are featured in both the books and the film adaptations directed by Peter Jackson. Uruk-hai are larger, stronger, and more intelligent than other types of Orcs, such as goblins and common orcs. Unlike these other orcs who are primarily nocturnal, Uruk-hai possess the ability to endure daylight without any negative consequences. They are more disciplined in battle and can carry out complex tasks, making them highly effective soldiers and warriors for Sauron and his ally, the corrupted wizard Saruman. The origin of the Uruk-hai started when Saruman, in his pursuit to acquire the One Ring and take over Middle-earth, joined forces with Sauron. Saruman began to experiment with Orcs, interbreeding them with Men and performing dark sorcery on them in order to create a new, more powerful breed of Orcs. Thus, the Uruk-hai were born. The term \\"Uruk-hai\\" is derived from the fictional Black Speech language created by Tolkien, with \\"Uruk\\" meaning \\"Orc\\" and \\"hai\\" translating as \\"folk\\" or \\"people.\\" Some prominent Uruk-hai characters in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" include: 1. Lurtz: A powerful and skilled Uruk-hai warrior, Lurtz is the commander of the scouting party that captures Merry and Pippin. He is responsible for the death of Boromir in the first book and film, \\"The Fellowship of the Ring.\\" Lurtz is a film-only character and does not appear in the books. 2. Uglúk: Uglúk is the leader of Saruman's Uruk-hai pack, tasked with tracking down the Fellowship and capturing the hobbits. He is a character from both the book and the film adaptations. Uglúk meets his demise at the hands of Éomer and the Riders of Rohan in \\"The Two Towers.\\" 3. Shagrat: Shagrat is a prominent Uruk-hai warrior in the books and films, serving as the captain of the Orc garrison at the Tower of Cirith Ungol. He is involved in capturing and guarding Frodo Baggins after the hobbit is paralyzed by the giant spider, Shelob. The Uruk-hai are visually distinct from other types of Orcs as well. They are taller and more muscular, often standing between 6 to 7 feet in height. Their skin color ranges from gray to blackish-green, and they usually have a more human-like appearance compared to the grotesque features of regular Orcs. In the films, they also have a distinct armor and weapon style, utilizing plate armor and wielding scimitars and large crossbows. In summary, the Uruk-hai are a specialized and enhanced breed of Orcs created by Saruman to serve as powerful soldiers for both his and Sauron's armies. They are larger, stronger, and more intelligent than other types of Orcs, and they play a significant role in the events of \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\""},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Chat Moss could also derive from Ceatta, an Old English personal name and mos, a swamp or alternatively the first element could be the Old English ceat meaning a piece of wet ground. It was recorded as Catemosse in 1277 and Chatmos in 1322. Moss is the local name for a peat bog.Daniel Defoe visited the area in 1724, on his way from Warrington to Manchester: From hence (Warrington), on the road to Manchester, we pass'd the great bog or waste call'd Chatmos, the first of that kind that we see in England ...

Four overlapping ecological regions have been identified on the Table Rocks, with considerable differences in the variety of wildlife found in each. From the outermost base of the rocks, three regions consisting of oak savanna, chaparral, and mixed woodland surround the relatively flat tops. The andesite cap is covered by the fourth region, mounded prairie. This region formed when the caps were slowly eroded by the freezing and thawing of water that seeped into the ground (ice erosion), which created layers of mounded soil. Vernal pools fill in from October to June in the mounded prairie area due to the andesite's impermeability. The pools support species of plants and animals. Over 340 species of plants grow on the rocks, including approximately 200 species of wildflowers. Some of the most common wildflowers are western buttercups, desert parsley, bicolor lupine, and California goldfields. Camas and death camas also grow on the rocks. Camas produces an edible bulb, while death camas is poisonous and was used by the Takelma as an anesthetic.More than 70 species of animals are known to live on the Table Rocks. Lizards such as the western fence lizard, southern alligator lizard, and western skink have been seen in all four regions of the Table Rocks. Western rattlesnakes and two species of garter snakes also live in all regions. Black-tailed deer, coyotes, and bobcats are some of the mammals that live on the Table Rocks. The rocks are also home to western black-legged ticks, although they are mainly found in the chaparral region. Many species of birds live on the rocks.The Table Rocks experience a Mediterranean climate.

In den letzten Jahren hat das Regime immer wieder Kritiker und Oppositionelle ins Visier genommen, um jegliche politische Widerstandsbewegung im Keim zu ersticken. Diese Praktiken sind Ausdruck eines repressiven politischen Systems, das seit Jahrzehnten von Präsident Obiang und seinen Vertrauten kontrolliert wird. Die Verhaftungen wurden häufig ohne Angabe von Gründen und ohne richterlichen Beschluss durchgeführt. In vielen Fällen wurden die Betroffenen inhaftiert, ohne dass ihnen die Möglichkeit gegeben wurde, sich mit ihren Familien in Verbindung zu setzen oder einen Anwalt ihrer Wahl einzuschalten. Oftmals wurden sie nach der Festnahme über einen längeren Zeitraum festgehalten und erst dann freigelassen, wenn sie Verpflichtungen gegenüber dem Staat eingegangen sind oder eine hohe Kaution gezahlt haben. Die Anklagepunkte gegen die regimekritischen Personen lassen oftmals jegliche Beweise oder stichhaltige Argumente vermissen.

The United Earth Government has created a system that separates the people into different realities based on their skills, backgrounds, and genetic traits. These realities are virtual environments that not only act as alternate societies, but also as experimental grounds for the government's secret research. Life in each reality is centered around specific fields such as technology, military, entertainment, and more. Captain John Anderton, a decorated officer in the United Earth Military in the military-based reality, discovers a confidential directive from the government's elite central council. This directive reveals a concealed plan to consolidate power by embedding control chips in the population, causing everyone to comply with the government's demands unquestioningly. Horrified at his discovery, John knows he has to fight against this sinister agenda and save humanity from falling into an irreversible dystopia. To accomplish this task, he starts seeking knowledge from experts across different realities. He believes that the answers to stopping the government's nefarious scheme lies in the expertise of Dr. Iris Hineman, a gifted scientist renowned for her work in the field of genetics and virtual reality engineering. As entering other realities is strictly forbidden, John illegally crosses the barriers that separate the realities and ventures into the science-based reality where Dr. Hineman resides. With the help of his insider connections, he tracks her down, only to find that she has been banished to a hidden sanctuary for conducting unsanctioned research. Upon meeting her, John reveals the government's plans, and Dr. Hineman reluctantly agrees to help him stop the conspiracy. As they delve deeper into the sinister mechanisms of the government, they realize that the original creators of the realities, a group of renegade scientists, had designed a fail-safe system to dismantle the segmented world and merge all the realities as a safeguard against complete government control. To unlock this fail-safe mechanism, John and Dr. Hineman must find and gather key components scattered across the different realities. Along the way, they recruit like-minded individuals and form a rebellion. Together, they infiltrate the most heavily guarded locations, revealing harsh truths and uncovering revolutionary technologies that could sway the balance of power. As John's team grows in strength, the government launches a manhunt to capture him and his cohorts, branding them as terrorists.

In a climactic confrontation, John and his team face off against the central council, ultimately using the fail-safe system to unite humanity across all realities. The government's plot is foiled, the control chips malfunction, and a new era dawns where the citizens of Earth, armed with the knowledge and experiences of their individual realities, work together to rebuild the world and create a unified, harmonious society.

But this year's surprise on the birthday of the great British playwright William Shakespeare is surely one of the most dramatic. On April 22, one day before his 441st birthday anniversary, experts discovered that one of the most recognizable portraits of William Shakespeare is a fake. This means that we no longer have a good idea of what Shakespeare looked like. \\"It's very possible that many pictures of Shakespeare might be unreliable because many of them are copies of this one,\\" said an expert from Britain's National Portrait Gallery. The discovery comes after four months of testing using X-rays, ultraviolet light, microphotography and paint samples. The experts from the gallery say the image --commonly known as the \\"Flower portrait\\"-- was actually painted in the 1800s, about two centuries after Shakespeare's death. The art experts who work at the gallery say they also used modern chemistry technology to check the paint on the picture. These checks found traces of paint dating from about 1814. Shakespeare died in 1616, and the date that appears on the portrait is 1609. \\"We now think the portrait dates back to around 1818 to 1840. This was when there was a renewed interest in Shakespeare's plays,\\" Tarnya Cooper, the gallery's curator , told the Associated President. The fake picture has often been used as a cover for collections of his plays. It is called the Flower portrait because one of its owners, Desmond Flower, gave it to the Royal Shakespeare Company. \\"There have always been questions about the painting,\\" said David Howells, curator for the Royal Shakespeare Company. \\"Now we know the truth, we can put the image in its proper place in the history of Shakespearean portraiture.\\" Two other images of Shakespeare, are also being studied as part of the investigation and the results will come out later this month. _ Question: What makes the birthday of Shakespeare dramatic this year? Yes or no, is the answer \\"The Flower portrait has been found to be a fake.\\"?

Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: to protect the eyes from sand in windy weather on a sand dune","completion":"To provide a well-informed recommendation for protecting the eyes from sand in windy weather on a sand dune, I will first consider two potential solutions: 1. Wearing goggles 2. Wearing sunglasses Now, I will analyze each solution based on their effectiveness in addressing the key concerns: protecting the eyes from sand and providing a comfortable experience in windy weather. 1. Wearing goggles: - Goggles provide a more secure fit on the face, which helps to keep out sand particles in windy conditions. - They create an airtight seal around the eyes, which adds an extra layer of protection from sand and wind. - Goggles are usually designed to provide clear visibility during extreme conditions, ensuring you can see properly in windy and sandy environments. - However, some people may find goggles uncomfortable or feel excessive if used for casual sand dune excursions. 2. Wearing sunglasses: - Sunglasses are light and easy to wear, providing a more comfortable experience for some people. - They offer protection from sunlight and glare, which can also be a concern in sandy environments. - Sunglasses with close-fitting or wraparound frames can offer a moderate level of protection from sand and wind. - However, they may not provide the same level of protection as goggles since they don't offer a complete seal around the eyes, allowing sand particles a greater chance to enter the eyes. After evaluating both options, I would recommend wearing goggles as the better solution for protecting the eyes from sand in windy weather on a sand dune. This is because goggles offer a more secure fit, create an airtight seal around the eyes, and are designed specifically for extreme conditions, providing superior protection from sand and wind. While sunglasses provide some benefits, they do not provide the same level of protection against sand particles entering the eyes during windy conditions."},{"prompt":"Q:Two continents were known for the strange discrepancies in animal populations. Asia was mostly populated by reptiles of all species, while Africa was mostly populated by birds and very few reptiles. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which continent was inhabited by fewer turtles? Hint: Reptiles are a class of animals comprising turtles, tuataras, lizards, snakes and crocodiles. They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw...

Immediately prior to the Holocaust, the number of Jews in the world stood at approximately 16.7 million. Statistical figures vary for the contemporary demography of Ashkenazi Jews, oscillating between 10 million and 11.2 million. Sergio DellaPergola in a rough calculation of Sephardic and Mizrahi Jews, implies that Ashkenazi make up less than 74% of Jews worldwide. Other estimates place Ashkenazi Jews as making up about 75% of Jews worldwide.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"Among the three options mentioned - Sephardic, Ashkenazi, and Holocaust - Holocaust is not a group of Jews. The term \\"Holocaust\\" refers to the genocide of approximately six million European Jews during World War II by the Nazi regime led by Adolf Hitler. This tragic event led to the deaths of Jews across Europe and left a lasting impact on Jewish communities worldwide. On the other hand, Sephardic and Ashkenazi Jews represent two major ethnolinguistic groups within the Jewish community. Sephardic Jews are those who originally resided in the Iberian Peninsula (covering modern-day Spain and Portugal). They were expelled from the region in the late 15th century during the Spanish Inquisition. As a result, Sephardic Jews migrated to different regions, including North Africa, the Ottoman Empire (mainly in modern-day Turkey, Greece, and the Balkans), and later to Western Europe and the Americas. Sephardic Jews have their unique culture, language (Ladino), and religious customs. Ashkenazi Jews, on the other hand, are descendants of Jewish communities that initially inhabited the Rhineland region in Western Germany and Northern France and later migrated to Eastern Europe. They constituted a significant proportion of the Jewish population in Eastern and Central European countries such as Poland, Ukraine, Lithuania, and Russia, among others, before the Holocaust. Ashkenazi Jews have their distinct culture, Yiddish language, and traditional customs. These two groups, Sephardic and Ashkenazi Jews, differ in their historical backgrounds, languages, and customs, although they share the same core beliefs within Judaism. Studies suggest that Ashkenazi Jews are a significant part of the global Jewish population, accounting for nearly 74-75% of Jews worldwide, as per the data provided in your context statement. In contrast, Sephardic Jews represent a smaller portion of the Jewish community. However, regardless of their size, both Sephardic and Ashkenazi Jews continue to contribute to the rich cultural and religious diversity of the Jewish people globally."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Mr Trump fumed about the deal the Obama administration struck with Canberra to take hundreds of refugees from Nauru and Manus Island, according to unnamed sources quoted by The Washington Post. In May, the prime minister was kept waiting ahead of the pair's face-to-face meeting in New York. Mr Trump delayed the meeting by three hours, instead remaining in Washington while a bill to replace Obamacare passed the House of Representatives. He later flew to New York, but only after holding a massive Republican press conference at the White House. It is understood Mr Trump called Mr Turnbull earlier in the day to explain he would be late, and said he looked forward to meeting him that night. The release of the audio has sparked intense debate online, with some arguing the prime minister's speech could damage Australian-US relations.

Q:Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Money, jewels and important documents are not the only valuable placed in banks these days. Some mothers store their breast milk in banks. There're ten breast banks set up across the United States, where mothers can donate their extra milk for other women's babies. Experts say breast milk is the best food for babies. The World Health Organization says it is the only food babies should get during the first six months of life, in most cases. Breast milk is especially important for babies born too early. Sometimes these premature babies must stay in the hospital for many weeks. James Cameron is a doctor who treats newborns at Lutheran Children's Hospital in Fort Wayne, Indiana. He says breast milk is almost like medicine. Doctor James Cameron said, \\"The fact is that there are so many different proteins and specialized sugars in the breast milk that the mom's able to make that help provide immunity. It's very important for the health of the newborn.\\" There are several reasons some mothers may not be able to breastfeed. Some are not able to produce enough milk. Others might be taking medicines or have medical problems that prevent the process. Lucy Baur lives near Fort Wayne. She fed her milk to both her children and always had more milk than they needed. She wanted to donate to the Indiana Mothers Milk Bank in Indianapolis. But freezing and shipping milk can be costly. Then, a donor station opened near her home. Milk donations in the United States work like this: Donors must be willing to provide almost three liters of breast milk. They freeze the milk and take it to the station. There, employees warm the milk and mix it with other mothers' milk. Then, the milk is heated to kill bacteria. After that, the technicians test samples of all the milk to make sure it is safe and healthful. The milk is re-frozen and sent to the main milk bank. The milk bank transports the milk to hospitals to feed premature or sick babies. Donors are tested for diseases before any milk is accepted. _ are not permitted to smoke tobacco,...

Think like you are answering to a five year old. U.S. Silence On Syria Is Deafening The script for weekends in Syria has become tragically predictable. So has the extent of global apathy. In fact, the motto for last Friday’s protests was “Your Silence is Killing Us.” Organizers used the motto to encourage more Syrians to join the growing masses, tens of thousands who come out every week to publicly call for President Bashar al-Assad to step down. And the violence in Syria just continues to grow. Monday, as Fox News.com reported: “Syrian troops kept up attacks on the restive city of Hama … a day after a brutal crackdown on anti-government protesters killed at least 70 and drew harsh rebukes from the U.S. and Europe. Sunday was one of the bloodiest days since the uprising against Assad's authoritarian rule began in mid-March. Six Syrian rights groups said in a joint statement that 74 people were killed throughout the country, 55 of them from Hama and neighboring villages.\\" What conclusions can we draw from this tragic news? Clearly, this regime now knows the United States will do virtually nothing to stop its attacks on its own people. The near global silence on Syria, of course, contrasts markedly with how the Arab League, U.N. Security Council, as well as NATO, came together on Libya out of urgent concern for Libyans threatened with certain death by Qaddafi’s forces. While the Libya saga is far from resolved, most of the world has given Assad a free pass, though he has proven no less determined than Qaddafi to use brutal violence to clampdown on any opposition. Once again it falls to Washington to project leadership. The White House must be more assertive. It must start with calling unequivocally for an end to the Assad family’s tyranny. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s recent statements that Assad “is not indispensable” or that his regime “has lost its legitimacy” are too mild. The Assad regime lost its legitimacy months ago, starting with the detention of youngsters in Daraa in March, a grotesque incident of repression that ignited the weekly protests against the Assad regime. Clinton should recall U.S. Ambassador Robert Ford to Washington now. His appointment by President Obama in January was premature. And, it was done hastily -- a presidential recess appointment to avoid congressional opposition to filling the post left vacant since the 2005 assassination of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri. The recent assault on the U.S. Embassy in Syria, organized by the Assad regime, followed by Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem’s threat to the American ambassador to not visit any cities outside Damascus, after he journeyed to besieged Hama several weeks ago, are provocations that should evoke stronger responses from Washington. Now that Assad has added the U.S. to his regime’s targets, President Obama should state in the clearest possible way that it’s time for Assad to leave, and then assertively press other U.N. Security Council members to follow suit. When the council meets in emergency session later today, behind closed doors, the U.S. must directly tell Russia and China, as well as Brazil, India, Lebanon and South Africa -- the council members that so far have blocked any actions that this international collective silence is enabling the Assad regime killers. Tragically, nearly 100 more citizens were needlessly gunned down over the weekend across Syria. The predictable weekly cycle in Syria continues. But global silence need not. The courageous Syrian protestors must hear that their efforts are not in vain, that there is concern for human rights and political reform in Syria, and that the Syrian people are not forgotten.

Gibson challenged the idea that the nervous system actively constructs conscious visual perception, and instead promoted ecological psychology, in which the mind directly perceives environmental stimuli without additional cognitive construction or processing. A \\"Review of General Psychology\\" survey, published in 2002, ranked Gibson as the 88th most cited psychologist of the 20th century, tied with John Garcia, David Rumelhart, Louis Leon Thurstone, Margaret Floy Washburn, and Robert S. Woodworth. - David Everett Rumelhart (June 12, 1942 March 13, 2011) was an American psychologist who made many contributions to the formal analysis of human cognition, working primarily within the frameworks of mathematical psychology, symbolic artificial intelligence, and parallel distributed processing. He also admired formal linguistic approaches to cognition, and explored the possibility of formulating a formal grammar to capture the structure of stories. - Eleanor Jack Gibson ( December 7 , 1910 -- December 30 , 2002 ) was an American psychologist . Among her contributions to psychology , the most important are the study of perception in infants and toddlers . She is popularly known for the \`\` visual cliff '' experiment in which precocial animals , and crawling human infants , showed their ability to perceive depth by avoiding the deep side of a virtual cliff . Along with her husband James J. Gibson , she forwarded the concept that perceptual learning takes place by differentiation . Gibson is credited with creating the Gibsonian or ecological theory of development , which centers on the concept of affordances and how children learn to perceive them . According to Life magazine in 1959 , the \`\` Visual Cliff '' was \`\` a wooden table from the edge of which strong plate glass extended ... Children were put on the table top and coaxed to crawl out over the glass . But when they got to the edge of the cliff and looked down almost all of them quickly withdrew . Even their mothers ' most persuasive urgings could not get them out . '' Similar studies were done with animals , including rats and kittens . The visual cliff findings indicated that perception is an essentially adaptive process , or as Dr. Gibson put it , We perceive to learn , as well as learn to perceive . In 1982 , she was invited to Beijing to teach Chinese psychologists about recent theories and techniques of research . She was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1977 . In 1992 , Eleanor Gibson was awarded the National Medal of Science . A Review of General Psychology survey , published in 2002 , ranked Gibson as the 74th most cited psychologist of the 20th century , in a tie with Paul E. Meehl . - James Bowdoin II (August 7, 1726 November 6, 1790) was an American political and intellectual leader from Boston, Massachusetts, during the American Revolution and the following decade. He initially gained fame and influence as a wealthy merchant. He served in both branches of the Massachusetts General Court from the 1750s to the 1770s. Although he was initially supportive of the royal governors, he opposed British colonial policy and eventually became an influential advocate of independence. He authored a highly political report on the 1770 Boston Massacre that has been described by historian Francis Walett as one of the most influential pieces of writing that shaped public opinion in the colonies. - The visual cliff apparatus was created by psychologists Eleanor J. Gibson and Richard D. Walk at Cornell University to investigate depth perception in human and animal species. This apparatus allowed them to experimentally adjust the optical and tactical stimuli associated with a simulated cliff while protecting the subjects from injury. The visual cliff consists of a sheet of Plexiglas that covers a cloth with a high-contrast checkerboard pattern. On one side the cloth is placed immediately beneath the Plexiglas, and on the other, it is dropped about 4 feet below. Since the Plexiglas supports the weight of the infant this is a visual cliff rather than a drop off. Using a visual cliff apparatus, Gibson and Walk examined possible perceptual differences at crawling age between human infants born preterm and human infants born at term without documented visual or motor impairments. - The American Academy of Arts and Sciences, frequently known as the American Academy, is one of the oldest and most prestigious honorary societies and a leading center for policy research in the United States. Election to the Academy is considered one of the nation's highest honors since its founding during the American Revolution by John Adams, John Hancock, James Bowdoin, and other scholar-patriots who contributed prominently to the establishment of the new nation, its government, and the United States Constitution. - Eleanor Jack Gibson (7 December 1910 30 December 2002) was an American psychologist who focused on reading development and perceptual learning in infants and toddlers. In the 1960s and 1970s Gibson, with her husband James J. Gibson, created the Gibsonian ecological theory of development which emphasized how important perception was because it allows humans to adapt to their environments. Perhaps her most well-known contribution to psychology was the \\"visual cliff\\", which studied depth perception and visual or motor impairments in both human and animal species. This led to a new understanding of perceptual development in infants. The environment provides information for the sensory system to develop with increased stimuli, so perceptual development corresponds with environmental stimuli. Infants develop from adapting to the environment. Gibson was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1971 and as a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1977. In 1992 she was awarded the National Medal of Science, which is the highest scientific honor in the United States, and only five of which have been awarded to psychologists. - Margaret Floy Washburn (July 25, 1871 October 29, 1939), leading American psychologist in the early 20th century, was best known for her experimental work in animal behavior and motor theory development. She was the first woman to be granted a PhD in psychology (1894), and the second woman, after Mary Whiton Calkins, to serve as an APA President (1921). A \\"Review of General Psychology\\" survey, published in 2002, ranked Washburn as the 88th most cited psychologist of the 20th century, tied with John Garcia, James J. Gibson, David Rumelhart, Louis Leon Thurstone, and Robert S. Woodworth. - Robert Sessions Woodworth (October 17, 1869 July 4, 1962) was an American academic psychologist of the first half of the twentieth century. He studied under William James along with such prominent psychologists as Leta Stetter Hollingworth, James Rowland Angell, and Edward Thorndike. A graduate of Harvard and Columbia, his textbook \\"Psychology: A study of mental life\\", which appeared first in 1921, went through many editions and was the first introduction to psychology for generations of undergraduate students. His 1938 textbook of Experimental Psychology was scarcely less influential, especially in the 1954 second edition, written with Harold H. Schlosberg. He is known for introducing the Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R) formula of behavior. A \\"Review of General Psychology\\" survey, published in 2002, ranked Woodworth as the 88th most cited psychologist of the 20th century, tied with John Garcia, James J. Gibson, David Rumelhart, Louis Leon Thurstone, and Margaret Floy Washburn. - Perceptual learning is the process of learning improved skills of perception. These improvements range from simple sensory discriminations (e.g., distinguishing two musical tones from one another) to complex categorizations of spatial and temporal patterns relevant to real-world expertise (e.g., reading, seeing relations among chess pieces, knowing whether or not an X-ray image shows a tumor). Sensory modalities may include visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory, and taste. Perceptual learning forms important foundations of complex cognitive processes (i.e., language) and interacts with other kinds of learning to produce perceptual expertise. Underlying perceptual learning are changes in the neural circuitry. The ability for perceptual learning is retained throughout life. - The National Medal of Science is an honor bestowed by the President of the United States to individuals in science and engineering who have made important contributions to the advancement of knowledge in the fields of behavioral and social sciences, biology, chemistry, engineering, mathematics and physics. The twelve member presidential Committee on the National Medal of Science is responsible for selecting award recipients and is administered by the National Science Foundation (NSF). - Louis Leon Thurstone (29 May 1887 30 September 1955) was a U.S. pioneer in the fields of psychometrics and psychophysics. He conceived the approach to measurement known as the law of comparative judgment, and is well known for his contributions to factor analysis.

Gareth Southgate's Young Lions take on Croatia in the first leg of their play-off at Molineux on Friday night and head into the match in fine form having won nine of their 10 group games. But former England and Manchester United midfielder Scholes writes in his Independent column that there needs to be a culture change if England are to succeed at Under 21 level. Jack Wilshere - man of the match against San Marino - will be eligible to play for the Under 21s next summer. Liverpool attacker Raheem Sterling should also go the European Under 21 Championship, says Paul Scholes. 'There are too many young players who, having made a senior debut, see a move to the Under 21s as a demotion,' Scholes argues. 'Calum Chambers is a prime example. He went from the Under 19s to the senior team. Then he was in the Under 21s squad this week until the injury to John Stones meant that he returned to the seniors. 'I have no reason to doubt that Chambers would have taken the Under 21s seriously. But if any player needs a reminder, they only have to look as far as Juan Mata.

Should Southgate’s team make it to the tournament, I would advocate taking Raheem Sterling and Jack Wilshere to the tournament next summer, even though they are well-established in the senior team.' Scholes highlights the counter-argument to his point; namely that dropping players who had played in qualifiers for those who haven't would be inherently unfair. But he retorts: 'Does the Football Association want to win something? If the answer is 'Yes', then it is time to be ruthless about getting the best team on the pitch.'

An injury to his knee ruled Mamen out from this mission, which was undertaken by ship's steward Ernest Chafe, with the Inuit pair, Kataktovik and Kuraluk. Chafe's group came within 2 miles (3 km) of Herald Island before being stopped by open water. A careful examination through binoculars revealed no signs of the missing party, and Chafe concluded that Anderson and company had not reached the island.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Aeropostale hires ex-CEO to right the ship Aeropostale ARO has tapped its former CEO for the top job again, hoping lightning can strike twice. The teen apparel retailer, which has taken a beating as its young customers have moved on to fast fashion chains like H&M and Uniqlo or simply shifted their spending to electronics, said on Monday that Julian Geiger, who resigned as CEO in 2010, has taken the reins again, effective immediately. His return marks the end of a failed tenure of Tom Johnson, on whose watch Aeropostale’s sales and profits have evaporated. Aeropostale’s annual sales peaked at 2.4 billion in 2010 and by 2013 they had fallen to 2.09 billion. The losing streak continued this year: comparable sales, which strip out the numbers from newly opened or newly closed stores, fell 13%, a deeper decline than the 10.5% drop Wall Street analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were expecting. (The company will report full quarterly results on Thursday.) Geiger, who was CEO of the now bankrupt and crumbling Crumbs Bake Shop cupcake chain until December, was Aeropostale’s CEO from 1996 to 2010 and oversaw a period of astronomical growth for a brand that started life in the early 1980’s as a young men’s fashion brand created by Macy’s M : The stock rose more than 800% during his reign and revenue almost doubled between 2006 and 2010, when Aeropostale was at peak popularity. That is kind of growth Aeropostale’s board pointed to in explaining their choice of Geiger, whose return was telegraphed when he rejoined the board earlier this year. “Julian was the leader of Aeropostale’s strategic direction during a period of significant growth, and we are confident in his enthusiasm for the business, his understanding of today’s teen retail marketplace and his intuition regarding teen fashion,” Aeropostale Chairperson Karin Hirtler-Garvey said in a statement. But the tide has turned dramatically in the teen apparel sector. And for Aeropostale, the decline was especially brutal compared to that at American Eagle Outfitters AEO and Abercrombie & Fitch ANF because it caters to a lower income customer than its two arch-rivals. In May, private equity firm Sycamore Partners gave Aeropostale a 150 million line of credit a week after the retailer reported an 83% drop in cash holdings versus a year earlier, easing fears of a near-term cash crunch. Geiger’s return is the latest case of an ex-CEO returning to the fold to fix a troubled company: in 2013, J.C. Penney JCP and Procter & Gamble PG brought back Mike Ullman and A.G. Lafley, respectively. Still, investors seemed pleased by Aeropostale’s move — shares rose 6.5 percent to 3.45 in after-hours trading.","completion":"Aeropostale, a clothing store for teenagers, has hired its former CEO, Julian Geiger, to be the boss again. The company has not been doing very well lately because young customers are shopping at other stores like H&M and Uniqlo or spending their money on electronics.

As part of this year's examination, both men had their arterial walls examined to identify the presence of plaques. The doctor discovered that Jake had a high amount of plaques present on the interior of his arterial wall. Ryan, on the other hand, had no plaques present. Who will have more restricted blood flow through their arteries? A:","completion":"Jake, who had a high amount of plaques present on the interior of his arterial wall, will have more restricted blood flow through his arteries compared to Ryan, who had no plaques present. Plaques are deposits of substances such as fats, cholesterol, calcium, and cellular waste products that accumulate on the interior walls of arteries. When these substances build up, they form a thick, hard layer known as an atherosclerotic plaque. This process is called atherosclerosis. Over time, these plaques can begin to narrow the arterial lumen, reducing the diameter through which blood can flow. This can ultimately lead to an obstruction or decreased flexibility of the arterial walls, making it more difficult for blood to circulate throughout the body. In Jake's case, the presence of a high amount of plaque indicates that some of his arteries may have already begun to narrow, reducing blood flow. As blood flow becomes more restricted, it can result in an increased risk of various cardiovascular conditions, including coronary artery disease, heart attacks, and strokes. The increased resistance may lead to higher blood pressure, as the heart has to work harder to pump blood through the narrowed arteries. By contrast, Ryan's lack of plaque buildup means that the interior of his arteries is relatively clean and smooth, allowing blood to flow through with minimal resistance. This results in a lower risk of cardiovascular issues and often correlates with lower blood pressure. The difference in plaque buildup between Jake and Ryan may be due to various factors, including genetics, lifestyle habits such as diet and exercise, and other health conditions that predispose someone to plaque accumulation. It is important for both Jake and Ryan to maintain a healthy lifestyle, aiming to prevent further plaque build-up in their arteries. For Jake, in particular, the doctor might suggest a combination of lifestyle changes and medical intervention to manage his current plaque build-up, reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, and promote the efficient circulation of blood throughout his body. Such interventions may include changes in diet, increased physical activity, quitting smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, and medications like statins or blood pressure-lowering drugs, depending on the specific circumstances and recommendations of a healthcare professional."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But the additional cash is expected to be spent on projects to support overseas development aid. Initial reaction from the scientific community suggested that this was \\"good\\" settlement - but not a \\"great one\\". In announcing the settlement in his Spending Review on Wednesday, George Osborne said: \\"In the modern world, one of the best ways you can back business is by backing science. \\"That's why, in the last Parliament, I protected the resource budget for science in cash terms. In this Parliament I'm protecting it in real terms so it rises to £4.7bn.\\" One senior researcher, who did not wish to be named, told BBC News that the details they had seen suggested there might be a number of strings attached. \\"What has actually been announced is another four years of flat cash for the core activities of the research community,\\" they said. The previous flat cash settlement has seen an erosion of spending power for research, so the concern is that a similar situation would continue. The chancellor's extra £1.5bn is from a fund for supporting overseas development projects. That would mean that by 2020 up to 10% of the science budget will be ring-fenced - to be spent only on projects that would benefit development aid. Those responsible for allocating the money will hope that these additional funds can be used on projects that meet the development criteria. This would release funds for others that don't. The Nobel Laureate and president of the Royal Society, Sir Paul Nurse, said: \\"The chancellor rightly declared the UK to be brilliant at science and by protecting the science budget in real terms he is giving British scientists an improved chance of maintaining our global leadership, improving lives and driving the economy. \\"The last five years have seen cuts to the science budget of around £1bn, so protection from such cuts over the next five years is to be welcomed. \\"This settlement does, however, still leave us well behind our competitors in terms of the percentage of our GDP we spend on research. There is also still detail to be looked at and we will be doing that over the coming hours and days.\\" Many had hoped for an increase in the science budget to stay competitive with other nations that are heavily investing in science. Among them was Prof Paul Hardaker, chief executive of the Institute of Physics. \\"This will help UK science but we still need to be mindful of how this compares to higher investment by international competitors,\\" he said. Similar concerns were expressed by Dr Jenny Rohn, chair of Science is Vital. \\"As it stands, this science budget appears to be smaller than in 2010 thanks to preceding inflation, and will continue to shrink both as a fraction of GDP and per capita,\\" she explained. Many others though, such as Sir John Tooke, president of the Academy of Medical Sciences, were relieved that science had been spared the cuts suffered in other areas of government spending. \\"In a wider landscape of shrinking budgets, we're grateful that the chancellor has recognised the need to protect research for the long-term benefit of the UK,\\" he said. Naomi Weir, acting director of the Campaign for Science and Engineering (Case), said she was pleased to see that the chancellor was continuing to support a strategy for science and industry. \\"Committing to invest in science and innovation is investing for the future: creating high-value jobs, driving productivity, and catalysing economic growth,\\" she said. \\"It will have far reaching benefits in education, security and resilience, and health. There are undoubtedly some details to unpick, but it is encouraging on many counts to see that the government has listened to the science community and made an evidence-informed decision to back science and engineering in today's Spending Review.\\" The chancellor also announced funding for the Royce Institute in Manchester, and new agricultural research centres in Shropshire, York, Bedfordshire and Edinburgh. And Mr Osborne announced a £75m investment for the Cavendish Laboratories at Cambridge University. He added that in order to get the most from government investment in science, he would implement the recommendations of a review of science spending carried out by the Nobel Laureate Sir Paul Nurse.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person whose father is in school? The film is set in the early 1980s in small town Virginia. Aurelie is the new girl in town, having recently relocated from Washington D.C. with her parents Jim (a former steward for Air Force One) and Jeanne. Jim is attending college on a scholarship to become a physician while Jeanne, now the breadwinner, works at the local chicken shack. Aurelie asks her parents if she can have a permanent to fit in with the \\"Farrah Fawcett\\" types in town. Her parents finally relent and take her to a local beauty school to get her hair processed at a discount. The result is disastrous, making Aurelie look more like orphan Annie than Farrah. She starts school and is immediately teased by everyone. She tries to befriend the only black girl in school, Lydia, but is rebuffed. Aurelie furthers her unpopularity by overly participating in class and is frequently bullied by a group of popular girls. Aurelie reluctantly takes a karate class in order to defend herself. She sees a sign on another beauty shop in town that advertises permanent fixes for 60 and resolves to make the money. Eventually the school holds a poetry reading contest, with a top prize of 75. Aurelie signs up herself and Lydia. Lydia initially does not want to participate. During the poetry contest she panics and recites the lyrics to \\"Feeling Good\\" instead of her assigned poem. Meanwhile, Aurelie is confronted by the popular girls. She uses her karate training to defeat the girls and returns to the contest to see that Lydia has been announced the winner. Lydia offers Aurelie the money to fix her hair, and Aurelie declines saying that she no longer cares. Answer:","completion":"The first name of the person whose father is in school is Aurelie.

Movie title: Suspect Context: Set in Washington DC, Suspect centers on three disparate characters. Carl Wayne Anderson is a homeless, deaf-mute Vietnam veteran accused of murdering Elizabeth Quinn, a file clerk at the Justice Department. Kathleen Riley is the beleaguered Federal Public Defender assigned to represent Anderson. An agribusiness lobbyist who normally works on Capitol Hill, Eddie Sanger, is made a member of the jury and begins investigating the details of the murder himself, eventually teaming up with Riley to solve the case. We see some early scenes of Sanger's work as a lobbyist on Capitol Hill, including his efforts to win passage of a bill by seducing a Congresswoman. While not relevant to the movie's plot, these scenes are establishing shots giving us a sense for Sanger as a charming, though somewhat ruthless, person.The movie begins around Christmas with the suicide of a United States Supreme Court Justice, for which no explanation or context is given. We only see the Justice making a tape recording and then shooting himself. Shortly after the Justice's suicide, Elizabeth Quinn's body is found floating in the Potomac river, and Carl Wayne Anderson is arrested for the crime, based almost entirely on the fact that he was found sleeping in Quinn's car, which was abandoned in the parking lot where she worked (and was mostly deserted at night). Anderson explains that he found it unlocked and was just looking for a warm place to sleep since it was the dead of winter. But since he was homeless, had no alibi, and was found in Quinn's car, he was arrested for her murder. The establishing scenes show Riley trying to communicate with Anderson and realizing that he is a deaf-mute. Over time, she begins to penetrate his hard exterior and he tries to cooperate with her efforts to mount a defense for him.In the District of Columbia, all crimes are tried in the federal courts, so a murder trial that would normally be in state court was in federal court instead.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the individual known from their highly regarded work with the Pixies? Pod was released in the UK on May 29, 1990 by 4AD. Watts-Russell planned the date to be not too close to the release of the Pixies' Bossanova two and a half months later, for more effective publicity of both albums. Watts-Russell believed the album would be better suited to a US independent distribution label rather than the Pixies' American distributor Elektra, and licensed Pod to Rough Trade America. When this division of Rough Trade went bankrupt, Elektra assumed distribution of Pod in the US. Deal has noted that the Breeders did not receive any royalties from initial US sales because of Rough Trade's bankruptcy.The album was widely anticipated by the British music press due to the involvement of Deal and Donelly—known from their highly regarded work with the Pixies and Throwing Muses, respectively—and Albini, who likewise had a strong reputation for his previous engineering work. It reached number 22 in the UK, where it was promoted by a full-page ad in Melody Maker, and number 73 in the Netherlands. Pod sold moderately well, although Deal has noted it \\"never sold [anything]\\" compared to their next album, Last Splash (1993), which was certified platinum in the US and silver in the UK.Deal took the idea for the album's title from a painting that she saw in Boston; for her, the word \\"pod\\" evoked a uterus, which Wiggs has noted relates to the theme of fertility and the group's name. The cover art was designed by longtime 4AD album designer Vaughan Oliver and employs photography by Kevin Westenberg. Oliver, in an attempt to seduce Deal, whom he believed would appreciate the humor, attached a belt of dead eels over his underwear, which he intended as phallic symbols. He performed a fertility dance, while Westenberg took pictures of him using a long exposure to achieve the blurring and other visual effects.

Xi Jinping (; Chinese: Xi Jin Ping ; pinyin: Xi Jinping; born 15 June 1953) is a Chinese politician currently serving as General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, President of the People's Republic of China, and Chairman of the Central Military Commission. As Xi holds the top offices of the party, the state, and the military, he is sometimes referred to as China's \\"paramount leader\\"; in 2016, the party officially gave him the title of \\"core\\" leader. Xi was appointed to the nine-man Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China at the 17th Party Congress in October 2007. Xi was ranked above Li Keqiang, an indication that he was going to succeed Hu Jintao as China's next leader. In addition, Xi also held the top-ranking membership of the Communist Party's Central Secretariat. This assessment was further supported at the 11th National People's Congress in March 2008, when Xi was elected as Vice-President of the People's Republic of China. Following his elevation, Xi has held a broad range of portfolios. He was put in charge of the comprehensive preparations for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, as well as being the central government's leading figure in Hong Kong and Macau affairs. In addition, he also became the new President of the Central Party School of the Communist Party of China, the cadre-training and ideological education wing of the Communist Party. In the wake of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, Xi visited disaster areas in Shaanxi and Gansu. Xi made his first foreign trip as vice president to North Korea, Mongolia, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Yemen from 17 to 25 June 2008. After the Olympics, Xi was assigned the post of Committee Chair for the preparations of the 60th Anniversary Celebrations of the founding of the People's Republic of China. He was also reportedly at the helm of a top-level Communist Party committee dubbed the 6521 Project, which was charged with ensuring social stability during a series of politically sensitive anniversaries in 2009. Xi is considered to be one of the most successful members of the Crown Prince Party, a quasi-clique of politicians who are descendants of early Chinese Communist revolutionaries. Former Prime Minister of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, when asked about Xi, said he felt he was \\"a thoughtful man who has gone through many trials and tribulations.\\" Lee also commented: \\"I would put him in the Nelson Mandela class of persons. A person with enormous emotional stability who does not allow his personal misfortunes or sufferings affect his judgment. In other words, he is impressive\\". Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson described Xi as \\"the kind of guy who knows how to get things over the goal line.\\" Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said that Xi \\"has sufficient reformist, party and military background to be very much his own man.\\" Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton tweeted, \\"Xi hosting a meeting on women's rights at the UN while persecuting feminists?

Based on this information, the next sentence does not necessarily follow the given text.

According to the actress, her father (Mohammed Kaif) is a British businessman of Kashmiri Indian descent and her mother (Suzanne, also spelt Susanna) is an English lawyer and charity worker. She has seven siblings: three elder sisters (Stephanie, Christine, and Natasha), three younger sisters (Melissa, Sonia, and Isabel) and an elder brother, Michael. Isabelle Kaif is also a model and actress. Kaif's parents divorced when she was a child, and her father moved to the United States. She said her father had no influence on Kaif or her siblings while they were growing up, and they were raised by their mother. On her father's absence in her life, Kaif stated: \\"When I see friends who have wonderful fathers who are like pillars of support for their families, I say, if only I had that. But instead of complaining, I should be grateful for all the other things I have\\". In a 2009 interview with The Indian Express, she said she was not in touch with her father. Kaif says that her mother decided to \\"dedicate her life to social causes\\", which led to the family's relocation to a number of countries for varying lengths of time: Our transitions in growing up were--from Hong Kong where I was born, to China, then to Japan, and from Japan by boat to France ... After France, Switzerland--and I'm cutting out many East European countries where we were for only a few months each--then Poland in Krakow ... After that we went to Belgium, then to Hawaii, which was a short time, and then came to London. Due to their frequent relocation, Kaif and her siblings were home-schooled by a series of tutors. Although she is thought to have grown up in London, she lived there for only three years before moving to India. According to Kaif, she then changed her surname to her father's because she thought it would be easier to pronounce. Kaif's paternal parentage has been questioned by some members of the film industry. In a 2011 interview with Mumbai Mirror, Boom producer Ayesha Shroff accused Kaif of fabricating her history: \\"We created an identity for her.

Barbie stars as Genevieve, one of twelve princesses who live in a castle with their widowed father, King Randolph. The princesses have adventurous and free-spirited natures that are viewed as \\"unladylike\\" and \\"non-proper\\" by other members of the royal society. This leads King Randolph to summon his cousin, Duchess Rowena, to the castle to help raise the princesses. Unbeknownst to King Randolph, Rowena plans to poison him and get rid of his daughters so that she can become queen. Attempting to break the princesses' spirits, Rowena makes their lives miserable by stripping the castle of everything they love, making them wear grey dresses and banishing singing and dancing. The princesses find comfort in their late mother's favorite story, which tells of a magical kingdom where golden flowers grant wishes and princesses can dance at an enchanted pavilion for three nights. The princesses realize that the story contains clues on how to enter the magical kingdom from their own bedroom, by dancing on specific stones on the floor from oldest to youngest. Now inside the magical kingdom, the princesses discover that the water there possesses healing properties. The next day, the princesses appear tired and the duchess finds their new dancing shoes worn through, arousing her suspicion. The royal cobbler and Genevieve's love interest, Derek, comes to fix their shoes and sees that they are covered in gold dust. When King Randolph mysteriously falls ill, Genevieve is prompted to ask Derek to investigate Rowena's true intentions. That night, the princesses return to the magical kingdom to dance.

Upon entering, I noticed a lack of cleanliness in the dining area, with several dirty tables and floors that seemed like they hadn't been swept for days. The ambiance of the restaurant also left much to be desired. The lighting was harsh and bright, and the noise level was quite high, making it difficult to hold a conversation with my friends. Moreover, we were seated in a cramped space in the corner, making our dining experience uncomfortable. As for the food, it took almost an hour for our dishes to arrive, despite the restaurant not being particularly busy. When our meals finally arrived, we were extremely disappointed with the taste and quality. My pasta dish was cold and bland, while my friend's steak was overcooked and tough. The presentation of the dishes was unimpressive, and it seemed like little effort was put into the preparation. The service at the restaurant was equally disappointing. Our server was inattentive and seemed overwhelmed, even though there were only a few other tables being served. We had to flag him down multiple times to order, ask for drink refills, and request the check. In conclusion, I cannot recommend this restaurant due to the poor food quality, disappointing ambiance, lack of cleanliness, and subpar service. It is unfortunate that my experience was so negative, and I hope that the restaurant can address these issues to avoid further disappointments for future patrons.

Is electron shielding higher or lower in Mardine? A high school student, Timmy, is reading about elements of a periodic table. He is studying the periodic table when he decides to compare two random elements within the same column. He chooses Mardine and Sampline to compare and contrast and gets to work. The first thing he notices is that Sampline is further down the periodic table than Mardine. It's not much information to go on, but it's a good starting point for Timmy. Hint: The general trend in electronegativity is that the value increases from left to right across a row in the periodic table and decreases down a column. The most electronegative element is fluorine, which has a value of 4.0. As discussed in the lesson \\"Trends in the Periodic Table,\\" electronegativity increases across a row as the number of protons in the nucleus increases and therefore has a stronger pull. Electronegativity decreases down a column due to an increased effect of electron shielding in larger atoms. The answer is:","completion":"Electron shielding in Mardine would be lower compared to Sampline. To understand this, we need to delve into aspects of chemistry, particularly the phenomenon called electron shielding. Electron shielding describes the decrease in attraction between an electron and the nucleus in any atom with more than one electron shell. Essentially, electron shielding is caused by electrons in lower energy levels repelling electrons in higher energy layers, causing a decrease in effective nuclear charge. Now, when it pertains to the periodic table, as you move down a column (also known as a group), the number of energy levels increases. This increase in energy levels also leads to an increase in the number of electrons found in these outer shells. As the number of electrons in these outer shells increase, the degree of electron shielding increases as well. In the case of Mardine and Sampline, Sampline is further down the periodic table than Mardine. This information indicates that Sampline has more energy levels compared to Mardine and thus, more electron shielding. It's because with each step down a group in the periodic table, an additional electron shell is added. These additional shells effectively 'shield' the outermost electrons from the pull of the nucleus, decreasing electronegativity. So, considering these aspects, we can determine that electron shielding is higher in Sampline and lower in Mardine. Please note that \\"Mardine\\" and \\"Sampline\\" are not actual elements in the periodic table but are used for the sake of this specific scenario."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The sword was named after Osman I, founder of the Ottoman Dynasty. The practice started when Osman I was girt with the sword of Islam by his mentor and father-in-law Sheikh Edebali. The girding of the sword of Osman was a vital ceremony which took place within two weeks of a sultan's accession to the throne. It was held at the tomb complex at Eyüp, on the Golden Horn waterway in the capital Constantinople. Even though the journey from Topkap Palace (where the sultan resided) to the Golden Horn was short, the sultan would board a boat amid much pomp to go there. The Eyüp tomb complex was built by Mehmed II in honour of Abu Ayyub al-Ansari, a companion of Muhammad who had died during the first Muslim siege of Constantinople in the 7th century. The sword girding thus occurred on what was regarded as sacred grounds, and linked the newly enthroned sultan both to his 13th-century ancestors and to Muhammad himself. - The Ottoman Empire ('; Modern Turkish: ' or '), also known as the Turkish Empire, Ottoman Turkey, was an empire founded at the end of the thirteenth century in northwestern Anatolia in the vicinity of Bilecik and Söüt by the Oghuz Turkish tribal leader Osman. After 1354, the Ottomans crossed into Europe, and with the conquest of the Balkans the Ottoman Beylik was transformed into a transcontinental empire. The Ottomans ended the Byzantine Empire with the 1453 conquest of Constantinople by Mehmed the Conqueror. - Mehmed VI (\\"Memed-i sâdis\\", \\"Vahideddin\\", or ), who is also known as \\"ahbaba\\" (meaning \\"Emperor-father\\") among his relatives, (14 January 1861 16 May 1926) was the 36th and last Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, reigning from 1918 to 1922. The brother of Mehmed V, he succeeded to the throne as the eldest male member of the House of Osman after the 1916 suicide of Abdülaziz's son Yusuf Izzettin Efendi, the heir to the throne. He was girded with the Sword of Osman on 4 July 1918, as the thirty-sixth \\"padishah\\". His father was Sultan Abdülmecid I and mother was Gülüstü Hanm (1830 1865), an ethnic Abkhazian, daughter of Prince Tahir Bey Çaçba and his wife Afie Lakerba, originally named Fatma Çaçba. Mehmed was removed from the throne when the Ottoman sultanate was abolished in 1922. - Gülüstü Hanm; (1840 1865) was the Empress consort of Sultan Abdülmecid I. She was the mother of Mehmed VI, the last Sultan of the Ottoman Empire. - Abdülmecid I (Ottoman Turkish: \\"Abdül-Mecd-i evvel\\"; 23/25 April 182325 June 1861), also known as Abdulmejid and similar spellings, was the 31st Sultan of the Ottoman Empire and succeeded his father Mahmud II on 2 July 1839. His reign was notable for the rise of nationalist movements within the empire's territories. Abdülmecid wanted to encourage Ottomanism among the secessionist subject nations and stop the rise of nationalist movements within the empire, but failed to succeed despite trying to integrate non-Muslims and non-Turks more thoroughly into Ottoman society with new laws and reforms. He tried to forge alliances with the major powers of Western Europe, namely the United Kingdom and France, who fought alongside the Ottoman Empire in the Crimean War against Russia. In the following Congress of Paris on 30 March 1856, the Ottoman Empire was officially included among the European family of nations. Abdülmecid's biggest achievement was the announcement and application of the Tanzimat (Reorganization) reforms which were prepared by his father and effectively started the modernization of the Ottoman Empire in 1839. For this achievement, one of the Imperial anthems of the Ottoman Empire, the March of Abdülmecid, was named after him. - The Ottoman Empire used anthems since its foundation in the late 13th century, but did not use a specific imperial or national anthem until the 19th century. During the reign of Mahmud II, when the military and imperial band were re-organized along Western lines, Giuseppe Donizetti was invited to head the process. Donizetti Pasha, as he was known in the Ottoman Empire, composed the first Western-style imperial anthem, the \\"Mahmudiye Mar\\". - The March of Abdülmecid (Turkish: \\"Mecidiye Mar\\") was the national anthem of the Ottoman Empire. The title refers to Abdülmecid I (18391861). There were different anthems for each sultan. - Mehmed V Reshad ( Ottoman Turkish : Memed - i âmis , Turkish : Mehmed V Read or Reat Mehmet ) ( 2 November 1844 -- 3 July 1918 ) was the 35th Ottoman Sultan . He was the son of Sultan Abdülmecid I. He was succeeded by his half - brother Mehmed VI . - Padeshah, Padshah, Padishah or Badishah is a superlative royal title of Persian origin, composed of the Persian \\"pd\\" \\"master\\" and the widespread \\"shh\\" \\"king\\", which was adopted by several monarchs claiming the highest rank, roughly equivalent to the ancient Persian notion of \\"The Great\\" or \\"Great King\\", and later adopted by post-Achaemenid and Christian Emperors. Its Arabized pronunciation as Badshah was used by Mughal emperors. - Mahmud II (Ottoman Turkish: \\"Mahmud-u sn\\", \\"Mahmud-u Âdlî\\") (20 July 1785 1 July 1839) was the 30th Sultan of the Ottoman Empire from 1808 until his death in 1839. He was born in the Topkap Palace, Constantinople, the posthumous son of Sultan Abdul Hamid I. - Ottomanism (\\"Osmanllk\\" or \\"Osmanlclk\\") was a concept which developed prior to the First Constitutional Era of the Ottoman Empire. Its proponents believed that it could solve the social issues that the empire was facing. Ottomanism was strongly influenced by thinkers such as Montesquieu and Rousseau and the French Revolution. It promoted equality among the \\"millet\\"s. The idea originated amongst the Young Ottomans in areas such as the acceptance of all separate ethnicities in the Empire regardless of their religion, i.e. they were all 'Ottomans' with equal rights. Put simply, Ottomanism stated that all subjects were equal before the law. Ideally, all citizens would share a geographical area, a language, culture, and a sense of a 'non-Ottoman' party who were different than them. The essence of the \\"millet\\" system was not dismantled, but secular organizations and policies were applied. Primary education, conscription, head tax and military service were to be applied to non-Muslims and Muslims alike. - Paris (French: ) is the capital and most populous city of France.

Please answer the following question: As academic work is becoming arguably more precarious and competitive, shorter contracts are becoming the norm, and the number of people completing PhDs in the UK is increasing, the risks associated with researching academia are high. This post discusses and explores my experiences of being a PhD student researching women’s lived experiences of research evaluation in the UK, and my thoughts on and experiences of interviewing very senior and esteemed academics as a junior researcher. My PhD study explored research evaluation in the form of the Research Excellence Framework (REF) – a weighty force in UK academia – the outcomes of which, I argue, hold the potential to alter the course of an academic career considerably, as well as playing a role in the type of work that some academics do, particularly given the REF impact agenda. There is currently an international trend towards research evaluation with programmes such as the Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA), the Performance-Based Research fund in New Zealand (PBRF), and equivalents in countries including Denmark, Switzerland and the Netherlands. What is clear is that there is not enough qualitative, exploratory research into the effects of research evaluation on academic careers, especially for women, and so my PhD study was born. My findings suggest that research evaluation in the UK actively contributes to the continuance of gender inequality regimes in the academy, and that the ability to negotiate managerial control and be politically savvy is increasingly important in the academic world.

Here is a news article: By Ernie Palladino » More Ernie Palladino Columns Sometimes it’s good to change the culture of a sport, if only to save a life or two. There’s nothing complicated about it. We’ve seen football alter its collective behavior throughout the generations, and it’s still changing. The shape and material used in the helmets have evolved since the days when a thin piece of leather served as head protection. Training camp — once the ultimate test of manhood — has gone from a nearly two-month torture chamber of two-a-days where coaches all but doled out water with an eye-dropper to a well-hydrated, single-practice month of tuneup before the regular season. Concussions are no longer thought of as goofy little mishaps that are forgotten once the cobwebs clear — or don’t — to serious occurrences that can shelve a player for a game, two games or more. Hockey has seen the mandatory use of helmets, and baseball has ordered even its first- and third-base coaches to wear head protection. Now, perhaps it is time for Major League Baseball to take another evolutionary step, an advancement that would influence every kid who dreams about becoming the next great thing. It’s time to ban chewing tobacco. Before anyone starts railing about the “sissyfying” of the game, let’s remember that the minors banned tobacco of all kinds from the field and dugouts as far back as 1993. The absence of Red Man from the cheeks of those players hasn’t seemed to affect their performance, as the personnel faucet continues to flow from that primary talent reservoir. Still, it is not uncommon to see some players go back to the chaw as soon as they escape the minor-league restrictions. Somehow, it’s supposed to be cool to mimic a bunch of grizzled old-timers who didn’t know better. The camera catches them on the bench, spitting their ugly brown streams into paper Gatorade cups originally intended for hydration. The fans see the occasional hocking of a lip full of snuff on the field. It’s not only gross, but it can infuriate the grounds crew that has to rub those nasty tobacco juice stains out of artificial turf. But this is about health, not aesthetics or cleaning bills or tradition. We’re talking about tobacco, after all, and that can kill as effectively through mastication as it can inhalation. Tony Gwynn, the legendary San Diego Padres Hall of Famer, died Monday at age 54 because of mouth cancer caused by his addiction to chewing tobacco. Others like Bill Tuttle — the old Tigers utility infielder of the 1950s — tried to spread the same message years ago, and MLB has brought a parade of others to lecture on the dangers of chewing tobacco. But who listens to a bunch of old players without jawbones, tongues, teeth or cheeks? They start as kids. Back in the 1970s, it was nothing to see a high-school coach reach into his back pocket and offer a 17-year-old a chaw. It became a right of passage for many, just part of the journey from teenager to man. Those coaches were as wrong for that as they were for lighting up in the third-base coaching box. Gwynn was just the latest to prove it. It would take nothing for MLB to ban the chaw. The league has already forbidden players from chewing in postgame interviews. Just extend it to the field. If they want to chomp their extra energy away, let them fill their mouths with gum. Fill the cabinets with it until they overflow. Help these multimillion-dollar investments protect their futures by stopping their tobacco usage now. It’s too late for the best pure hitter of our generation. But with a little change in culture, MLB could save others. You May Also Be Interested In These Stories ||||| Tony Gwynn taped a message speaking out against smokeless tobacco use. (Photo: Chris McGrath, Getty Images) OAKLAND – Tony Gwynn's multitude of accomplishments, career batting average of .338 and his pioneering use of video earned him the rapt attention of players whenever he talked baseball. Major League Baseball hopes an even more important message he's delivering posthumously sinks in as well. Gwynn, who died of mouth cancer Monday at 54, speaks out against smokeless tobacco use in a taped segment of an informational video MLB is producing and plans to release this season. The Hall of Fame outfielder believed he developed cancer because of his years-long habit of using spit tobacco, although that was never medically confirmed. Whether Gwynn's untimely death and his stance against smokeless tobacco will curtail its use among players remains an open question. Research by the Pro Baseball Athletic Trainers Society revealed the number of major leaguers who use spit tobacco has declined from about 50% to 33% in the last 20 years. However, that's still about 10 times the amount in the general population, according to the American Cancer Society, whose data from 2012 showed 3.5% of Americans 12 and older – or 9 million – use the highly addictive product. \\"It's definitely ingrained and something that's part of our baseball culture, but it's not exclusive to baseball,'' said Oakland Athletics first baseman Brandon Moss, a non-user. \\"You would hope a figure like (Gwynn), something tragic like that happening, would be a wake-up call for everyone, not just those in baseball. … But most guys are probably going to look at it as the loss of a great man and a great baseball player and leave it at that.'' Indeed, the stance among players seems to be that they're aware of the dangers but, like smoking, it's up to every individual to decide whether to use what remains a legal product. The National Cancer Institute says in its website that smokeless tobacco contains at least 28 chemicals that have been found to cause cancer – typically of the mouth, esophagus and pancreas – and may also lead to heart disease, gum disease and oral lesions. \\"People understand the risks involved and still choose to do it,'' Texas Rangers general manager Jon Daniels said. \\"We all do stupid things, whatever your vice happens to be. People may criticize these guys for dipping, and then somebody's texting and driving.'' And while Gwynn's passing was lamented throughout the game, it doesn't figure to be interpreted by many players – who are usually in their 20s or early 30s, with the concomitant sense of invincibility – as a cautionary tale. \\"It's one of those things that's scary and obviously you hope you're not the one,'' said A's catcher Stephen Vogt, who said he dips once in a while. \\"I don't think it's good. I definitely don't advocate it, but at the same time, it's an adult decision.'' Baseball has taken steps to sway that decision, or at least make the practice less visible to minimize the impact on young fans. The current collective bargaining agreement, in effect from 2012-16, bans players, managers and coaches from using smokeless tobacco during TV interviews and team appearances. And they have to keep tobacco products out of sight while fans are at the ballpark. In addition, MLB and the players union have stepped up educational efforts, and teams – which in the past freely distributed cans of dip in the clubhouse – can no longer do so and are now required to administer oral exams as part of the spring training physicals every year. Longtime TV announcer Joe Garagiola, who quit his smokeless tobacco habit in his 30s, made it his life's mission to warn other baseball folks about its dangers, making presentations during spring training alongside former major league outfielder Billy Tuttle, who died of oral cancer at 69 in 1998. \\"I don't think we talk about it enough anymore,\\" says Atlanta Braves manager Fredi Gonzalez. \\"I remember as a young A-ball manager, Joe Garagiola would always come around in spring training with Bill Tuttle. It was scary. \\"And I still see people chewing tobacco. Not only in the big leagues, but you still see kids in junior high and high school. For me, it's not enough yet. It's a shame.\\" Indeed, the sight of players constantly spitting, some sporting a large wad of tobacco inside their cheek, remains one of the game's enduring images. \\"Every spring training we have a guy that comes in who's had mouth cancer through tobacco,'' Rangers utilityman Donnie Murphy said. \\"So you see it. But at the same time, it's like an addiction thing. You do it for so long, you're going to want to keep doing it.'' Players say using smokeless tobacco provides a form of relaxation and becomes part of their routine in a daily sport with lots of down time. And with amphetamines now banned from baseball, the jolt of energy from the nicotine in the tobacco – absorbed during a longer stretch through dip or chew than by smoking – can help players navigate the season's six-month grind. Commissioner Bud Selig has expressed a desire to banish smokeless tobacco from the majors the same way MLB barred it from the minors starting in 1993. But the issue is subject to collective bargaining and the players association has declined, opting to protect personal freedoms and emphasize education. \\"The MLBPA discourages the use of smokeless tobacco products by its members or by anyone else. These products carry serious health risks, yet remain legally and widely available,'' union spokesman Greg Bouris said via e-mail. \\"In general terms, included in the smokeless tobacco policy negotiated in 2011 are restrictions/prohibitions on its use, increased emphasis on education and cessation programs, as well as oral examinations. At this point in time, player education continues to be a focus of ours.''

Having naturally dark brown hair means that even a single grey hair is very noticeable. From the age of about 22 or 23 I discovered that I had about five grey hairs floating about. As soon as I could see them I'd pull them out. Then, a few months later when they were rearing their ugly heads again - pluck, out they'd come again! Up until I was about 27 or 28 I only had these 5 grey hairs, well that was all I could find anyway. Then from 28 onwards they have been inviting their friends and relatives to move in and I am slowly losing the plucking battle (side note: this increase in grey hairs at 28 was also the year that I got married...I wonder if their is any correlation between getting married and going grey??). Whenever I was having a conversation with someone about grey hairs and I'd mention that I pull mine out, they'd look at me horrified - 'you can't do that, seven more will grow back in its place' they would all warn me. Even my hairdresser was horrified that I plucked my grey hairs. One day when she was straightening my hair I could see a stray grey sticking up and it was driving me crazy. I asked her to pull it out and she refused saying that I'd end up with more if she pulled it out. I have never believed this old wives tale, mostly because for five years I kept plucking my greys yet they didn't increase in number. Plus it made no sense to me. Why would plucking greys cause more greys to grow when the same is not true for your coloured hair. Imagine if it were true - that would mean that the cure for baldness would be to pluck out your hair as each hair you pluck causes seven more to grow in its place - doesn't really make sense, does it?

Answer the following question: What is the final step of the following process: - Bacteria enter the body - Bacteria start to divide and grow - The uncontrolled growth takes away resources from other cells - Other cells cannot function properly - We feel unwell - The growth and division of bacteria produce toxins - Toxins harm the body - The body tries to react to the toxins Answer:","completion":"The final step of the process after the body tries to react to the toxins is the activation of the immune response and recovery or progression towards a severe infection or illness. When harmful bacteria enter the body, they begin multiplying and competing with our cells for resources, resulting in uncontrolled growth and making us feel unwell. As the bacteria continue to grow, they release toxins that harm the body, leading to inflammation and further discomfort. Once the body recognizes these foreign invaders and the toxins they produce, it initiates an immune response to defend against the infection. This response involves a complex series of events, which can be broadly summarized into the following key steps: 1. Activation of the innate immune system: The innate immune response is the first line of defense and involves nonspecific reactions, such as the activation of phagocytic cells (e.g., macrophages and neutrophils) and the release of various signaling molecules called cytokines. These cells and molecules help to promote inflammation and recruit other immune cells to the site of infection for further elimination of the bacteria. 2. Activation of the adaptive immune system: The adaptive immune response is a more specialized reaction that targets specific pathogens, like the harmful bacteria. It involves the activation of T-cells and B-cells, which work together to identify and eliminate the bacteria. T-cells are responsible for killing infected or damaged cells, while B-cells produce antibodies that neutralize and eliminate the bacteria and their toxins. 3. Resolution of the infection: As the immune system successfully carries out its functions, the bacterial population within the body is reduced, and the presence of toxins decreases. Inflammation subsides, and the body begins to heal and repair the damage caused by the infection. Symptoms of illness will gradually improve as the body returns to its normal state. 4. Development of immune memory: Throughout the process, the adaptive immune system generates memory cells that remember the specific bacteria and their associated toxins. This means that if the same bacteria were to enter the body again, the immune system would be able to respond more quickly and effectively to eliminate the threat. It is important to note that the final outcome of this process greatly depends on various factors such as the type and severity of the infection, the individual's overall health, and the strength of their immune system. In some cases, the infection may progress to a more severe illness if the immune response is not effective enough to control the bacteria and their toxins. In such cases, medical intervention and treatment with antibiotics or other appropriate therapies may be needed to assist the immune system in eliminating the infection and facilitating recovery."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: WHY HAVE EMIL AND OLEG COME TO AMERICA ? A bank job Answer:","completion":"Title: \\"Tierra de Oportunidades\\" Emil, a refined con artist, and Oleg, a genius but eccentric hacker, are two Russians who find themselves in the city that never sleeps, New York. The reason for their arrival and the possibility of achieving the American dream pivots around one thing - a high stakes bank job. Step 1: Setting the Backstory. Emil became disillusioned with his life of petty cons in Moscow while Oleg was shunned by society for his hacking skills. An opportunity arises when they stumble upon confidential information exposing a corrupt Wall Street executive using his bank for money laundering. Step 2: Building the Plot. Emil and Oleg decide to steal the laundered money, a deed that could put a dent in the executive's operations. They infiltrate the banking system by posing as wealthy investors. Emil uses his charm to get close to bank employees and gather inside information while Oleg infiltrates the bank's mainframe through his hacking skills. Step 3: Introducing Conflict. Their plan initially goes without a hitch, but everything changes when they steal a bit too much, and the executive finds a shortfall. He hires a savvy private investigator who starts closing in on the duo. At the same time, Emil falls for a bank employee, complicating their mission. Step 4: Approaching Climax. At the climax of the movie, the private investigator exposes Emil and Oleg's operation, resulting in a thrilling car chase through the heart of NYC. The duo manages to temporarily lose the investigator, and they have to strategize a plan to get out of the country with the money. Step 5: The Resolution. A twist enables Emil and Oleg to not only escape but frame the Wall Street executive for their theft while exposing his money laundering operation, thus attracting the attention of the feds. The movie ends with Emil and Oleg escaping to an unidentified location, leaving behind the life of deceit and crime, marking their American venture as a journey of retribution and closure from their past. This movie plot leverages the theme 'Why have Emil and Oleg come to America?' while building around a thrilling 'bank job'. The plot develops tension through complex relationships, big money, crime involvement, and the duo's ultimate escape."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the person who has been characterized by modern scholars as an artist so individual that he belongs to no conventional school?, using the article: Doménikos Theotokópoulos (Greek: Δομήνικος Θεοτοκόπουλος [ðoˈminikos θeotoˈkopulos]; October 1541 – 7 April 1614), most widely known as El Greco (\\"The Greek\\"), was a Greek painter, sculptor and architect of the Spanish Renaissance. \\"El Greco\\" was a nickname, a reference to his Greek origin, and the artist normally signed his paintings with his full birth name in Greek letters, Δομήνικος Θεοτοκόπουλος, Doménikos Theotokópoulos, often adding the word Κρής Krēs, Cretan. El Greco was born in the Kingdom of Candia, which was at that time part of the Republic of Venice, and the center of Post-Byzantine art. He trained and became a master within that tradition before traveling at age 26 to Venice, as other Greek artists had done. In 1570 he moved to Rome, where he opened a workshop and executed a series of works. During his stay in Italy, El Greco enriched his style with elements of Mannerism and of the Venetian Renaissance taken from a number of great artists of the time, notably Tintoretto. In 1577, he moved to Toledo, Spain, where he lived and worked until his death. In Toledo, El Greco received several major commissions and produced his best-known paintings. El Greco's dramatic and expressionistic style was met with puzzlement by his contemporaries but found appreciation in the 20th century. El Greco is regarded as a precursor of both Expressionism and Cubism, while his personality and works were a source of inspiration for poets and writers such as Rainer Maria Rilke and Nikos Kazantzakis. El Greco has been characterized by modern scholars as an artist so individual that he belongs to no conventional school.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Do these questions have the same meaning? Given that you either have an electron or you don't in a flow, could you say that the fundamentals of electronics are binary? Are there any legitimate websites or apps that give away free phones and tablets that any of you tried and got one yourself?","completion":"These two questions are completely different and discuss unrelated topics. Let's dissect and provide a detailed response to each of them separately. Question 1: \\"Given that you either have an electron or you don't in a flow, could you say that the fundamentals of electronics are binary?\\" This question is related to electronics and asking if the fundamental nature of electronics can be described as binary. In order to answer this question, we need to look into the basics of electronic systems. Electronic systems typically rely on the flow of electrons to transmit, process, and store information. The behavior of electrons in a circuit can be governed by various principles like Ohm's Law, Kirchhoff's Laws, and other rules. To simplify the representation of electronic systems, we often use binary logic, which is based on just two states: 0 (low voltage or the absence of an electron) and 1 (high voltage or the presence of an electron). Binary logic is widely used in the design of digital circuits, where the flow of information is represented in the form of bits (0s and 1s). This simplification helps in designing complex electronic systems like integrated circuits, microcontrollers, and microprocessors more efficiently. However, this binary representation does not provide a comprehensive understanding of all aspects of electronics, as there are numerous other components like resistors, capacitors, inductors, and diodes, which have a continuous range of values or states and are crucial in designing analog circuits or systems. Therefore, it can be concluded that while the binary system plays a significant role in simplifying electronic design and data representation, the fundamentals of electronics have a wider scope and can't be limited only to binary principles. Question 2: \\"Are there any legitimate websites or apps that give away free phones and tablets that any of you tried and got one yourself?\\" This question discusses the possibility of receiving free electronic devices such as phones and tablets through websites or apps. To answer this question, we must explore the landscape of promotions, incentives, giveaways, and potential scams surrounding these offers. While there are indeed some promotions or incentives offered by legitimate companies that involve giving away free phones or tablets, these offers are typically tied to certain terms and conditions. For example, a telecommunications provider may offer a free phone if a customer signs a contract for a specified duration. Similarly, a manufacturer or distributor might organize a lucky draw, where participants can enter to win a free tablet if they sign up for a newsletter or make a purchase of some sort. In such cases, you may be required to fulfill certain obligations or make a commitment to the company offering the device. On the other hand, numerous websites and apps claim to give away free gadgets without any legitimate basis. These offers might be scams or phishing schemes, designed to steal personal information or con people out of their money. It is crucial to practice caution and skepticism when encountering these offers, as they often prove too good to be true. In conclusion, while it is possible to encounter a legitimate offer for a free phone or tablet through websites or apps, these offers are typically tied to specific requirements or commitments from customers, and it is imperative to exercise caution when dealing with potentially fraudulent sources."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

In the spring, Edvard Munch’s 1895 work “The Scream,” one of the artist’s now-iconic depictions of terror, sold for 119.9 million at Sotheby’s, setting a record for any work of art sold at auction. This was no “Water Lilies.” We obviously put a high price on our sense of dread. Artists depict and describe what haunts them. Munch’s screamer — set in a swirling landscape, elongated hands holding a face distended in horror — is not so much a portrait as an embodiment of an inner state. Raw fear made flesh. A sort of monster. Monsters serve a purpose in every age. They confront us with qualities in the world, and in ourselves, that we find difficult to face. And without artists to create them — from Gorgon to Godzilla — there would be no monsters at all. The editors asked eight artists to draw a monster that embodies their deepest or most irrational fear — a creature that belongs not to the monsters of history but to their private horrors. This gallery is haunted by a range of fears — of financial ruin, cancer, the abduction of our humanity and even the intimidating haircut. But it also raises perhaps the most frightening specter of all: the monster is us.","completion":"Artists create pictures of scary things called monsters. These monsters show the things that artists are afraid of. A famous artist named Edvard Munch made a picture called \\"The Scream\\" that shows a person who is very scared. This picture was sold for a lot of money. Some other artists were asked to draw monsters that show their own fears. These monsters are scary things that everyone can sometimes feel afraid of.

The White Stripes were an American rock duo formed in 1997 in Detroit, Michigan. The group consisted of Jack White (songwriter, vocals, guitar, piano, and mandolin) and Meg White (drums and vocals). After releasing several singles and three albums within the Detroit music scene, The White Stripes rose to prominence in 2002, as part of the garage rock revival scene. Their successful and critically acclaimed albums White Blood Cells and Elephant drew attention from a large variety of media outlets in the United States and the United Kingdom, with the single \\"Seven Nation Army\\" and its bass line becoming their signature song. The White Stripes' third album, White Blood Cells, was released on July 3, 2001 on Sympathy for the Record Industry. The band enjoyed its first significant success the following year with the major label re-release of the album on V2 Records. Its stripped-down garage rock sound drew critical acclaim in the UK, and in the US soon afterward, making The White Stripes one of the most acclaimed bands of 2002. Several outlets praised their \\"back to basics\\" approach, with Daily Mirror calling them \\"the greatest band since The Sex Pistols.\\" In 2002, Q magazine listed The White Stripes as one of \\"50 Bands to See Before You Die\\". After their first appearance on network TV (a live set on The Late Late Show With Craig Kilborn), Joe Hagan of the New York Times declared, \\"They have made rock rock again by returning to its origins as a simple, primitive sound full of unfettered zeal.\\" White Blood Cells peaked at number 61 on the Billboard 200, reaching Gold record status by selling over 500,000 albums. It reached number 55 in the United Kingdom, being bolstered in both countries by the single \\"Fell in Love with a Girl\\" and its accompanying Lego-animation music video directed by Michel Gondry. The video won three awards at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards: Breakthrough Video, Best Special Effects, and Best Editing, and the band played the song live at the event. It was also nominated for Video of the Year, but fell short of winning. Stylus Magazine rated White Blood Cells as the fourteenth greatest album of 2000-2005, while Pitchfork Media ranked it eighth on their list of the top 100 albums from 2000-2004. In 2002, George Roca produced and directed a concert film about the band titled Nobody Knows How to Talk to Children. It chronicles The White Stripes' four-night stand at New York City's Bowery Ballroom in 2002, and contains live performances and behind-the-scenes footage. Its 2004 release was suppressed by the band's management, however, after they discovered that Roca had been showing it at the Seattle Film Festival without permission.

A widower with a 12-year-old daughter, Elspeth, Honey is sent from Farnborough to investigate the crash of a Rutland Reindeer airliner in Labrador, Canada. He theorizes the accident happened because of the tailplane's structural failure, caused by sudden metal fatigue after 1440 flight hours. To test the theory in his laboratory, a rear airframe is being vibrated at a very high rate in daily eight-hour cycles. It is not until Honey finds himself on board a Reindeer airliner that he realizes he is flying on an early production aircraft that is close to the number of hours his theory projects for the metal fatigue failure. Despite the fact that his theory is not yet proven, he decides to warn the aircrew and Hollywood actress Monica Teasdale, a fellow passenger. After the Reindeer safely lands at Gander Airport in Newfoundland, an inspection clears the aircraft to continue on its route. Honey then takes drastic action to stop the flight by activating the Reindeer's undercarriage lever, dropping the airliner on its belly and seriously damaging it. Shocked by the act, some of his colleagues demand that he be declared insane to discredit his unproved theory and save the reputation of British passenger aviation now awash in a sea of bad press. Teasdale and an airline stewardess Marjorie Corder both take a liking to Mr. Honey and Elspeth, who they discover is lonely and isolated from her schoolmates. Teasdale speaks to Honey's superiors on his behalf, claiming she believes in him. Corder, meanwhile, has stayed on with Honey and his daughter as a nurse.

Answer: Stephen \\"Stevie\\" Ray Vaughan (October 3, 1954 – August 27, 1990) was an American guitarist, singer-songwriter, and record producer. Question: what happened to stevie ray vaughan The answer to this question is:","completion":"Yes, Stephen \\"Stevie\\" Ray Vaughan was an American guitarist, singer-songwriter, and record producer, widely known for his skill in playing the electric guitar. Born on October 3, 1954, in Dallas, Texas, Vaughan rose to prominence as a founding member and leader of the blues-rock band Double Trouble. He is considered one of the most influential and iconic musicians in the blues-rock genre. To address the question, \\"What happened to Stevie Ray Vaughan?\\", we need to delve into his tragic death. On August 27, 1990, Vaughan, along with some other passengers and the pilot, boarded a helicopter after performing in a concert at the Alpine Valley Music Theatre in East Troy, Wisconsin. The helicopter, a Bell 206B JetRanger, was headed to Chicago, which was the next stop on the tour. Tragically, the helicopter crashed into a ski hill shortly after takeoff, killing everyone on board, including Stevie Ray Vaughan who was just 35 years old at the time. The subsequent investigation conducted by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) found that several factors had contributed to the accident, including foggy weather conditions, the pilot's limited experience in flying under such conditions, and the lack of adequate visual references due to the darkness of the night. As a result, the pilot had difficulty navigating, eventually leading to the fatal crash. Although Stevie Ray Vaughan's life and career ended tragically, his music and legacy live on. He has been posthumously inducted into several halls of fame, including the Blues Hall of Fame, the Musicians Hall of Fame, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. His guitar skills, soulful voice, and innovative songwriting have made a lasting impact on the blues and rock music genres, inspiring countless musicians and delighting fans around the world."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I could not agree more with the quote \\"this is one of the best films ever made.\\" If you think Vanilla Sky is simply a \\"re-make,\\" you could not be more wrong. There is tremendous depth in this film: visually, musically, and emotionally. Visually, because the film is soft and delicate at times (early scenes with Sofia) and at other times powerful and intense (Times Square, post-climactic scenes). The music and sounds tie into this movie so perfectly. Without the music, the story is only half told. Nancy Wilson created an emotional, yet eclectic, score for the film which could not be more suitable for such a dream-like theme (although never released, I was able to get my hands on the original score for about 60. If you look hard, you may be able to find a copy yourself). Crowe's other musical selections, such as The Beach Boys, Josh Rouse, Spiritualized, Sigur Ros, the Monkees, etcetera etcetera, are also perfect fits for the film (Crowe has an ear for great music). More importantly, the emotional themes in this film (i.e. love, sadness, regret) are very powerful, and are amplified tenfold by the visual and musical experience, as well as the ingenious dialogue; I admit, the elevator scene brings tears to my eyes time and time again. The best part of this film however (as if it could get any better) is that it is so intelligently crafted such that each time you see the film, you will catch something new--so watch closely, and be prepared to think! Sure, a theme becomes obvious after the first or second watch, but there is always more to the story than you think. This is easily Cameron Crowe's best work, and altogether a work of brilliance. Much of my film-making and musical inspiration comes from this work alone. It has honestly touched my life, as true art has a tendency of doing. It continually surprises me that there are many people that cannot appreciate this film for what it is (I guess to understand true art is an art itself).

However, they are betrayed by Milady, who gives the blueprints to the Duke of Buckingham (Orlando Bloom). Upon returning to France, the Musketeers are forced to disband by Cardinal Richelieu (Christoph Waltz) for their failure.One year later, the young D'Artagnan (Logan Lerman) leaves Gascony for Paris in hopes of becoming a Musketeer, like his father once was, only to learn that they no longer exist. D'Artagnan ends up challenging Captain Rochefort (Mads Mikkelsen), the leader of Richelieu's guard, to a duel after being offended by him, but Rochefort merely shoots him while he's distracted. In an attempt to get revenge, D'Artagnan offends Athos, Porthos and Aramis for petty reasons, and schedules duels with each of them, at the same day and at the same place, but in different times, not knowing who they are.Before they can duel, however, D'Artagnan and the Musketeers are attacked by the guards for breaking the law by having a public duel. They fight the soldiers off, at which point D'Artagnan discovers their true identities, but end up being captured and brought before the young King Louis XIII (Freddie Fox) and his wife, Queen Anne (Juno Temple). Richelieu attempts to convince them to execute the four prisoners, but they are too impressed, and congratulate them instead, much to Richelieu's anger.Later, Richelieu meets with Milady, who is actually working for him. He orders her to plant false love letters among Queen Anne's possessions and steal Queen Anne's diamond necklace and hide it in the Tower of London with the objective of framing Queen Anne of having an affair with the Duke of Buckingham, who is in France on behalf of the King of England, and who has built a fully armed airship using the designs stolen from the Musketeers.

Article: \\"I'm a little worried about my future.\\"said Dustin Hoffman in The Graduate.He should be so lucky.All he had to worry about was whether to have an affair with Mrs. Robinson.In the sixties,that was the total sum of post-graduation anxiety. Hoffman's modem peers are not so fortunate.The Mrs. Robinsons aren't sitting around at home any more.They are out in the workplace,doing the high-powered jobs the graduates want,but cannot get.For those fresh out of university,desperate for work but unable to get it,there is a big imbalance between supply and demand.And there is no narrowing of the gap in sight. Parents feel as badly let down as the young people themselves.Middle-class families see their graduate offspring on the dole queue and wonder why they bothered paying school fees.Working-class families feel an even keener sense of disappointment.For many such families,getting a child into university was the fulfillment of a lifelong dream.It was proof that they were living in a dynamic,economically successful country.That dream does not seem so rosy now.Graduate unemployment is not,ultimately,a political problem.Job-creation for graduates is very low down in the government's schedule.If David Cameron's Conservatives had a brilliant idea for guaranteeing every graduate a well-paid job,they would have presented it by now.It is a social problem,though a more deep-seated social problem than people perhaps realize. Question: The main purpose of the passage is to _ . Options: A: criticize the government B: present a current severe situation C: publicize a movie D: display the success of the country Answer:","completion":"B: present a current severe situation Step-by-step justification: 1. The article starts by referencing a movie from the sixties and the character's worries about his future. 2. It then compares that situation to the modern day, stating that today's graduates face a far greater level of anxiety and challenges. 3. The article discusses the difficulties faced by graduates and their families due to the imbalance of supply and demand for jobs. 4. It highlights that the issue of graduate unemployment is not primarily a political issue, but rather a deep-seated social problem. 5. None of the other options (criticizing the government, publicizing a movie, or displaying the success of the country) are the main focus of the passage. The primary focus is on presenting the current severe situation faced by graduates in the job market."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It is famous as one of the cleanest countries in the world. The Swiss think that recycling is very important. The government has made laws which require everyone to recycle. In 1998, the Swiss government passed a law which says that people can not throw away any electronic machines. Instead, people are told to bring old ones, such as televisions, computers and fridges, to special centers when they didn't need them. Many parts of the old machines are reused, and only the parts that can't be used are thrown away. The government also charges a rubbish bag tax . If people want their rubbish to be collected, they must buy yellow stickers and put them on their rubbish bags. In 2003, 47% of all rubbish in the cities was recycled. This included 70% of paper, 95%of glass, 71%of plastic bottles and 85--90%of cans. Until recently, people could get a small amount of money when they recycled their bottles. Recycling has become a daily habit for the Swiss. Everyone should learn from the Swiss, and our country will be clean like Switzerland.

I like it very much !It will take me away for a while after I am tired . The guitars and songs will take me to mountains and fields. Country music usually talks of everyday life and feelings.

Many of songs tell about the lives of famers . They talk about love, crops or death. The life of the countryside can be hard, so the words in country music are often sad. At first, people played the music only at family parties. But it became more popular later. In the 1920s,people played country songs on the radio, and they made them into records. When people in the countryside moved to towns and cities to look for work, they took their music with them. Country music continued to change and became popular across America.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: Because toddlers are so inquisitive, they may try to open doors. If your front door is unlocked and your child opens it, he or she could wander out into the world. To prevent this, you can buy special child-proof doorknob covers that will keep your child from opening the door. These covers usually need to be squeezed from two sides in order to grip the doorknob and allow it to be turned. Toddlers cannot wrap their small hands around the covers and squeeze them sufficiently to turn the knob. However, these covers should not be the only method used to keep toddlers from getting out of the home. Some ingenious toddlers figure out how to bypass these covers by inserting their finger into the hole in the cover and manipulating the doorknob or actually managing to remove the doorknob cover entirely. An added measure of security on doors is to lock them, preferably using two locks. Any doors that could lead to danger for toddlers should be locked. This includes doors to stairs and balconies as well as any other rooms that pose a hazard. Although coffee tables are functional and look nice, they are also the cause of many head injuries to toddlers that fall near them. If you would prefer not to remove the coffee table from the room, you can pad the edges and corners with a soft material. This can be done with special soft, plastic corner protectors that you can generally purchase at home furnishing stores. There are also protective strips that can be used along the side edges of the coffee table. One strangulation hazard that many people overlook is the pull cords on curtains, shades, and blinds. These long strings are usually hidden from sight, but toddlers are notorious for finding things that they are not supposed to find. There are special cord holders that wind the cord up short and keep it securely hidden in a plastic case so it stays out of reach. You can purchase these at your local home furnishing store. Kids generally love to climb so keep your child from climbing up to the window by moving your furniture around. Move any furniture that is near a window so that your child cannot reach the window and accidentally fall out Consider getting a lock that does not let you open the window more than a few inches. This way the child will not be able to open the windows and drop through it. Sometimes, light-weight furniture that has hard surfaces can cause injuries. Toddlers might try to use the furniture to assist them in standing or try to climb up onto the furniture. Their weight causes the furniture to topple and sometimes fall onto the toddler. Summary:","completion":"Little kids are very curious and sometimes they might try to open doors or play with things they shouldn't. To keep them safe, you can use special doorknob covers, lock doors, and protect them from sharp coffee table edges. Also, make sure long cords from curtains or blinds are hidden away, and rearrange furniture to keep them from climbing and opening windows. Be careful with light-weight furniture that might tip over when they try to stand or climb on it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This one just happens to be funny. We had “open critiques” in art school. The idea was A- to point out how we could do it better, and B- to toughen us up for the advertising world. It’s brutal, cruel, and cutthroat, and get ready for your stupid clients to ruin your tasteful design and fuck it all kinds of up to put a picture of their ugly-ass crotch dropping on there, or a huge starburst that says “SALE SALE SALE!”. You had to learn not to care, and do your fulfilling artwork on the side. It’s just a job; nothing personal. We were in the middle of a critique, and it was turning ugly. The only time our professor would jump in was if it turned personal. It had. He laid back and let us fight it out, until someone told the girl we were critiquing that “with your taste from growing up in a trailer park, looks like you’ll be working for the Auto Trader” (a shitty, newsprint magazine that people sell used cars in- the worst of the worst design jobs). Before our professor could comment, I blurted out “For fuck’s sake, Mom….” I was about to say “tell them to break it the fuck up!” until the laughter started. Then I realized I’d called my professor, who had an MFA and spent 20 years in advertising at Saatchi and Saatchi, “Mom”. He responded with such amazing, quick wit; “Ms. Hood, I admire your devotion to your mother; just remember she stays home while you come to class.” I caught hell for it that entire semester. Luckily, we (almost) all had pretty tough skins, so it was amusing, even to our somewhat staid professor. He wrote on my end of semester assessment “Respectfully, Not Your Mom.” I still keep that assessment to remind me to wear life like a loose garment.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. The answer is:","completion":"No, the answer found on Google does not directly address or answer the question \\"when did expos become nationals.\\" While it is true that the Washington Nationals are a professional baseball team based in Washington, D.C., this statement does not provide the specific information requested. The Montreal Expos officially became the Washington Nationals when they relocated from Montreal, Quebec, Canada, to Washington, D.C., in 2005. The process started in 2004 when Major League Baseball (MLB) announced that the Expos would move to Washington, D.C., for the 2005 season. Several factors, including poor attendance and the lack of a suitable stadium, contributed to the Expos' relocation to Washington. The change in location led to a rebranding effort, as the team adopted a new name, logo, and team colors. On November 22, 2004, the team officially became the Washington Nationals. As part of their rebranding, they took on the colors of red, white, and navy blue, aligning with the United States' national colors, and introduced the \\"Nationals\\" nickname, which was a nod to the two MLB teams that previously played in Washington—the Senators and Nationals. The Washington Nationals played their first game in their new city on April 4, 2005, against the Philadelphia Phillies. The Nationals' home games were initially played at Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium before moving to the newly built Nationals Park in 2008. In conclusion, the Montreal Expos became the Washington Nationals when they relocated from Montreal to Washington, D.C., in 2005, but the provided answer lacks the specific information needed to address the question accurately. The correct information is that the Expos officially became the Nationals in November 2004, with their first season in Washington, D.C., taking place in 2005."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: I can use this background: Alkali, or Alkaline, soils are clay soils with high pH (> 8.5), a poor soil structure and a low infiltration capacity. Often they have a hard calcareous layer at 0.5 to 1 metre depth. Alkali soils owe their unfavorable physico-chemical properties mainly to the dominating presence of sodium carbonate, which causes the soil to swell[1] and difficult to clarify/settle. They derive their name from the alkali metal group of elements, to which sodium belongs, and which can induce basicity. Sometimes these soils are also referred to as alkaline sodic soils. Alkaline soils are basic, but not all basic soils are alkaline. Now, I have a new situation: Pat has 2 acres of land next to Tim's property. Tim's land is of similar size. The clay soil on Tim's property is very alkaline, so he had to amend it with aluminum salts to make it more acidic in order to grow crops. The soil on Pat's parcel has a good structure and high infiltration capacity. Pat gets twice as much food of his land every year. Answer this question please: Which soil from these two parcels has a poor structure? Answer:","completion":"The soil with a poor structure belongs to Tim's property. In the given background, it is mentioned that alkali or alkaline soils are clay soils with high pH (> 8.5), a poor soil structure, and a low infiltration capacity. These soils are dominated by sodium carbonate, which causes them to swell and become difficult to manage. Tim's property is described as having very alkaline clay soil, which indicates that it has the unfavorable physico-chemical properties associated with alkali soils, including a poor structure. On the other hand, Pat's parcel of land is described as having soil with a good structure and high infiltration capacity. This suggests that Pat's soil is not affected by the issues that typically come with alkali soils, such as poor structure. As a result, Pat's land is more productive, allowing him to harvest twice as much food each year compared to Tim. In summary, the soil with a poor structure is found on Tim's property, while Pat's property has soil with a good structure and high infiltration capacity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I certainly tired of reading The Bear and the Dragon. A friend recommended that I read this novel because of the recent diplomatic problems with China and the American spy plane. The book pales in comparison to the real drama.Jack Ryan has been a great character in the previous novels. In this one, his age shows badly. He's a character that has lost his shine. In the story, Ryan has reluctantly run for and been elected to the presidency. He doesn't really like his job. By the end, I wish he had just resigned.

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"The two sentences seem to be in direct contrast to one another, making it highly unlikely for both to be true simultaneously. Let us examine each sentence more carefully to understand their implications and the nature of their relationship. Sentence 1: \\"As the weeks went by, the state of Poirot's nerves grew worse and worse.\\" The first sentence suggests a progressive deterioration in Poirot's mental state. As time passes, Poirot's nerves continue to get frayed, indicating his anxiousness and stress are escalating. Sentence 2: \\"Poirot's anxiety was fading away as the weeks went by.\\" On the other hand, the second sentence conveys exactly the opposite notion. It implies that Poirot's anxiousness is decreasing, and his mental health is improving over time. Given the contradictory nature of these statements, it is practically impossible for both to be true simultaneously. If, indeed, the first sentence is true, meaning Poirot's nerves are growing worse with each passing week, the second sentence would not be valid, since Poirot's anxiety could not be fading away at the same time. In conclusion, if the first sentence is true, the second sentence would be false since they both present opposing ideas about Poirot's mental state.

Article: 'Amy and I loved each other in an unhealthy, co-dependent way,' says Winehouse's ex-husband Blake Fielder-Civil By Alanah Eriksen Last updated at 11:01 PM on 31st July 2011 Amy Winehouse's ex-husband has revealed his relationship with the singer was 'unhealthy and co-dependent' because they always fought over drugs. Black Fielder-Civil, who was not granted a short release from jail to attend the singer's funeral, opened up for a documentary to screen on Thursday. He said: 'We loved each other intensely and probably in a really unhealthy co-dependent way and we probably called it all sorts of things, passionate, fiery and whatever but sexually it was spot-on, I guess. 'You can’t have a relationship and be a heroin addict, you can’t. If you don’t have access to money you’re going out thieving and you’re going to be in jail half the time, it’s not a way to live. Happier times: Amy Winehouse and her ex-husband Blake Fielder-Civil seen laughing and joking in 2007 'You can’t sustain love for each other when you’re constantly fighting over a bit of gear.' Blake, 32, denied claims he was responsible for the singer's spiral into drugs but admitted he was there the first time Amy took heroin. 'She took to it like a duck to water, the same as me,' he said. 'It is what it is for a reason, it’s an addictive thing and it makes you feel good. I can’t say how she felt but if it was anything like me then yes, she seemed to enjoy it.' Toxic: Blake revealed Amy had self-harmed after she saw him doing the same whille the pair argued at a hotel in London The grieving addict, who was married to Amy for two years before they divorced in 2009, said he was still in regular contact with the the star. She had even called him a day before she died to beg him to let her visit. He also revealed in Amy Winehouse : The Untold Story - to screen on Channel 5 on Thursday - what had happened when the couple were pictured roaming Soho covered in blood in 2007. 'We had a mad argument, we was out of our nuts and I smashed a bottle and took a chunk out of myself. 'She just looked at me and out of fear or love or whatever it was and, out of some weird sense of loyalty, she did the same thing to herself. I was quite pissed off and I said ‘What the f**k’!'' Fiery couple: The pair went everywhere together before they divorced in 2009 Blake is currently serving 32 months in Armley Prison, Leeds, for breaking into a house with a fake gun. Meanwhile, one of Amy's friends, glamour model Aisleyne Horgan-Wallace, has revealed Amy dreamed of marrying boyfriend Reg Traviss, 35, and having children. She told The People : 'She would ­always tell me that she wanted nothing more than to be a housewife Strong friendship: Amy with her glamour model pal Aisleyne Horgan-Wallace, who revealed the singer wanted to marry her boyfriend Reg Traviss 'She wanted to have children and stay at home and look after them. 'The fame didn’t bother her, she didn’t crave that, she was about the love of music. Grieving: Aisleyne says Amy wanted to marry her boyfriend Reg Traviss, seen here outside Amy's house after her death 'Whether it was in front of millions or it was just in a local pub, she was just happy performing and what she really wanted was to have a family. 'She loved Reg and hoped she would spend the rest of her life with him. Reg was great for her, he was a positive in her life, we all thought so – her friends, family and record ­company bosses. 'It is so awful she died just when she had sorted things out and was in the happiest place I had ever seen her.' Aisleyne did not attend Amy's funeral and has been accused of partying with her days before she died. 'I am now saying goodbye to Amy in my own way. 'I was told there wasn’t enough space at the funeral but then her parents thought I was out partying with her in the days before she died. 'I wasn’t. I hadn’t seen Amy for a good few weeks before she died. 'I am doing this interview so people remember Amy the way I do. 'I want to grieve for my friend, who had a huge heart and is the best artist of my lifetime.' Aisleyne was seen curled in a ball crying outside Amy's flat after receiving the news of her death.

Now Amy Winehouse's posthumous third album will give a blow-by-blow account of the tumultuous years that followed, telling of the marriage and divorce from drug addict Blake Fielder-Civil. It maps her decline into alcohol and drug addiction that contributed to her death last Saturday. Lovers: Blake Fielder-Civil with Amy Winehouse pictured in 2007 A spokesman for Amy's family said that throughout last year she had been working on a follow-up to her last release, 2006's critically acclaimed Back To Black. 'Amy always had a notebook on her and would write down lyrics and ideas,' he said. 'People who have heard the new songs say that they are very, very good and that they are as autobiographical as ever. 'The period after 2006 was when Amy went through the most emotional upheaval, with Blake going to prison and then their divorce.' Fielder-Civil, 33, was jailed for seven months in 2008 after an attack on a pub landlord. The two-year marriage ended in divorce in 2009. 'In loving memory': A bottle of Vodka is left among the tributes outside the home of Amy Winehouse after the singer died yesterday of a suspected drug overdose 'Your in our hearts': Tributes tied to the fence near Winehouse's Camden home Amy, who died aged 27 at her £1.8 million North London home, had been working on the third album with Miami-based producer Salaam Remi throughout the last year. She had recorded up to a dozen songs during a working trip to Jamaica. Most of the songs are demos, for which Amy penned lyrics and laid down a backing track. Sources said it was likely they would be released next year, using Amy's vocals or contributions from friends, with proceeds going to a charity set up by her father Mitch to help others struggling with addiction. Mr Remi, who co-produced Back To Black, said the new album was still a 'work in progress'. Heyday: Since her death, Winehouse's second album, Back To Black, has topped the charts in 17 countries Meanwhile, Amy is said to have been worth £6 million when she died, much of it in companies overseen by her father. Industry insiders now put that fortune at £10 million – and rising – because of lucrative tours before her death and sales after it. One said: 'We are seeing the creation of an international cult around Amy. The fortune it creates could top £60 million or more.' Since her death, Back To Black has topped the iTunes charts in 17 countries. ||||| THE fixer who says he met Amy Winehouse the night before she died claimed yesterday he was terrified of the “Mr Big” drug dealer he hooked her up with. Tony Azzopardi is due to be re-interviewed by detectives today after alleging he took the troubled singer to buy crack cocaine and heroin. The 56-year-old, who says he became friends with Amy, 27, through her former husband Blake Fielder-Civil, has promised to do all he can to help police piece together her final hours. Tony Azzopardi He said: “I want Amy’s family to know the truth about what happened. I want to help them out – but I’m worried about my safety.” He said he was nervous about possible “comebacks” from the dealer, describing him as a local “Mr Big” in the Camden area of North London. Several people claim to have seen Amy outside Camden bar The Good Mixer a week ago on Friday evening, the night before she was found dead. Azzopardi claims she pulled alongside him in a black cab as he walked near a pub called The Eagle at 11.30pm. He says she asked him to help her buy drugs and they went in the taxi to West Hampstead, where he made a call to a dealer from a phone box. As they waited, he says Amy told him she was annoyed that Fielder-Civil had been ringing her from prison, and “hassling” her. Azzopardi said the dealer, who he claims was known to Amy, arrived in a car and handed over drugs. He says she paid £1,200 for half an ounce of crack and the same of heroin. Later, he says, she dropped him off in nearby Archway before she went home in the early hours of Saturday. Amy was found at 4pm that day. Police said they found no evidence of drugs or drug ­paraphenalia in her home. Doctors revealed she had been dead for several hours. Azzopardi, who has a long list of convictions and a history of drink and drug abuse, said: “When Amy dropped me off, she gave me a kiss on the cheek and that was it – the last time I saw her.” He added: “She looked good, you know, fit – like she’d been clean for a while and filled out a bit. I couldn’t believe it when I found out she was gone.” But the Winehouse family last night said they were not convinced his account fitted with Amy’s movements. They believe she died of a seizure or heart attack because her body couldn’t handle the shock of quitting booze and going “cold turkey”. Amy’s dad Mitch, 60, says she stayed at home and played drums on the eve of the tragedy. He told at her funeral how she had weaned herself off drugs and was making a “fantastic recovery”. A postmortem proved inconclusive and it will be some weeks before results of toxicology tests may reveal the cause of death. Tim Bittlestone, of solicitors Leslie Franks, said: “Myself and Azzopardi attended Kentish Town police station. We will speak to them again on Monday.” The Met police refused to comment. |||||Summary:","completion":"Amy Winehouse's ex-husband, Blake Fielder-Civil, said that their relationship was not healthy because they always fought over drugs.

Ron and I had tried to have children for a long time with depressing results. I threw myself into my work. Any maternal feelings I had were spent on Merlin. I couldn't wait to get home from work each night. I wanted to pick up that warm bundle of loving fur and nestle him. I wanted to sing \\"Rock-a-bye Merlin\\", as I did every night as he would put his paws around my neck. Merlin was my comfort especially at times when I wondered if God was listening. But last night something had changed. Not only did I sing \\"Rock-a-Bye Merlin\\", but I asked, \\"What will I do after you're gone?\\" Although Merlin was 19 years old, a senior in the age of a cat, he didn't look or act that way. I didn't want to accept the fact that he was nearing the end of his lifetime. My job at the law firm was so demanding and stressful that I couldn't imagine getting through the day without Merlin waiting to greet me at home. I dialed the vet's number. I asked for my husband but he already left. Then I took a breath and asked the question that no one wants to ask, \\"Is my Merlin still alive?\\" The nurse said \\"yes.\\" Ron came home and said that Merlin had almost no red blood cells left. White blood cells were replacing them. Merlin would need expensive transfusions most likely on a monthly basis. We both knew Merlin was running out of time. I asked Ron to drive me to the vet so I could say goodbye to my little boy cat but he was beat tired and it was late. Ron said if Merlin was still alive the next morning then he would take me to the vet. _ Merlin had survived the night. After driving to the vet, I went into the examining room.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Can you tell me the answer to apolipoprotein e4 appears to play a role in??","completion":"Apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) is a specific isoform of apolipoprotein E, which is a protein crucial for the transport and metabolism of lipids in the body. The main role of ApoE is to mediate the binding of lipoprotein particles to specific receptors on the surface of cells. These particles help in the transfer and exchange of plasma lipids, such as triglycerides and cholesterol, among various tissues. ApoE exists in three common isoforms: ApoE2, ApoE3, and ApoE4, with ApoE3 being the most common isoform. ApoE4 has been associated with several health issues, most notably with an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease and cardiovascular diseases. Here is a detailed discussion of the specific roles in which ApoE4 appears to play: 1. Alzheimer's Disease: Out of the three isoforms of ApoE, ApoE4 poses the highest risk of late-onset Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Compared to ApoE3, individuals with one copy of the ApoE4 allele have a 2-4 fold increased risk of developing AD, while those with two copies of the ApoE4 allele have a 10-15 fold increased risk. A few mechanisms by which ApoE4 contributes to AD include: a. Amyloid-beta (Aβ) metabolism: ApoE4 has a reduced ability to clear amyloid-beta, a peptide that accumulates and forms toxic aggregates in Alzheimer's patients. Accumulated Aβ contributes to neuronal dysfunction, inflammation, and ultimately, neurodegeneration in the brain. b. Neuroinflammation: ApoE4 has an increased ability to activate microglial cells, a type of brain-resident immune cell. This activation triggers inflammation and may exacerbate AD pathology. c. Lipoprotein dysfunction: ApoE4 may impede the normal processes of transporting and recycling lipids in the brain, contributing to the impaired function of neuronal membranes and synaptic connections, which play a critical role in memory and learning. 2. Cardiovascular Diseases: Clinical studies have demonstrated a strong correlation between the presence of ApoE4 and the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases (CVD), including atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, and cerebrovascular disorders. Potential mechanisms linking ApoE4 with CVD risk include: a. Alteration of lipoprotein metabolism: ApoE4 has been related to an increased level of plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and a reduction of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). High LDL-C values and low HDL-C concentrations are well-established risk factors for CVD. b. Increased oxidative stress: The presence of ApoE4 has been associated with higher levels of oxidative stress, which may lead to a higher rate of oxidative modification of LDL particles, a process that contributes to the development of atherosclerosis. c. Pro-inflammatory effects: ApoE4 may augment inflammation within the arterial wall, promoting the formation of atherosclerotic plaques and eventually leading to CVD. In conclusion, ApoE4 appears to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease and cardiovascular diseases through several mechanisms, including alteration of lipid metabolism, impaired amyloid-beta clearance, increased neuroinflammation, and contributions to oxidative stress and inflammation in the vasculature. Understanding the mechanisms behind the harmful effects of ApoE4 is essential for developing targeted therapeutics and preventive strategies for individuals at risk of these diseases."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In 1900 the world's use of paper was about one kilogram for each person in a year. Now some countries use 50 kilograms of paper for each person in a year. But countries like America, England and Sweden certainly use more paper than other countries. Paper was first made in China about 2000 years ago. It was made from the hair-like parts of certain plants. Paper was not made in southern Europe until about the year 1100. In 1500, a German named Schaeffer found out that one could make the best paper from trees. After that the forest countries of Canada, Sweden, America, Finland became the most important ones in paper making. When we think of paper, we think of newspapers, books and writing paper. But there are many other uses. Only half of the paper is used for books and things like that. Paper is very good for keeping you warm. Houses are often insulated(, ) with paper. You may see some men asleep on a large number of newspapers. They're insulating themselves from the cold. In Finland the temperature is sometimes -40 centigrade (C). The farmers wear paper boots in the snow. Nothing could be warmer. Each year more and more things are made of paper. We have had paper cups and plates for a long time.

The Li family belonged to the northwest military aristocracy prevalent during the Sui dynasty and claimed to be paternally descended from the Daoist founder, Laozi (whose personal name was Li Dan or Li Er) the Han dynasty General Li Guang and Western Liang ruler Li Gao. This family was known as the Longxi Li lineage (Li lineage; 隴西李氏), which includes the Tang poet Li Bai. The Tang Emperors also had Xianbei maternal ancestry, from Emperor Gaozu of Tang's Xianbei mother, Duchess Dugu. Li Yuan was Duke of Tang and governor of Taiyuan, modern Shanxi, during the Sui dynasty's collapse, which was caused in part by the Sui failure to conquer the northern part of the Korean peninsula during the Goguryeo–Sui War. He had prestige and military experience, and was a first cousin of Emperor Yang of Sui (their mothers were sisters). Li Yuan rose in rebellion in 617, along with his son and his equally militant daughter Princess Pingyang (d. 623), who raised and commanded her own troops. In winter 617, Li Yuan occupied Chang'an, relegated Emperor Yang to the position of Taishang Huang or retired emperor, and acted as regent to the puppet child-emperor, Yang You.

For nearly two weeks, the company’s official Twitter account has been directing users to a fake lookalike website, the sole purpose of which is to expose Equifax’s reckless response to the breach. Advertisement After announcing the breach, Equifax directed its customers to equifaxsecurity2017.com, a website where they can enroll in identity theft protection services and find updates about how Equifax is handing the “cybersecurity incident.” But the decision to create “equifaxsecurity2017” in the first place was monumentally stupid. The URL is long and it doesn’t look very official—that means it’s going to be very easy to emulate. Fake versions of the site could be used to phish Equifax customers and steal their personal information, again. A much safer choice would have been to create a subdomain on the Equifax website (equifax.com) and direct users there.

(He simply switched the words “security” and “equifax” around.) Sweeting’s website looks slightly different than the official Equifax website, as you can see below, but only because he isn’t actually trying to dupe anyone: Sweeting’s intentions clearly aren’t malicious. If anything, he’s trying to demonstrate why Equifax needs to shut down its website, or at least transfer it elsewhere, so it isn’t further exposing consumers to risk. Advertisement As if to demonstrate Sweeting’s point, Equifax appears to have been itself duped by the fake URL. The company has directed users to Sweeting’s fake site sporadically over the past two weeks. Gizmodo found eight tweets containing the fake URL dating back to September 9th: Each of the tweets containing Sweeting’s URL is signed by someone at Equifax named “Tim.” The latest tweet was sent out September 19th.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. The answer is:","completion":"No, the answer found on Google does not directly address the question about what is wrong with Gary Busey's face. While the answer provides information about Gary Busey's career and some of the films and TV shows he has been a part of, it does not mention anything about his facial appearance. In 1988, Gary Busey was involved in a serious motorcycle accident in which he was not wearing a helmet. As a result, he suffered major head injuries and underwent neurosurgery. The accident left his face partially paralyzed, and the recovery process led to some changes in Busey's facial appearance. The residual effects of the accident and surgery may cause his face to look different from what it did before the accident, contributing to the perception that there is something \\"wrong\\" with his face. Additionally, like anyone else, Gary Busey has aged over the years, which can cause changes in facial features due to the natural aging process. This, combined with the aftermath of his accident, may contribute to the unique appearance of his face.

For a French composer of the 19th century, opera was seen as the most important type of music. Saint-Saëns's younger contemporary and rival, Massenet, was beginning to gain a reputation as an operatic composer, but Saint-Saëns, with only the short and unsuccessful La princesse jaune staged, had made no mark in that sphere. In February 1877, he finally had a full-length opera staged. His four-act \\"drame lyricque\\", Le timbre d'argent (\\"The Silver Bell\\"), to Jules Barbier's and Michel Carré's libretto, reminiscent of the Faust legend, had been in rehearsal in 1870, but the outbreak of war halted the production. The work was eventually presented by the Théâtre Lyrique company of Paris; it ran for eighteen performances.The dedicatee of the opera, Albert Libon, died three months after the premiere, leaving Saint-Saëns a large legacy \\"To free him from the slavery of the organ of the Madeleine and to enable him to devote himself entirely to composition\\". Saint-Saëns, unaware of the imminent bequest, had resigned his position shortly before his friend died. He was not a conventional Christian, and found religious dogma increasingly irksome; he had become tired of the clerical authorities' interference and musical insensitivity; and he wanted to be free to accept more engagements as a piano soloist in other cities. After this he never played the organ professionally in a church service, and rarely played the instrument at all. He composed a Messe de Requiem in memory of his friend, which was performed at Saint-Sulpice to mark the first anniversary of Libon's death; Charles-Marie Widor played the organ and Saint-Saëns conducted. In December 1877, Saint-Saëns had a more solid operatic success, with Samson et Dalila, his one opera to gain and keep a place in the international repertoire. Because of its biblical subject, the composer had met many obstacles to its presentation in France, and through Liszt's influence the premiere was given at Weimar in a German translation.

What is the most logical completion of this news story?. With its grandiose architecture, 10ft tall chandeliers and ornate plasterwork this former movie theater was once a symbol of Detroit's growing wealth, without peers within the city for its elegance and grandness. But the once glorious and now decrepit Michigan Building currently stands a shadow of its former self - saved only from the wrecking ball after it was turned into a car park. The theater, with its French Renaissance-style decor, was developed on the site of Henry Ford's first automobile workshop in 1925 at a cost of about 3.5million - roughly 46million today. Grand: The once glorious and now decrepit Michigan Building currently stands a shadow of its former self - it was built as a 4,000-capacity movie theater but is now used as a car park and includes office and retail space Industrial decline: However, the 1,000 sq ft theater's fortunes mirrored the decline in industry in the once mighty OPTIONS: - Detroit - French Renaissance - Henry Ford - Michigan Building","completion":"Detroit, and as the economic downturn gripped the city in the latter half of the 20th century, the Michigan Building faced numerous challenges. The theater, which was once a beacon of prosperity, started having trouble attracting audiences, and its maintenance costs became increasingly difficult to manage. As a result, the theater closed its doors in the 1970s, and the building faced an uncertain future. Despite several attempts to repurpose the space, including a brief stint as a concert venue, the Michigan Building struggled to find an identity. It wasn't until the early 2000s that a local businessman and entrepreneur, seeing potential in the historic building and realizing the need for new parking facilities in the area, devised a plan to transform the Michigan Building into a multi-level car park. The ambitious project aimed to preserve the building's architectural and historical integrity while making it functional for modern use. The building's structure was reinforced, and portions of it were carefully converted into office and retail spaces alongside the parking facility. The result is an intriguing mix of old and new, with the once-magnificent theater now serving a distinctly utilitarian purpose. Though the Michigan Building's current state is far from its former glory, the creative solution has given the building a lifeline and has prevented it from being demolished entirely. It stands as a monument of Detroit's industrial past and a testament to the city's ability to adapt and survive through challenging times. As the city works towards revitalizing its downtown core, projects like the Michigan Building are playing a crucial role in both preserving the area's rich history and meeting the needs of a modern urban population. While it may be difficult to imagine the building ever returning to its original purpose as a lavish theater, city officials and preservationists hope that as Detroit continues to rebuild, there may be new opportunities to restore and revitalize more of these historic landmarks. Efforts are now being directed towards finding investors and developers who share the same vision of breathing new life into these structures, ideally for adaptive reuse, so that they can once again become integral to the city's cultural fabric. In conclusion, the most logical completion of the news story is that the 1,000 sq ft theater's fortunes mirrored the decline in industry in the once mighty Detroit. The theater's transition from a symbol of prosperity to a relatively utilitarian facility serves as a stark reminder of the city's turbulent history while also showcasing its resilience and resourcefulness in the face of adversity. As redevelopment initiatives in Detroit continue, there is hope that the Michigan Building and other historic structures may yet reclaim some of the splendor they once possessed."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: What is the final step of the following process: - Magma comes up to the surface of the earth - The magma cools - Particles inside the magma move closer together - Crystals are formed The answer is:","completion":"The final step in the process involving the formation of crystals from magma is the solidification of these crystals into igneous rock. To elaborate further on this process, let's break it down step by step: 1. Magma comes up to the surface of the earth: Magma is molten rock that forms beneath the Earth's surface due to the intense heat and pressure exerted on the rocks. When the magma is forced to the surface, it is called lava. This can occur through volcanic eruptions, fault lines, or fissures in the Earth's crust. 2. The magma cools: Once lava reaches the Earth's surface, it is exposed to cooler temperatures and the atmosphere, which cause it to cool down. The rate at which the lava cools depends on various factors such as the composition of the magma, its temperature, and the surrounding environment. The cooling process can take from a few hours to thousands of years. 3. Particles inside the magma move closer together: As the magma cools, its particles lose energy and move closer together. This process is known as nucleation, and it involves the formation of small, solid clusters within the liquid magma. These clusters act as nuclei, or starting points, for the growth of crystal structures. 4. Crystals are formed: The process of crystal formation, called crystallization, occurs as the magma continues to cool and the solid nuclei attract more particles from the surrounding liquid. This attraction leads to the development of a regular, repeating arrangement of atoms in a crystalline lattice structure. The types of crystals that form depend on the composition of the magma, with different minerals crystallizing at specific temperatures and under certain conditions. 5. Solidification of the crystals into igneous rock: The final step in this process is the solidification of the crystalline structures into a coherent mass, which forms an igneous rock. This solidification occurs as the magma cools further, and the remaining liquid is either incorporated into the crystals or forms tiny pockets within the rock. The texture and appearance of the igneous rock are dependent on the rate of cooling, the composition of the magma, and the size and arrangement of the formed crystals. When the cooling occurs slowly beneath the Earth's surface, coarse-grained plutonic rocks like granite are formed. Conversely, when cooling occurs quickly at or near the surface, fine-grained volcanic rocks like basalt or obsidian are formed. In summary, the final step of the stated process is the solidification of crystals into an igneous rock when the magma has cooled sufficiently, and the remaining liquid is either incorporated into the crystals or forms pockets within the rock. This results in a variety of igneous rocks, which can be classified based on their texture, composition, and other factors."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church. - The Catholic Church, also known as the Roman Catholic Church, is the largest Christian church, with more than 1.27 billion members worldwide. As one of the oldest religious institutions in the world, it has played a prominent role in the history of Western civilisation. Headed by the Bishop of Rome, known as the pope, its doctrines are summarised in the Nicene Creed. The Catholic Church is notable within Western Christianity for its sacred tradition and seven sacraments. - Branimir ( Latin : Brannimero ) was a ruler of the Duchy of Croatia who reigned as duke ( knez ) from 879 to 892 . His country received papal recognition as a state from Pope John VIII on 7 June 879 . During his reign , Croatia retained its sovereignty from both Frankish and Byzantine rule and became de jure independent . - In ecclesiastical heraldry, papal coats of arms (those of individual popes) and those of the Holy See and Vatican City State include an image of crossed keys to represent the metaphorical keys of the office of Saint Peter, the keys of heaven, or the keys of the kingdom of Heaven, that, according to Roman Catholic teaching, Jesus promised to Saint Peter, empowering him to take binding actions. In the Gospel of Matthew , Jesus says to Peter, \\"I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven.\\" The keys of heaven or keys of Saint Peter are seen as a symbol of papal authority: \\"Behold he [Peter] received the keys of the kingdom of heaven, the power of binding and loosing is committed to him, the care of the whole Church and its government is given to him [cura ei totius Ecclesiae et principatus committitur (Epist., lib. V, ep. xx, in P.L., LXXVII, 745)]\\". - The pope (from \\"pappas\\", a child's word for \\"father\\") is the Bishop of Rome and, therefore, the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI. 'branimir of croatia' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'religion'?

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Judge: \\"An application of this nature is never taken lightly... It is an integral part of a fair trial\\" The judge in the trial of South African Paralympic athlete Oscar Pistorius has ordered that he should undergo a month-long mental evaluation. She ruled that psychiatric evidence before the court could not replace \\"a proper inquiry\\" into his mental health. Correspondents say the trial, which began in March, will almost certainly now face a lengthy delay. The prosecution argued on Tuesday that psychiatric tests were essential and that he should be referred. Analysis Two days ago, Oscar Pistorius told me the prosecution's demand that he undergo further psychiatric tests was \\"a joke\\". His defence lawyer was practically spitting with indignation in court as he argued against it. But today - after hearing Judge Masipa's thorough, detailed ruling - all sides seemed to accept, or at least pretend to accept, that she had a point and that another long delay in this already extended trial would not be a disaster. It is an odd moment - and one that seems to have caught almost everyone I have spoken to by surprise. Remember that neither prosecution nor defence is suggesting that Mr Pistorius is mentally ill. But the prosecution is clearly concerned by the defence psychiatrist's claim that the athlete's behaviour the night he killed Reeva Steenkamp might have been influenced by his \\"general anxiety disorder\\". If the state experts confirm that medical diagnosis then the defence has lost nothing but time. The experts could even go further, suggesting Mr Pistorius had diminished responsibility for his actions. But if, after 30 days of evaluation, the doctors conclude that Mr Pistorius' actions the night he shot his girlfriend were in no way related to any anxiety issues, then the prosecution's stake-raising poker move will have done its job. But the defence vigorously opposed the move. Mr Pistorius denies intentionally killing his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp on Valentine's Day last year. He says he accidentally shot her through the toilet door in a state of panic, mistaking the 29-year-old model and law graduate for an intruder. 'No choice' The BBC's Andrew Harding in court says that Judge Thokozile Masipa's decision caught almost everyone by surprise. The trial has now been adjourned until Tuesday, when the judge will give the details behind her ruling which could mean the Olympic athlete is evaluated for a minimum of 30 days at a psychiatric faculty. Mr Pistorius's uncle, Arnold, welcomed the judge's \\"thorough\\" ruling and said it gave the family \\"confidence\\" in the justice system. Judge Masipa said that the criminal code stipulates that if an accused person is alleged not to be criminally responsible or is alleged to be mentally ill, he should be evaluated. She said that such an evaluation would ensure that Mr Pistorius would get a fair trial, adding it would be \\"preferable\\" for him to undergo the evaluation as an outpatient. Prosecution lawyer Gerrie Nel made the referral application on Tuesday after forensic psychiatrist Merryll Vorster said earlier that the double amputee was suffering from generalised anxiety disorder (Gad). Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Arnold Pistorius: \\"As a family we are comforted by the thoroughness and detail of this judgement\\" Mr Nel said that the disorder diagnosis left him with no choice but to apply for an evaluation because the condition might have affected Mr Pistorius' behaviour on the night he killed Ms Steenkamp. Legal experts say that the case may well hinge on the judge's understanding of the athlete's state of mind when he pulled the trigger.

There are no juries at trials in South Africa, so the athlete's fate will ultimately be decided by the judge, assisted by two assessors. If found guilty of murder, Mr Pistorius could face life imprisonment. If he is acquitted of that charge, the court will consider an alternative charge of culpable homicide, for which he could receive about 15 years in prison. ||||| PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) — Oscar Pistorius was ordered by a judge on Wednesday to undergo psychiatric tests, meaning that the double-amputee athlete's murder trial will be interrupted, possibly for two months Oscar Pistorius stands in the dock at the high court in Pretoria, South Africa, Wednesday, May 14, 2014.

(Associated Press) Oscar Pistorius sits in the dock in court in Pretoria, South Africa, Wednesday, May 14, 2014, as the judge overseeing his murder trial ordered him to undergo psychiatric tests, meaning that the trial... (Associated Press) The decision by Judge Thokozile Masipa followed a request for a psychiatric evaluation by the chief prosecutor, Gerrie Nel. The prosecutor had said he had no option but to ask for it after an expert witness for the defense testified that Pistorius had an anxiety disorder since childhood that may have influenced his judgment when he fatally shot his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp. Masipa said the court would reconvene on Tuesday to decide on details regarding Pistorius' period of observation. The world-famous runner stood with his hands clasped in front of him in court as the judge explained her decision. He could be acquitted if it's found that he was not criminally responsible for Steenkamp's shooting because of a mental illness. A mental disorder could also be used by his defense for a lighter sentence if he is convicted of killing Steenkamp. Legal analysts say the prosecution is in a strong position in the trial. Pistorius will likely now be evaluated by a panel of psychiatrists for a period of 30 days at a government facility, although Masipa said it would be preferable that he be an outpatient and return home each day after tests. The Olympian is free on bail after being charged with premeditated murder for Steenkamp's shooting death last year. In a statement read on behalf of his family, Pistorius' uncle, Arnold Pistorius, said the ruling reaffirmed their confidence in the South African justice system. \\"As a family, we are comforted by the thoroughness and detail of this judgment and Judge Masipa's commitment, using every avenue, to ensure a fair trial,\\" Arnold Pistorius said. In sending Pistorius, 27, for evaluation by experts, Masipa said the court was \\"ill-equipped\\" to properly assess the diagnosis by psychiatrist Dr. Merryll Vorster. The judge said it was important to assess his state of mind because of questions raised by the prosecution that Pistorius might argue he was not criminally responsible for the shooting because of his anxiety disorder. \\"The accused may not have raised the issue that he was not criminally responsible at the time of the incident in so many words, but evidence led on his behalf clearly raised the issue and cannot be ignored,\\" the judge said. Pistorius says he shot Steenkamp by mistake in the pre-dawn hours of Feb. 14, 2013, thinking there was an intruder in his home. His defense has regularly pointed to his fear of violent crime as central to his case of a mistaken killing. Vorster, the psychiatrist testifying in Pistorius' defense, said he had generalized anxiety disorder and was \\"hyper-vigilant\\" and constantly feared being attacked. The prosecution says Pistorius killed Steenkamp intentionally after an argument and prosecutor Nel said he didn't believe that an anxiety disorder played any role. But he said he had no option but to make the application on the basis of Vorster's diagnosis. In asking for the evaluation, Nel also may be pre-empting any appeal by Pistorius' defense, citing a psychiatric disorder, should he be convicted. The chief prosecutor had previously referred to a period of 30 days for a psychiatric evaluation, the typical period for observation under South African law. Any panel of experts that assesses Pistorius would take additional time to compile a report and submit it to the court. Legal analysts say the psychiatrists' report could take another month, raising the possibility of a two-month delay in the trial, which started March 3 and is in its eighth week of proceedings. Masipa noted that having Pistorius evaluated as an outpatient would be preferable as the referral was not meant to punish him. She acknowledged that there would be a significant delay. \\"This is not about anyone's convenience, but rather about whether justice has been served,\\" Masipa said, adding that she would provide details about her decision in court on Tuesday. Marius du Toit, a defense lawyer not involved in the case but following it closely, said a panel of three psychiatrists would provide the court with a report on Pistorius, and it may also deal with if he is fit to stand trial at all. ___ Imray reported from Stellenbosch, South Africa. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"Oscar Pistorius, the South African Paralympic athlete, has been ordered to undergo a month-long mental evaluation by the judge presiding over his trial.

The","completion":"individual had consumed a variety of street foods from different vendors without considering the hygiene and freshness of the ingredients. This decision to indulge in potentially contaminated dishes, unfortunately, led to a constant, uncomfortable sensation in their gut. The stomach pain was likely caused by gastroenteritis, a condition resulting from an infection of the gastrointestinal tract. Factors such as bacterial or viral agents, parasites, or an upset in the balance of gut bacteria could be responsible for this ailment. Throughout the day, the individual attempted to alleviate their discomfort using various home remedies and over-the-counter medications. However, their efforts met with limited success, as the pain persisted, becoming increasingly bothersome and affecting productivity in both personal and professional areas of their life. In addition to stomach pain, the person experienced several other distressing symptoms, such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and fever. They recognized that the severity and duration of these symptoms were not only causing tremendous discomfort but also compromising their overall well-being. Although they had initially dismissed the idea of seeking medical attention, the consistency of their agony ultimately left them with no other choice. Upon visiting a healthcare professional, they were asked to provide details about the events leading up to the development of their symptoms. The doctor paid particular attention to the types of street food consumed and whether any meals were prepared under questionable conditions. After gathering sufficient information, the doctor ordered laboratory tests, including blood work and a stool sample, to better understand the cause of the stomach ache and related symptoms. Meanwhile, the individual was advised to stay hydrated by drinking water and oral rehydration solutions, and to eat a bland diet consisting of easy-to-digest foods such as bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast. They were also prescribed anti-nausea medication and antidiarrheal drugs to lessen the severity of their symptoms. As the test results came back, it was confirmed that the person's stomach ache was indeed caused by consuming contaminated street food, which introduced harmful bacteria and toxins within their body. Consequently, an appropriate treatment plan was designed. The doctor prescribed an antibiotic regimen to target bacteria and advised the individual to continue with the dietary recommendations and pain relief medications to help manage symptoms. Furthermore, the individual was educated on the importance of food safety and hygiene, and urged to be more cautious in the future when consuming any food outside of their own kitchen. To minimize the risk of another episode, they would need to prioritize cleanliness, ensure proper food storage practices, and avoid consuming food from unknown sources. In conclusion, the stomach ache that plagued the person throughout the day was a consequence of the poor quality of food ingested, emphasizing the need for vigilance and care when selecting meals. By adopting a more mindful approach in their future food choices, the individual can take steps toward experiencing healthier, happier, and pain-free days."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I've experienced both.\\" Fearing he wouldn't make it home, he placed the note -- dated June 11, 1998 -- in a wine bottle and covered the bottle. \\"I included my geographical coordinates, so if anything happened to me, they'd know my last place when I threw the bottle into the ocean,\\" says Peter, who was then sailing from the Azores in Portugal to New York and knew the Atlantic could be dangerous.

Title: Citizen Kane Movie plot: It's 1941, and newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles, who also directed and co-wrote the script) is dead. The opening shots show Xanadu, Kane's vast, elaborate, and now unkempt estate in Florida. Interspersed with segments of his newsreel obituary are scenes from his life and death. Most puzzling are his last moments: clutching a snowglobe, he mutters the word \\"rosebud.\\" Kane, whose life was news and whose newspapers not only reported but formed public opinion, was central to his time, a larger-than-life figure. The newsreel editor feels that until they know who or what Rosebud is they won't have the whole story on Kane. He assigns a reporter called Thompson (William Alland) to investigate Rosebud.Thompson digs into Kane's life and hears a lot of stories, but none of them reveal the meaning of Rosebud. The reporter sees Susan Alexander Kane (Dorothy Comingore), the tycoon's ex-wife; she's drunk and won't speak to him. Then he reads the unpublished memoirs of Mr. Thatcher (George Coulouris), Kane's early financial adviser and childhood guardian, who later became a prime target of the Kane newspapers' trust-busting attacks. In one of many flashbacks, the Thatcher memoir shows Kane's mother signing guardianship of the boy and his fortune over to Thatcher, despite his father's objections. When Charles objected violently to being sent away with Thatcher, Kane Sr. remarked, \\"what the kid needs is a good thrashing.\\" Mrs. Kane responded, \\"That's why he's going to be brought up where you can't get at him.\\" (Some present-day fans of the film interpret this to mean that Mr. Kane was abusive. 1940s audiences were more likely to have believed that Mrs. Kane was over-protective and that if Charles had been allowed to grow up enjoying the love and discipline of his parents, his life would have turned out better.)Years later, as he was about to get control of his business affairs, Kane's interest in newspapers was piqued when he noticed that he owned the struggling New York Daily Inquirer.

The people on the ship consist of Englehorn the captain and his crew, including Hayes, a World War One veteran, Lumpy the cook, Choy the janitor, and the Venture's lookout Jimmy.

Reid Cherlin has written an article for The New Republic criticizing the overly structured way that Michelle Obama's team handles her schedule and even the way the First Lady herself deals with her staff. He said that in addition to the internal politics that comes with a group of eager staffers trying to curry favor with Mrs Obama, a good deal of the drama comes as a result of 'the exacting but often ambivalent leadership style of the first lady herself'. Scroll down for video. Speaking out: A former White House staffer has written an article slamming the inefficiencies in Michelle Obama's office, citing her need for plans for events months in advance which is described as an 'unheard of' rigidity. Staffers complained about mixed. signals, and how the lack of a clear chain of command leads to empty. voids resulting in a mess of too many people focusing on the minute. details of projects while other larger-picture goals get left by the. wayside. 'There’s no. barometer: The first lady having the wrong pencil skirt on Monday is. just as big of a f***-up as someone speaking on the record when they. didn’t mean to or a policy initiative that completely failed,' one. anonymous former aide said. Cherlin first started his career with the Obamas during the President's first campaign in 2008 and then once he was elected, Cherlin went on to work as an assistant press secretary. He came into the spotlight with the launch of the Affordable Care Act but told Politico that he felt 'pretty burnt out' and has now left to work as a reporter. In his latest piece for The New Republic, the 32-year-old zones in on the East Wing, where Michelle Obama's initiatives are so intricately planned and plotted- in his view, to their own detriment. 'Unlike her husband, who derives visible satisfaction from his ability to improvise, Mrs. Obama depends on structure to support her public warmth—the ease with which she’ll pick up a hula-hoop, say, or do the Dougie with school kids,' he writes. '(The) first lady’s office can be a confining, frustrating, even miserable place to work. Jealousy and discontentment have festered, as courtiers squabble over the allocation of responsibility and access to Mrs. Obama, both of which can be aggravatingly scarce.' As examples of the inefficiency, he cites. Let's Move launch campaigns that were met with less than overwhelming. receptions and successful initiatives like Mrs Obama's partnerships with. celebrities like Jimmy Fallon and NBA star LeBron James that were. almost waved off before they even started. Close: Reid Cherlin, seen here with the President and his former advisors Stephanie Cutter and another advisor, left the White House in 2011 and has launched a career in journalism. Former East Wing employees explained that the First Lady's nationwide popularity extends into the guarded compound at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue as well. 'They don’t want to work for her; they want to be friends with her,' the unidentified individual said. Another explained how 'every meeting was like an identity crisis' as they stressed about whether they were being invited to the daily meetings in Mrs Obama's private office. Cherlin gives examples of how Mrs Obama is seemingly aware but unmotivated by the attention from underlings, opting to place most of her trust in just a few people who have been working with she and her husband for years. 'Chief among the decision-makers are (White House chef Sam) Kass and (advisor Valerie) Jarrett—old family friends who enjoy rare access to the president and first lady’s ultra-secluded living quarters, and to Mrs. Obama’s private thinking,' Cherlin writes. That dependence on longer-term staffers to stick around because of their connection with Mrs Obama has led to some territorial infighting issues as well. He cites the June departure of Kristina Schake, the First Lady's former communications director who thought up the celebrity partnerships that proved so successful. When the West Wing got word of the positive effect of Ms Schake's initiative, President Obama's staffers began to approach her about possibly transferring to their side of the building. Careful planning: Mrs Obama's team has had some less-than-stellar public launches for some of her Let's Move initiatives, and some criticize her for being overly cautious (seen on Tuesday during her trip to China) When rumors about her possible. 'promotion' hit the East Wing water coolers, people were reportedly not. supportive of the step up but immediately skeptical, questioning whether. or not Ms Schake had asked the First Lady's permission to be perusing. other options. In the end, she left politics altogether and now works as the head of communications at L'Oreal. The. article describes how parts of Mrs Obama's personality conflict with. the way that the office is run: while she is known to be very. detail-oriented and demanding when it comes to having every aspect of. her public appearances planned, the same level of scrutiny does not. extend to the way that the East Wing is run. One. former aide described the mentality in the office as being one of 'how. can we be the caliber that we’re expected to be with no attention and no. resources and being an afterthought?' For their part, the East Wing issued a statement saying that the First Lady has been pleased with her successes in the areas of military family support and improved nutrition, even though they used a now-discredited statistic about a drop in obesity rates to justify her work. 'The First Lady is laser-focused on moving the needle wherever and whenever possible,' the statement reads.

They couldn't quite find the consistency of previous seasons and finished the year in sixth place with a 14-8 record. They played Port Adelaide in their Elimination Final at the MCG and slumped to a shock 24-point loss, which caused Buckley to call into question the club's culture.

The triangular elements of the dome are structurally rigid and distribute the structural stress throughout the structure, making geodesic domes able to withstand very heavy loads for their size. The first dome that could be called \\"geodesic\\" in every respect was designed after World War I by Walther Bauersfeld, chief engineer of the Carl Zeiss optical company, for a planetarium to house his planetarium projector.

A larger dome, called \\"The Wonder of Jena\\", opened to the public in July 1926. Some 20 years later, R. Buckminster Fuller named the dome \\"geodesic\\" from field experiments with artist Kenneth Snelson at Black Mountain College in 1948 and 1949.

The geodesic dome appealed to Fuller because it was extremely strong for its weight, its \\"omnitriangulated\\" surface provided an inherently stable structure, and because a sphere encloses the greatest volume for the least surface area. Now, provide a numbered list of answers to these questions: 1. Who made the first geodesic dome? 2. When? 3. What company did Bauersfeld work for? 4. What did he build the dome for? 5.

Article:The show, a collaboration between the late musician and Enda Walsh, is based on the story of The Man Who Fell to Earth. Bowie played the alien visitor in a 1976 film of the same name. The Times described Lazarus as \\"pretentious rubbish\\" and \\"nonsense on stilts\\". And Telegraph critic Dominic Cavendish admitted to being \\"disappointed\\". Directed by Ivo van Hove, the show features around 20 Bowie songs - old and new - and tells the story of the humanoid alien Thomas Jerome Newton and his attempts to return to his home planet while being haunted by memories of an old lover. Lazarus had its world premiere in New York almost a year ago, where Bowie made his last public appearance before his death in January. It has now relocated to London's King's Cross Theatre, a large pop-up venue next to the train station. Cavendish said of the opaque plot: \\"It's hard to engage head or heart when there's so much enigma.\\" But he added that hearing some of Bowie's classics, played by an on-stage band, \\"causes a mist of emotion-steeped reverie to descend. For some, that'll be enough\\". Ann Treneman was less generous in The Times, saying \\"its aim is to obscure and mystify, as if we are watching underwater\\" and that it is \\"like an interminable music video from the Nineties\\" - her solitary star, she writes, is for the musicians and actors. Lazarus only fares slightly better in the Evening Standard, with Henry Hitchings musing that \\"perhaps the most devoted Bowie fans will find layers of meaning here that blow their minds\\", but that in his opinion \\"this isn't a mesmerising experience and it mostly feels disappointingly earthbound\\". He gave it two stars. In the Guardian, Michael Billington struggled to find a word for the genre, settling on \\"part sci-fi story, part rock concert, part video installation, part study in alienation\\". But while he admired Michael C Hall - star of Dexter - in the central role, he admitted Lazarus did not move him and that he \\"felt a sense of alienation\\" from the whole production. Nick Wells in the Radio Times awarded five stars, saying \\"you can't help but be intrigued by the fascinating performances and underlying context\\". He said the reworked songs, including classics Changes and Heroes, \\"sound great\\", adding: \\"At times dream-like in quality, you feel not everything may even be meant to be understood. But in a way, it doesn't really matter. The overall effect is captivating, tense, and emotional.\\" Ian Shuttleworth, writing in the Financial Times, gave four stars, and said \\"a proper Bowie musical was never going to be succinctly explicable\\", writing: \\"Put it this way: Grease it ain't. The Bowie dimension explains and grounds much of this head-spinning evening.\\" Whatonstage.com also awarded four stars, with Sarah Crompton writing: \\"This is a show full of wild energy, magical effects and overwhelming music. Its themes are pertinent and potentially deeply moving. \\"But what it lacks is any real narrative arc; there's a concept where its heart ought to be, an emptiness that all its outstanding qualities cannot hide.\\" In another four-star review, The Stage's Mark Shenton said that while he did not always know what was going on, the show \\"in which a man contemplates shaking off his life on earth, is a kind of eerie premonition, a settling of Bowie's own existential reckoning\\". Quentin Letts' verdict, in the Daily Mail, was that Lazarus was \\"evocative in a slightly batty way, but without those songs and the Bowie brand it might have struggled to find a producer\\". Lazarus is at King's Cross Theatre, London, until 22 January 2017.

Input: Abstract: It has been postulated that increased energy expenditure results in shortened survival. To test this \\"rate-of-living theory\\" we examined the effect of raising energy expenditure by means of cold exposure on the longevity of rats. Male 6-mo-old SPF Long-Evans rats were gradually accustomed to immersion in cool water (23 degrees C). After 3 mo they were standing in the cool water for 4 h/day, 5 days/wk. They were maintained on this program until age 32 mo. The cold exposure resulted in a 44% increase in food intake (P less than 0.001). Despite their greater food intake, the cold-exposed rats' body weights were significantly lower than those of control animals from age 11 to 32 mo. The average age at death of the cold-exposed rats was 968 +/- 141 days compared with 923 +/- 159 days for the controls. The cold exposure appeared to protect against neoplasia, particularly sarcomas; only 24% of the necropsied cold-exposed rats had malignancies compared with 57% for the controls.

Despite receiving mixed reviews from critics for her acting prowess, she has established herself in Bollywood, and is considered among the country's most attractive and highest-paid actresses. Born in Hong Kong, Kaif and her family lived in several countries before she moved to London. She received her first modelling assignment as a teenager and later pursued a career as a fashion model. Katrina Kaif was born in Hong Kong with her mother's surname Turquotte (also spelt Turcotte), on 16 July 1983. According to the actress, her father (Mohammed Kaif) is a British businessman of Kashmiri Indian descent and her mother (Suzanne, also spelt Susanna) is an English lawyer and charity worker. She has seven siblings: three elder sisters (Stephanie, Christine, and Natasha), three younger sisters (Melissa, Sonia, and Isabel) and an elder brother, Michael. Isabelle Kaif is also a model and actress. Kaif's parents divorced when she was a child, and her father moved to the United States. She said her father had no influence on Kaif or her siblings while they were growing up, and they were raised by their mother. On her father's absence in her life, Kaif stated: \\"When I see friends who have wonderful fathers who are like pillars of support for their families, I say, if only I had that. But instead of complaining, I should be grateful for all the other things I have\\". In a 2009 interview with The Indian Express, she said she was not in touch with her father. Kaif says that her mother decided to \\"dedicate her life to social causes\\", which led to the family's relocation to a number of countries for varying lengths of time: Our transitions in growing up were--from Hong Kong where I was born, to China, then to Japan, and from Japan by boat to France ... After France, Switzerland--and I'm cutting out many East European countries where we were for only a few months each--then Poland in Krakow ... After that we went to Belgium, then to Hawaii, which was a short time, and then came to London. Due to their frequent relocation, Kaif and her siblings were home-schooled by a series of tutors. Although she is thought to have grown up in London, she lived there for only three years before moving to India. According to Kaif, she then changed her surname to her father's because she thought it would be easier to pronounce. Kaif's paternal parentage has been questioned by some members of the film industry. In a 2011 interview with Mumbai Mirror, Boom producer Ayesha Shroff accused Kaif of fabricating her history: \\"We created an identity for her. She was this pretty young English girl, and we gave her the Kashmiri father and thought of calling her Katrina Kazi. We thought we'd give her some kind of Indian ancestry, to connect with the audience ... But then we thought that Kazi sounded too ... religious? ... Mohammad Kaif was at the top, and so we said, Katrina Kaif sounds really great\\". Kaif called Shroff's comments \\"hurtful\\".

Answer:","completion":"Angela Davis is famous primarily for her work as a political activist, academic, and author. She has been a prominent figure in American civil rights movements, advocating for social justice, race and gender equality, and prison reform. Several factors and events have contributed to her fame: 1. Membership in the Communist Party USA: Angela Davis joined the Communist Party USA in the 1960s and became a leading member. Her association with the party established her as an influential voice for race and class struggle in the context of Marxist principles. 2. Role in the Black Panther Party: While not an official member, Davis interacted with and supported the Black Panther Party, a radical African-American political organization that aimed to challenge racial inequality and oppression. 3. Involvement in the Soledad Brothers case: In 1970, Angela Davis became involved in the case of the Soledad Brothers, three African-American inmates accused of killing a prison guard at Soledad Prison in California. Davis was charged with murder, kidnapping, and conspiracy for her alleged involvement in an attempt to free the Soledad Brothers from prison, which resulted in the death of a judge and several hostages. She was added to the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List, leading to a high-profile international campaign to find and arrest her. 4. Imprisonment and trial: After spending 16 months in jail, Davis was tried in a widely followed trial, prompting global protests demanding her release. She was ultimately acquitted of all charges in 1972. 5. Academic career and philosophy: Davis holds a Ph.D. in philosophy and has been a professor at several prestigious institutions, including the University of California, San Francisco State University, and Syracuse University. Her academic work focuses on critical theory, African American studies, and feminist philosophy, and she has written numerous books and articles on these subjects. 6. Women's rights activism: Angela Davis is an outspoken advocate for women's rights and has addressed issues such as reproductive rights, intersectionality, and violence against women. She has played a critical role in the development of intersectional feminism, which recognizes the overlapping nature of various forms of oppression. 7. Prison reform and abolition: Davis is a prominent critic of the American prison system and has advocated for radical reforms, including the abolition of prisons. She co-founded Critical Resistance, an organization that works to dismantle the prison-industrial complex and build alternatives based on rehabilitation and social justice. In summary, Angela Davis became famous due to her political activism, involvement with prominent social and political movements, her academic career, and advocacy for social justice, which includes opposition to racial and gender inequalities and advocating for prison reform."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which city had fewer people exposed to chemical particles released into the air by human actions? Hint: Recall that air pollution is due to chemical substances and particles released into the air mainly by human actions. When most people think of air pollution, they think of the pollution outdoors. But it is just as easy to have indoor air pollution. Your home or school classroom probably doesn't get much fresh air. Sealing up your home reduces heating and cooling costs. But this also causes air pollution to stay trapped indoors. And people today usually spend a majority of their time indoors. So exposure to indoor air pollution can become a significant health risk. A:","completion":"Based on the information provided, Pine city had fewer people exposed to chemical particles released into the air by human actions. Twin city was facing increased air pollution, which led to their residents experiencing various respiratory diseases. This indicates that there were higher levels of chemical substances and particles in the air, which are mainly released by human actions. On the other hand, Pine city had problems with age-related diseases, but there was no mention of air pollution or respiratory issues in this city. Considering that air pollution is the result of chemical substances and particles in the air, primarily caused by human activities, Pine city was likely to have experienced fewer of these harmful substances in the air. Furthermore, the hint provided emphasizes that indoor air pollution can also be a significant health risk, as sealing up homes and buildings can trap harmful pollutants inside, resulting in poor air quality. Both outdoor and indoor air pollution can adversely affect human health.

Several factors could have contributed to this victory, including strong performances from Boston's key players, sound tactical decisions from the coaching staff, and the team's deep-rooted competitive spirit. When two teams face each other in a game of high tension and pressure, it often comes down to which side can handle that pressure better, capitalize on the opposition's weaknesses or mistakes, and dominate the game's pivotal moments. In this particular game, the Boston Red Sox emerged as the triumphant team, demonstrating their unwavering resilience and ability to overcome challenges. On the flip side, the Baltimore Orioles' loss may serve as a learning opportunity for the team, highlighting the need for improvement and growth, whether it be in terms of player performance, strategizing by the coaching staff, or overall team dynamics. In conclusion, the Boston Red Sox managed to successfully dismantle the Baltimore Orioles' aspirations of a four-game sweep and a .500 record with an impressive 8-3 win. Baseball, being a sport defined by its riveting and unpredictable nature, showcases the indomitable spirit of competition wherein every game matters and impacts the season. The Orioles may have missed their opportunity this time, but they will likely use this setback as a stepping stone for future successes. Similarly, the Red Sox would relish this victory and use it as momentum to keep pushing their limits and striving for continued success throughout the season."},{"prompt":"Teacher:In this task, you are given a pair of action statements.

A second set of emissaries were sent in 1268, returning empty-handed like the first. Both sets of emissaries met with the Chinzei Bugyō, or Defense Commissioner for the West, who passed on the message to Shikken, Hōjō Tokimune, Japan's ruler in Kamakura and to the Emperor of Japan in Kyoto. After discussing the letters with his inner circle, there was much debate, but the Shikken had his mind made up; he had the emissaries sent back with no answer. The Mongols continued to send demands, some through Korean emissaries and some through Mongol ambassadors on March 7, 1269; September 17, 1269; September 1271; and May 1272. However, each time, the bearers were not permitted to land in Kyushu. The Imperial Court suggested compromise, but really had little effect in the matter, due to political marginalization after the Jōkyū War. The uncompromising shogunate ordered all those who held fiefs in Kyūshū, the area closest to the Korean Peninsula and thus most likely to be attacked, to return to their lands and forces in Kyūshū moved west, further securing the most likely landing points.

However, the overall cooling of lava is not only dependent on the air temperature but also on other factors such as the lava's chemical composition, thickness, and surrounding environment. In this situation, if freezing rain cools down the air, the lava might cool at a slightly faster rate due to the lowered ambient temperature (Option A: more). However, it is important to note that the heat generated by the lava itself would still be the dominant factor in the cooling process, and the effect of freezing rain would likely be minimal in comparison. Additionally, since lava is significantly hotter than freezing rain temperatures, the interaction between the two could result in the freezing rain evaporating or turning into steam upon contact, limiting the actual cooling impact on the lava."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person whose colleagues demand be declared insane? from the following article ? Theodore Honey, an eccentric \\"boffin\\" with the Royal Aircraft Establishment, is working on solving a difficult aviation crash problem. A widower with a 12-year-old daughter, Elspeth, Honey is sent from Farnborough to investigate the crash of a Rutland Reindeer airliner in Labrador, Canada. He theorizes the accident happened because of the tailplane's structural failure, caused by sudden metal fatigue after 1440 flight hours. To test the theory in his laboratory, a rear airframe is being vibrated at a very high rate in daily eight-hour cycles. It is not until Honey finds himself on board a Reindeer airliner that he realizes he is flying on an early production aircraft that is close to the number of hours his theory projects for the metal fatigue failure. Despite the fact that his theory is not yet proven, he decides to warn the aircrew and Hollywood actress Monica Teasdale, a fellow passenger. After the Reindeer safely lands at Gander Airport in Newfoundland, an inspection clears the aircraft to continue on its route. Honey then takes drastic action to stop the flight by activating the Reindeer's undercarriage lever, dropping the airliner on its belly and seriously damaging it. Shocked by the act, some of his colleagues demand that he be declared insane to discredit his unproved theory and save the reputation of British passenger aviation now awash in a sea of bad press. Teasdale and an airline stewardess Marjorie Corder both take a liking to Mr. Honey and Elspeth, who they discover is lonely and isolated from her schoolmates. Teasdale speaks to Honey's superiors on his behalf, claiming she believes in him. Corder, meanwhile, has stayed on with Honey and his daughter as a nurse.

Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: How many members are on the council of the district that has laws that can be overturned by Congress? Washington, D.C., formally the District of Columbia and commonly referred to as Washington or D.C., is the capital of the United States. Founded after the American Revolution as the seat of government of the newly independent country, Washington was named after George Washington, the first President of the United States and a Founding Father. As the seat of the United States federal government and several international organizations, Washington is an important world political capital. The city is also one of the most visited cities in the world, with more than 20 million tourists annually.The signing of the Residence Act on July 16, 1790, approved the creation of a capital district located along the Potomac River on the country's East Coast. The U.S. Constitution provided for a federal district under the exclusive jurisdiction of the U.S. Congress, and the District is therefore not a part of any state. The states of Maryland and Virginia each donated land to form the federal district, which included the pre-existing settlements of Georgetown and Alexandria. The City of Washington was founded in 1791 to serve as the new national capital. In 1846, Congress returned the land originally ceded by Virginia; in 1871, it created a single municipal government for the remaining portion of the District. Washington had an estimated population of 702,455 as of July 2018, making it the 20th most populous city in the United States. Commuters from the surrounding Maryland and Virginia suburbs raise the city's daytime population to more than one million during the workweek. Washington's metropolitan area, the country's sixth largest, had a 2017 estimated population of 6.2 million residents.All three branches of the U.S. federal government are centered in the District: Congress (legislative), president (executive), and the U.S. Supreme Court (judicial). Washington is home to many national monuments, and museums, primarily situated on or around the National Mall. The city hosts 177 foreign embassies as well as the headquarters...

The story begins with Thet getting involved in journalism after his entire family was killed during the brutal regime. He is determined to uncover the truth about the atrocities committed in his country during the late 1970s. Thet becomes a prominent journalist in Phnom Penh utilizing his connections and sharp investigative skills. He starts receiving anonymous tips about the locations of former Khmer Rouge officials who played a significant role in the genocide. Driven by his passion for truth and desire to bring justice for the millions of innocent lives lost, Thet decides to visit these people and record their confessions. As Thet travels through rural Cambodia with an old cassette recorder and a list of names, he encounters several former Khmer Rouge members who are now living simple lives as farmers or laborers. Some of them are hesitant to share their stories, while others openly admit their responsibility for the mass killings. The encounters with these individuals trigger flashbacks of Thet's own terrifying experiences, including the loss of his family. One of the central figures Thet seeks out is Nuon Chea, who was Pol Pot's second in command and known as \\"Brother Number Two\\". Thet forms a complex relationship with Nuon Chea, who both denies responsibility and displays occasional moments of genuine remorse. Over time, Thet gains Nuon's trust, and he reveals shocking information about the inner workings of the Khmer Rouge and the true motivations behind the genocide. As the world prepares for the new millennium, Thet's work becomes increasingly dangerous as he uncovers a conspiracy to protect some of the highest-ranking Khmer Rouge officials still alive. He decides to expose these individuals and bring their hidden past to light in hopes of finding closure for himself and the millions of Cambodians who suffered unimaginable pain. As the clock ticks closer to the year 2000, Thet becomes a target for those trying to suppress the truth. His journalism work starts facing censorship, and threats are made against his life. The movie's climax depicts a thrilling sequence where Thet races against time to publish his findings and record the confessions of the most notable Khmer Rouge officials as evidence against them. In the end, Thet is successful in his pursuit of justice. His efforts reveal the truth behind Cambodia's darkest days and contribute to the eventual trial of some of the most notorious Khmer Rouge leaders.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance. - Carnivora (from Latin \\"car\\" (stem \\"carn-\\") \\"flesh\\" and \\"vorre\\" \\"to devour\\") is a diverse order that includes over 280 species of placental mammals. Its members are formally referred to as carnivorans, whereas the word \\"carnivore\\" (often popularly applied to members of this group) can refer to any meat-eating organism. Carnivorans are the most diverse in size of any mammalian order, ranging from the least weasel (\\"Mustela nivalis\\"), at as little as and , to the polar bear (\\"Ursus maritimus\\"), which can weigh up to , to the southern elephant seal (\\"Mirounga leonina\\"), whose adult males weigh up to and measure up to in length. - Rats are various medium-sized, long-tailed rodents of the superfamily Muroidea. \\"True rats\\" are members of the genus \\"Rattus\\", the most important of which to humans are the black rat, \\"Rattus rattus\\", and the brown rat, \\"Rattus norvegicus\\". Many members of other rodent genera and families are also referred to as rats, and share many characteristics with true rats. - Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria. - Reptiles are tetrapod (four-limbed vertebrate) animals in the class Reptilia, comprising today's turtles, crocodilians, snakes, amphisbaenians, lizards, tuatara, and their extinct relatives. The study of these traditional reptile orders, historically combined with that of modern amphibians, is called herpetology. - Guatemala (, or ), officially the Republic of Guatemala, is a country in Central America bordered by Mexico to the north and west, the Pacific Ocean to the southwest, Belize to the northeast, the Caribbean to the east, Honduras to the east and El Salvador to the southeast. With an estimated population of around 15.8 million, it is the most populated state in Central America. A representative democracy, Guatemala's capital and largest city is Nueva Guatemala de la Asunción, also known as Guatemala City. - Omnivore is a consumption classification for animals that have the capability to obtain chemical energy and nutrients from materials originating from plant and animal origin. Often, omnivores also have the ability to incorporate food sources such as algae, fungi, and bacteria into their diet as well. - Central America is the southernmost, isthmian portion of the North American continent, which connects with South America on the southeast. Central America is bordered by Mexico to the north, Colombia to the southeast, the Caribbean Sea to the east, and the Pacific Ocean to the west. Central America consists of seven countries: Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama. The combined population of Central America is between 41,739,000 (2009 estimate) and 42,688,190 (2012 estimate). - An endotherm (from Greek \\"endon\\" \\"within\\" and \\"therm\\" \\"heat\\") is an organism that maintains its body at a metabolically favorable temperature, largely by the use of heat set free by its internal bodily functions instead of relying almost purely on ambient heat. Such internally generated heat is mainly an incidental product of the animal's routine metabolism, but under conditions of excessive cold or low activity an endotherm might apply special mechanisms adapted specifically to heat production. Examples include special-function muscular exertion such as shivering, and uncoupled oxidative metabolism such as within brown adipose tissue. Only birds and mammals are extant universally endothermic groups of animals. Certain lamnid sharks, tuna and billfishes are also endothermic. - Theria (Greek: \\"\\", wild beast) is a subclass of mammals amongst the Theriiformes (the sister taxa to Yinotheria). Theria includes the eutherians (including the placental mammals) and the metatherians (including the marsupials). - A mammary gland is an exocrine gland in mammals that produces milk to feed young offspring. Mammals get their name from the word \\"mammary\\". The mammary glands are arranged in organs such as the breasts in primates (for example, humans and chimpanzees), the udder in ruminants (for example, cows, goats, and deer), and the dugs of other animals (for example, dogs and cats). Lactorrhea, the occasional production of milk by the glands, can occur in any mammal, but in most mammals lactation, the production of enough milk for nursing, occurs only in phenotypic females who have gestated in recent months or years. It is directed by hormonal guidance from sex steroids. In a few mammalian species, male lactation can occur. - Synapsids (Greek, 'fused arch'), synonymous with theropsids (Greek, 'beast-face'), are a group of animals that includes mammals and every animal more closely related to mammals than to other living amniotes. They are easily separated from other amniotes by having a temporal fenestra, an opening low in the skull roof behind each eye, leaving a bony arch beneath each; this accounts for their name. Primitive synapsids are usually called pelycosaurs or pelycosaur-grade synapsids; more advanced mammal-like ones, therapsids. The non-mammalian members are described as mammal-like reptiles in classical systematics; they can also be called stem mammals or proto-mammals. Synapsids evolved from basal amniotes and are one of the two major groups of the later amniotes; the other is the sauropsids, a group that includes modern reptiles and birds. The distinctive temporal fenestra developed in the ancestral synapsid about 312 million years ago, during the Late Carboniferous period. - Panama City is the capital and largest city of the Republic of Panama. It has an urban population of 430,299, and its population totals 880,691 when rural areas are included. The city is located at the Pacific entrance of the Panama Canal, in the province of Panama. The city is the political and administrative center of the country, as well as a hub for international banking and commerce. It is considered a \\"gamma+\\" world city, one of three Central American cities listed in this category. - Sauropsida (\\"lizard faces\\") is a group of amniotes that includes all existing birds and reptiles as well as their fossil ancestors and other extinct relatives. Large land animals are either in this group or in its sister group, Synapsida, which includes mammals and their fossil relatives. This clade includes Parareptilia and other extinct clades. All living sauropsids are members of the sub-group Diapsida, the Parareptilia clade having died out 200 million years ago. The term originated in 1864 with Thomas Henry Huxley, who grouped birds with reptiles based on fossil evidence. - Mexico (, modern Nahuatl ), officially the United Mexican States, is a federal republic in the southern half of North America. It is bordered to the north by the United States; to the south and west by the Pacific Ocean; to the southeast by Guatemala, Belize, and the Caribbean Sea; and to the east by the Gulf of Mexico. Covering almost two million square kilometers (over 760,000 sq mi), Mexico is the sixth largest country in the Americas by total area and the 13th largest independent nation in the world. With an estimated population of over 120 million, it is the eleventh most populous country and the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world while being the second most populous country in Latin America. Mexico is a federation comprising 31 states and a federal district that is also its capital and most populous city. Other metropolises include Guadalajara, Monterrey, Puebla, Toluca, Tijuana and León. - Miacoidea is a paraphyletic superfamily that had been traditionally divided into two families of carnivores: Miacidae (the miacids) and Viverravidae. Miacoids were primitive carnivores that lived during the Paleocene and Eocene Epochs, about 33-66 million years ago. Today, Miacidae is recognized as a paraphyletic array of stem taxa that probably resulted in some \\"miacid\\" genera ending up just outside the order Carnivora, the crown-group within the Carnivoramorpha. Carnivoramorpha consists of both Miacoidea and Carnivora, but excludes the order Creodonta that existed alongside Carnivoramorpha. Miacoids are regarded as basal carnivoramorphs. The miacids are a paraphyletic group containing all miacoids that are not viverravids. - In an ecosystem, predation is a biological interaction where a predator (an organism that is hunting) feeds on its prey (the organism that is attacked). Predators may or may not kill their prey prior to feeding on them, but the act of predation often results in the death of the prey and the eventual absorption of the prey's tissue through consumption. Thus predation is often, though not always, carnivory. Other categories of consumption are herbivory (eating parts of plants), fungivory (eating parts of fungi), and detritivory (the consumption of dead organic material). All these consumption categories fall under the rubric of consumer-resource systems. It can often be difficult to separate various types of feeding behaviors. For example, some parasitic species prey on a host organism and then lay their eggs on it for their offspring to feed on it while it continues to live in or on its decaying corpse after it has died. The key characteristic of predation however is the predator's direct impact on the prey population. On the other hand, detritivores simply eat dead organic material arising from the decay of dead individuals and have no direct impact on the \\"donor\\" organism(s). - Hair is a protein filament that grows from follicles found in the dermis, or skin. Hair is one of the defining characteristics of mammals. The human body, apart from areas of glabrous skin, is covered in follicles which produce thick terminal and fine vellus hair. Most common interest in hair is focused on hair growth, hair types and hair care, but hair is also an important biomaterial primarily composed of protein, notably keratin. - Mustelodon is an extinct carnivore , which belongs to the family Viverravidae . This genus contains only one species , Mustelodon primerus . Fossils of this mammal were found in the 57 million years old deposits of Lago Nandarajo , near the northern border of Panama in Central America . Mustelodon had a length of approximately 80 cm ( head to tail ) and this carnivore superficially resembled the modern mongooses . Mustelodon fed on fruits , insects and smaller mammals like shrews . It is closely related to the more famous Protictis from the Paleocene of the United States ( Wannagan Creek - South Dakota , San Juan Basin - New Mexico ) . - A carnivore meaning 'meat eater' (Latin, \\"caro\\" meaning 'meat' or 'flesh' and \\"vorare\\" meaning 'to devour') is an organism that derives its energy and nutrient requirements from a diet consisting mainly or exclusively of animal tissue, whether through predation or scavenging. Animals that depend solely on animal flesh for their nutrient requirements are called obligate carnivores while those that also consume non-animal food are called facultative carnivores. Omnivores also consume both animal and non-animal food, and apart from the more general definition, there is no clearly defined ratio of plant to animal material that would distinguish a facultative carnivore from an omnivore. A carnivore that sits at the top of the food chain is termed an apex predator. - Costa Rica (literally meaning \\"Rich Coast\\"), officially the Republic of Costa Rica, is a country in Central America, bordered by Nicaragua to the north, Panama to the southeast, the Pacific Ocean to the west, the Caribbean Sea to the east, and Ecuador to the south of Cocos Island. It has a population of around 4.5 million, of whom nearly a quarter live in the metropolitan area of the capital and largest city, San José. - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds. - Vertebrates comprise all species of animals within the subphylum Vertebrata (chordates with backbones). Vertebrates represent the overwhelming majority of the phylum Chordata, with currently about 64,000 species described. Vertebrates include the jawless fish and the jawed vertebrates, which include the cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays) and the bony fish. - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water. - Viverravidae is an extinct family within the superfamily Miacoidea. They are related to carnivorans, and lived from the early Palaeocene to the Eocene. - Theriiformes is a subclass of mammals. The term was coined in 1997 by McKenna & Bell in their classification of mammals. - Panama, officially called the Republic of Panama, is a country usually considered to be entirely in North America or Central America. It is bordered by Costa Rica to the west, Colombia (in South America) to the southeast, the Caribbean Sea to the north and the Pacific Ocean to the south. The capital and largest city is Panama City, whose metropolitan area is home to nearly half of the country's 3.9 million people.

One assumption that we make when talking about collisions between gas particles is that they are completely elastic collisions. In an elastic collision , momentum is conserved, which means that none of the kinetic energy of the colliding particles is lost in some other form (such as the emission of light). This makes sense, because if energy were lost in collisions, the speeds of the particles would gradually decrease over time, and eventually everything would condense down into a solid form.

One day, while watching a futuristic robot movie with his best friends, Shizuka, Takeshi, and Suneo, Nobita dreams of having his own giant robot to go on thrilling adventures and explore uncharted territories. One weekend, at a local garage sale, Nobita stumbles upon an old comic book titled \\"The Giant RC Toy Robot Adventures\\" which seemingly shares the same concept of a kid controlling a giant robot. Intrigued by the comic book, he brings it home and starts reading it. Upon finishing the comic, he finds a hidden blueprint and manual inside for building the giant robot, along with a cryptic message that says, \\"Destiny awaits the one who brings me to life.\\" Overwhelmed with excitement and curiosity, Nobita takes the blueprints to school to share with his friends. Despite the initial skepticism, Shizuka, Takeshi, and Suneo become enthralled by the idea, and the group sets out to scavenge parts from various abandoned factories and junkyards around the town. With their combined technical skills and problem-solving abilities, the friends manage to gather all the necessary components and single-handedly construct the robot, which they name \\"Robodyssey.\\" Upon completion, Robodyssey comes to life, revealing an advanced AI system embedded within it. The AI system, known as \\"Cerebrotron,\\" informs the group that they have now become the chosen team of the legend. It tells them that the original creator of the blueprint and the manual belonged to a secret organization dedicated to protecting Earth from potential otherworldly threats and that the robot was designed to fulfill such missions. At first, the friends are thrilled to go on missions, as they use Robodyssey to explore unknown places, unlock hidden secrets of their world, and gain universal knowledge. However, as time goes on, they learn that they have unintentionally attracted the attention of malevolent beings from outer space, who seek to take control of Robodyssey's advanced technology and AI system to conquer Earth. Determined to protect their planet and their creation, Nobita, Shizuka, Takeshi, and Suneo must learn to work together and navigate the challenges of becoming unlikely heroes. They soon discover that teamwork, friendship, and courage are essential elements in the battle against evil forces. Along the way, they encounter allies and foes, while continuing to unravel the mystery behind the secret organization and the true purpose of Robodyssey. As the film draws to a climax, Nobita and his friends must use their collective wits and willpower to engage in a final, epic showdown with the villainous alien force. The film would conclude with a hard-won victory, as the friends prove that even ordinary individuals can make a difference when given the chance.

Galbraith was born on October 15, 1908, to Canadians of Scottish descent, Sarah Catherine (Kendall) and Archibald \\"Archie\\" Galbraith, in Iona Station, Ontario, Canada, and was raised in Dunwich Township, Ontario. He had three siblings: Alice, Catherine, and Archibald William (Bill). By the time he was a teenager, he had adopted the name Ken, and later disliked being called John. Galbraith grew to be a very tall man, attaining a height of 6 feet 9 inches (206 cm). His father was a farmer and school teacher. His mother, a homemaker and a community activist, died when he was fourteen years old. The family farm was located on Thomson Line. Both of his parents were supporters of the United Farmers of Ontario in the 1920s. His early years were spent at a one-room school which is still standing, on Willy's Side Road. Later, he went to Dutton High School and St. Thomas High School. In 1931, Galbraith graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Agriculture from the Ontario Agricultural College, which was then an associate agricultural college of the University of Toronto. He majored in animal husbandry. He was awarded a Giannini Scholarship in Agricultural Economics (receiving 60 per month) that allowed him to travel to Berkeley, California, where he received Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy degrees in agricultural economics from the University of California, Berkeley. Galbraith was taught economics by Professor George Martin Peterson, and together they wrote an economics paper titled \\"The Concept of Marginal Land\\" in 1932 that was published in the American Journal of Agricultural Economics. After graduation in 1934, he started to work as an instructor at Harvard University. Galbraith taught intermittently at Harvard in the period 1934 to 1939. From 1939 to 1940, he taught at Princeton University. In 1937, he became a citizen of the United States and was no longer a British subject. In the same year, he took a year-long fellowship at the University of Cambridge, England, where he was influenced by John Maynard Keynes. He then traveled in Europe for several months in 1938, attending an international economic conference and developing his ideas. His public service started in the era of New Deal when he joined the United States Department of Agriculture. From 1943 until 1948, he served as an editor of Fortune magazine.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Information: - Blu-ray or Blu-ray Disc (BD) is a digital optical disc data storage format. It was designed to supersede the DVD format, in that it is capable of storing high-definition (720p and 1080p) and ultra high-definition video resolution (2160p). The plastic disc is 120 mm in diameter and 1.2 mm thick, the same size as DVDs and CDs. Conventional (pre-BD-XL) Blu-ray Disc discs contain 25 GB per layer, with dual layer discs (50 GB) being the industry standard for feature-length video discs. Triple-layer discs (100 GB) and quadruple layers (128 GB) are available for \\"BD-XL\\" re-writer drives. The name \\"Blu-ray\\" refers to the blue laser (specifically, a violet laser) used to read the disc, which allows information to be stored at a greater density than is possible with the longer-wavelength red laser used for DVDs. The main application of Blu-ray is as a medium for video material such as feature films and physical distribution of video games for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. Besides the hardware specifications, Blu-ray is associated with a set of multimedia formats. - Sharon Janny den Adel (born 12 July 1974) is a Dutch singer, songwriter and fashion designer, best known as the lead vocalist and one of the main songwriters in the Dutch symphonic metal band Within Temptation. She has been a performing musician since the age of 14, and was a founding member of Within Temptation, along with Robert Westerholt, in 1996. - A DVD player is a device that plays discs produced under both the DVD-Video and DVD-Audio technical standards, two different and incompatible standards. Some DVD players will also play audio CDs. DVD players are connected to a television to watch the DVD content, which could be a movie, a recorded TV show, or other content. - , formerly known as , is a Japanese multinational electronics corporation headquartered in Kadoma, Osaka, Japan. - The guitar is a musical instrument classified as a string instrument with anywhere from four to 18 strings, usually having six. The sound is projected either acoustically, using a hollow wooden or plastic and wood box (for an acoustic guitar), or through electrical amplifier and a speaker (for an electric guitar). It is typically played by strumming or plucking the strings with the fingers, thumb and/or fingernails of the right hand or with a pick while fretting (or pressing against the frets) the strings with the fingers of the left hand. The guitar is a type of chordophone, traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, nylon or steel strings and distinguished from other chordophones by its construction and tuning. The modern guitar was preceded by the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument. - Koninklijke Philips N.V. (Royal Philips, commonly known as Philips) is a Dutch technology company headquartered in Amsterdam with primary divisions focused in the areas of electronics, healthcare and lighting. It was founded in Eindhoven in 1891, by Gerard Philips and his father Frederik. It is one of the largest electronics companies in the world and employs around 105,000 people across more than 60 countries. - Sony Corporation is the electronics business unit and the parent company of the Sony Group, which is engaged in business through its four operating components electronics (video games, network services and medical business), motion pictures, music and financial services. These make Sony one of the most comprehensive entertainment companies in the world. Sony's principal business operations include Sony Corporation, Sony Pictures Entertainment, Sony Interactive Entertainment, Sony Music Entertainment, Sony Mobile (formerly Sony Ericsson) and Sony Financial. Sony is among the Semiconductor sales leaders by year and as of 2013, the fourth-largest television manufacturer in the world, after Samsung Electronics, LG Electronics and TCL. - Gothic metal (or goth metal) is a fusion genre combining the heaviness of heavy metal with the dark atmospheres of gothic rock. The music of gothic metal is diverse with bands known to adopt the gothic approach to different styles of heavy metal music. The genre originated during the early 1990s in Europe originally as an outgrowth of death-doom, a fusion of death metal and doom metal. Lyrics are generally dark and introspective with inspiration from gothic fiction as well as personal experiences. - High-definition video is video of higher resolution and quality than standard-definition. While there is no standardized meaning for \\"high-definition\\", generally any video image with considerably more than 480 horizontal lines (North America) or 576 horizontal lines (Europe) is considered high-definition. 480 scan lines is generally the minimum even though the majority of systems greatly exceed that. Images of standard resolution captured at rates faster than normal (60 frames/second North America, 50 fps Europe), by a high-speed camera may be considered high-definition in some contexts. Some television series shot on high-definition video are made to look as if they have been shot on film, a technique which is often known as filmizing. - Black Symphony is a live album , DVD and Blu - ray Disc from Dutch symphonic metal band Within Temptation . It was released worldwide on September 22 -- 24 , 2008 and is available on 2 - disc DVD , 2 - disc CD , and Blu - ray . - Toshiba was founded in 1938 as Tokyo Shibaura Electric K.K. through the merger of Shibaura Seisaku-sho (founded in 1875) and Tokyo Denki (founded in 1890). The company name was officially changed to Toshiba Corporation in 1978. Toshiba made a large number of corporate acquisitions during its history, including of Semp in 1977, of Westinghouse Electric LLC, a nuclear energy company in 2006, of Landis+Gyr in 2011, and of IBM's point-of-sale business in 2012. - Classical music is art music produced or rooted in the traditions of Western music, including both liturgical (religious) and secular music. While a more accurate term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows: European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines, chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and \\"ad libitum\\" ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song (strophic) form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can sustain larger forms and attain a high level of complexity. - 3VOOR12 is a multimedia platform of the Netherlands Public Broadcasting VPRO for alternative pop. - Delain is a Dutch symphonic metal band formed in 2002 by former Within Temptation keyboardist Martijn Westerholt, and Charlotte Wessels. The name of the band comes from the Kingdom of Delain in Stephen King's novel, \\"The Eyes of the Dragon\\". - Doom metal is an extreme style of heavy metal music that typically uses slower tempos, low-tuned guitars and a much \\"thicker\\" or \\"heavier\\" sound than other metal genres. Both the music and the lyrics intend to evoke a sense of despair, dread, and impending doom. The genre is strongly influenced by the early work of Black Sabbath, who formed a prototype for doom metal with songs such as \\"Black Sabbath\\", \\"Children of the Grave\\", \\"Electric Funeral\\" and \\"Into the Void\\". During the first half of the 1980s, a number of bands from England (Pagan Altar, Witchfinder General), the United States (Pentagram, Saint Vitus, Trouble) and Sweden (Candlemass, Count Raven) defined doom metal as a distinct genre. - DVD (an abbreviation of \\"digital versatile disc\\" or \\"digital video disc\\") is a digital optical disc storage format invented and developed by Philips, Sony, Toshiba, and Panasonic in 1995. The medium can store any kind of digital data and is widely used for software and other computer files as well as video programs watched using DVD players. DVDs offer higher storage capacity than compact discs while having the same dimensions. - Power metal is a subgenre of heavy metal combining characteristics of traditional metal with speed metal, often within symphonic context. Generally, power metal is characterized by a more uplifting sound, instead of the heaviness and dissonance prevalent in styles such as doom metal and death metal. Power metal bands usually have anthem-like songs with fantasy-based subject matter and strong choruses, thus creating a theatrical, dramatic and emotionally \\"powerful\\" sound. The term was first used in the middle of the 1980s and refers to two different but related styles: the first pioneered and largely practiced in North America with a harder sound similar to speed metal, and a later more widespread and popular style based in Europe (especially Scandinavia, Germany, Greece and Italy), South America (especially Brazil and Argentina) and Japan, with a lighter, more melodic sound and frequent use of keyboards. - Nightwish is a symphonic power metal band from Kitee, Finland. The band was formed in 1996 by lead songwriter and keyboardist Tuomas Holopainen, guitarist Emppu Vuorinen, and lead singer Tarja Turunen. The band soon picked up drummer Jukka Nevalainen, and then bassist Sami Vänskä after the release of their debut album, \\"Angels Fall First\\" (1997). In 2002, Vänskä was replaced by Marco Hietala, who also took over the male vocalist role previously filled by Holopainen or guest singers. - Symphonic metal is a subgenre of metal music which combines the characteristics of this genre, such as heavy drums and guitars, with different elements of classical music including symphonic instruments, choirs and on occasion, a full symphony orchestra. Keyboards reminiscent of power metal also often find a dominant place in this subgenre. Symphonic metal bands often feature classically trained female vocalists, giving rise to the nickname opera metal or operatic metal, and it is not uncommon for them to feature a second vocalist performing growls, a more common characteristic of gothic metal. Perhaps the most typical and prominent examples of symphonic metal bands are Finnish band Nightwish, Dutch bands Within Temptation, Delain and Epica, and Swedish band Therion, all four of which place a large focus on elements prevalent in film scores on top of the more basic classical components utilized more widely in the genre. - The PlayStation 3 (abbreviated as PS3) is a home video game console developed by Sony Computer Entertainment. It is the successor to PlayStation 2, and is part of the PlayStation brand of consoles. It competed with Microsoft's Xbox 360 and Nintendo's Wii as part of the seventh generation of video game consoles. It was first released on November 11, 2006, in Japan, November 17, 2006 in North America, and March 27, 2007 in Europe and Australia. - Compact disc (CD) is a digital optical disc data storage format released in 1982 and co-developed by Philips and Sony. The format was originally developed to store and play only sound recordings but was later adapted for storage of data (CD-ROM). Several other formats were further derived from these, including write-once audio and data storage (CD-R), rewritable media (CD-RW), Video Compact Disc (VCD), Super Video Compact Disc (SVCD), Photo CD, PictureCD, CD-i, and Enhanced Music CD. Audio CD players have been commercially available since October 1982, when the first commercially available CD player was released in Japan. - Robert Westerholt (born 2 January 1975 in Waddinxveen, South Holland, Netherlands) is a Dutch musician, known as the guitarist, unclean vocalist and co-founder of the symphonic metal band Within Temptation. He also writes music for the band along with his partner and band vocalist Sharon den Adel. He used to work in human resource management before his career with Within Temptation. - Within Temptation is a Dutch symphonic metal band founded in April 1995 by vocalist Sharon den Adel and guitarist Robert Westerholt. They have always been classified by critics as gothic metal, although the \\"gothic\\" influence varies with each album. Their most prominent and well-known sound is described as symphonic metal, although their earlier material, such as debut album \\"Enter\\", was mostly gothic metal. \\"Enter\\" even had a hint of doom metal. In an interview, Den Adel said they fell into a symphonic rock genre with various influences. In a later interview with Dutch music platform 3VOOR12, den Adel stated that \\"we consider ourselves more a symphonic rock band ... in my opinion, we are no gothic band\\". - A choir (also known as a chorale or chorus) is a musical ensemble of singers. Choral music, in turn, is the music written specifically for such an ensemble to perform. Choirs may perform music from the classical music repertoire, which spans from the Medieval era to the present, and/or popular music repertoire. Most choirs are led by a conductor, who leads the performances with arm and face gestures. - A film score (also sometimes called background score, background music, movie soundtrack, film music or incidental music) is original music written specifically to accompany a film. The score forms part of the film's soundtrack, which also usually includes dialogue and sound effects, and comprises a number of orchestral, instrumental, or choral pieces called cues, which are timed to begin and end at specific points during the film in order to enhance the dramatic narrative and the emotional impact of the scene in question. Scores are written by one or more composers, under the guidance of, or in collaboration with, the film's director or producer and are then usually performed by an ensemble of musicians most often comprising an orchestra or band, instrumental soloists, and choir or vocalists and recorded by a sound engineer. What is the relationship between 'black symphony' and 'gothic metal'? A:","completion":"Black Symphony is a live album, DVD, and Blu-ray Disc by the Dutch symphonic metal band Within Temptation. Symphonic metal, as a subgenre of metal music, often combines classical music elements, such as orchestral arrangements and choirs, with heavy metal instrumentation. Gothic metal, on the other hand, is a fusion genre that combines the heaviness of heavy metal with the dark atmospheres of gothic rock. Within Temptation's music has been classified as both symphonic metal and gothic metal by critics, although they primarily identify as a symphonic metal band. The relationship between Black Symphony (Within Temptation's live album) and gothic metal lies in the band's music style, which incorporates elements of both symphonic metal and gothic metal genres. Some of their songs might have dark themes and atmospheres commonly found in gothic metal, while still maintaining a strong symphonic and orchestral presence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: The Hard Corps Context: Phillip Sauvage (Jean-Claude Van Damme) is an American soldier suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder caused by his time in Iraq and Afghanistan. Sauvage snaps out of his stupor just long enough to join Clarence Bowden (Julian D. Christopher), his former commanding officer, to work as a bodyguard for former World Heavyweight boxing champion and now successful businessman Wayne Barclay (Raz Adoti). It appears that the release of notorious rap mogul Terrell Singletery (Viv Leacock) from prison has caused Barclay's worried sister Tamara (Vivica A. Fox) to take pro-active action by hiring Bowden and Sauvage, as Singletery has made threats in the past about doing away with the one man responsible for his incarceration Barclay himself. The first night of bodyguard work does not go well for Sauvage and Bowden, as Bowden gets killed during an assassination attempt on Barclay by a Hummer full of Uzi-carrying gangbangers sent by Singletery. It is up to Sauvage to continue the fight, which means bringing in a reinforcement in his friend Casey Bledsoe (Mark Griffin), and training some new recruits not of his choosing. Intending to give back to the streets that taught him toughness, Barclay insists that Sauvage compose his team of bodyguards by hiring people from Barclay's gym. But will they be enough to take down Singletery? However, Barclay gets suspicious of Sauvage, who is on first name basis with Tamara, after he sights her kissing him on the cheek one night.

Write a sentence about the following things: bathtub, hang, wall","completion":"The bathtub, an essential component of a modern bathroom, plays a crucial role in our daily ritual of cleansing and relaxation, providing a tranquil sanctuary where one can unwind, soaking away the stresses of the day in warm, soothing water. Made from a variety of materials ranging from traditional porcelain and cast iron to modern acrylic and fiberglass for increased durability and ease of maintenance, the design of a bathtub often mirrors the prevailing style and aesthetic of the bathroom itself, fitting harmoniously into the overall bathing area. Besides its functional aspect, the bathtub can also act as a decorative focal point, particularly in luxury bathrooms where it comes as a freestanding centerpiece, often completed by high-quality brass, chrome or nickel faucets, along with other matching fixtures. Hanging, in the broader sense, is a means of arranging, displaying or storing items in both functional and decorative contexts. One might hang pictures, mirrors, wall decorations, clothes, cooking utensils or even plants, making it a very versatile concept relevant to many aspects of everyday life. Hanging items is most commonly done using nails, hooks, or brackets, whether directly on walls or on specific pieces of furniture designed for that purpose, like coat racks, picture rails, or wall shelves. To hang something effectively requires an understanding of the weight and balance of the object, the right tools for securing it safely, and consideration for the aesthetic placement in relation to other elements in the room. The wall, a structural and functional element in architecture, not only defines and separates space but, in interior design, also offers a canvas for creativity and personal expression. Walls protect us from the elements, insulate against noise, and provide vital privacy, but beyond these practical considerations, they present us with opportunities for decoration, embellishment, and showcasing of art and mementos. Enhancing the wall with color, texture or pattern through choices of paint, wallpaper or paneling can dramatically affect the atmosphere of a room, making it feel cozy, elegant, vibrant, calming, or any other mood we desire. Lighting fixtures, shelves, mirrors, pictures or sculptures hung on the wall can also significantly contribute to the overall design scheme, making the wall an integral part of the architectural narrative of a space."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It had been a habit she inherited from her mother, who held a deep-rooted belief that longer hair held powers and connected one to their ancestors. Growing up, Mary always felt a sense of pride in the length of her hair, as it cascaded down her back like a thick crimson waterfall. In contrast, Sarah preferred to keep her hair short; neat and practical, just like her personality. Sarah was the polar opposite of Mary - logical, analytical, and always questioning the status quo. Their contrasting hairstyles perfectly symbolized their differing worldviews. The two sisters grew up in a small, quaint village where traditions and folklore were deeply entrenched in the fabric of everyday life. Mary loved listening to the folktales passed down through generations and weaving them into her own life. She was a dreamer, her vivid imagination fueled by the mystical currents that ran through the stories. Sarah, on the other hand, was the realist. She preferred science and relied heavily on facts and reason. Despite their differences, the sisters shared a bond that was stronger than iron. One day, the sisters were walking through the village market, and they happened upon a mysterious old woman selling trinkets and charms. Mary's eyes sparkled at the sight of the unique and mystical items, while Sarah simply rolled her eyes, convinced they were nothing more than baseless superstitions. As they approached the stall, the old woman glanced up, her eyes locking onto Mary's flowing hair. There was something about Mary that intrigued the woman, something she had seen only in those who wholeheartedly embraced the magical history of the village. \\"Your hair,\\" she croaked, pointing at Mary, \\"it holds great power. With it, you are connected to the souls of your ancestors. Their wisdom and strength are yours to wield.\\" She then bitterly commented on Sarah's short hair is causing her disconnection to any form of power. Mary's eyes widened with excitement at the old woman's words, while Sarah scoffed skeptically. In an attempt to bridge the gap between the sisters' beliefs and to validate the power that Mary's hair possessed, the old woman handed her a small pendant. It was a beautifully crafted amulet, embedded with a single enchanted gemstone that shimmered in the sunlight. \\"If you truly wish to unlock the power within you,\\" the old woman whispered, \\"hold onto this pendant and allow it to guide you on a journey into the depths of your ancestral heritage.\\" Mary hesitated for a moment, glancing at Sarah, who wore a look of disdain and disbelief. However, trusting her instincts and the pull of her heritage, Mary took the amulet with trembling fingers, feeling an inexplicable surge of energy coursing through her body. That night, as the sisters lay in their beds, Mary clutched the amulet tightly in her hand. The moonlight cast its glow upon her long, flowing hair. Feeling a strange sensation, she closed her eyes and whispered the incantation the old woman had taught her. In an instant, she was transported to another realm, a spirit world filled with the souls of her ancestors. She met them one by one, listening to their stories and exchanging words of love and gratitude. She learned the ancient secrets that had been passed down over generations and the true power that her long hair embodied. Upon returning to her own reality, Mary was forever changed. She had gained not only a connection to her ancestors but also an understanding of her heritage and the power that long hair held within their culture. Her long hair was more than just a style preference; it was a connection to the world beyond their own. With each strand, she felt a connection to her roots – a source of wisdom, strength, and identity. Sarah, although still skeptical, noticed a significant change in her sister. Over time, she began to envy Mary's transformation and her connection to the mystical powers hidden within her. Realizing that perhaps there was more to the world than what she had been taught, Sarah began to grow her hair out, even if just a little. Inch by inch, she learned to appreciate the history and traditions of her ancestors, walking hand in hand with her sister Mary in a journey of self-discovery and the embrace of the mystical powers that flowed within them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: Who opposed the inclusion in the 1991 draft of the Constitution of Belarus?, using the article: The term Belorussia (Russian: Белору́ссия, the latter part similar but spelled and stressed differently from Росси́я, Russia) first rose in the days of the Russian Empire, and the Russian Tsar was usually styled \\"the Tsar of All the Russias\\", as Russia or the Russian Empire was formed by three parts of Russia—the Great, Little, and White. This asserted that the territories are all Russian and all the peoples are also Russian; in the case of the Belarusians, they were variants of the Russian people.After the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, the term \\"White Russia\\" caused some confusion, as it was also the name of the military force that opposed the red Bolsheviks. During the period of the Byelorussian SSR, the term Byelorussia was embraced as part of a national consciousness. In western Belarus under Polish control, Byelorussia became commonly used in the regions of Białystok and Grodno during the interwar period.The term Byelorussia (its names in other languages such as English being based on the Russian form) was only used officially until 1991, when the Supreme Soviet of the Byelorussian SSR decreed by law that the new independent republic should be called Republic of Belarus (Республика Беларусь spelled in Russian), and that its abridged form should be \\"Belarus\\". The law decreed that all the forms of the new term should be transliterated into other languages from their Belarusian language forms. The use of Byelorussian SSR and any abbreviations thereof were allowed from 1991 to 1993. Conservative forces in the newly independent Belarus did not support the name change and opposed its inclusion in the 1991 draft of the Constitution of Belarus.Accordingly, the name Byelorussia was replaced by Belarus in English. Likewise, the adjective Belorussian or Byelorussian was replaced by Belarusian in English. Belarusian is closer to the original Belarusian term of bielaruski. Belarusian intelligentsia in the Stalin era attempted to change the name from Byelorussia to a form of Krivia because of the supposed connection..., what would be the answer ?

However, Palin appeared unfazed by the rumors as she focused her energy on supporting Senator Pat Roberts. Her endorsement of the Kansas Senator is a strategic move to boost his re-election campaign, as Palin's influence and popularity among conservative circles remain significant. Addressing a lively crowd of supporters, she praised Roberts for his commitment to conservative values and urged voters to cast their ballots in his favor in the upcoming elections.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q: In this task, you are given a set of context paragraph and some supporting facts to answer a question. Your task is to generate answer for given question based on set of context paragraphs and supporting facts. Context_1 : This is a list of avant-garde metal artists, regional scenes, and record labels. Avant-garde metal or avant-metal, also known as experimental metal, is a subgenre of heavy metal music loosely defined by use of experimentation and characterized by the use of innovative, avant-garde elements, large-scale experimentation, and the use of non-standard and unconventional sounds, instruments, song structures, playing styles, and vocal techniques. It evolved out of progressive rock and various forms of metal, including extreme metal, particularly the extreme subgenre death metal. Some early examples are the King Crimson releases \\"Larks' Tongues in Aspic\\" and \\"Red\\" in 1973 and 1974 respectively, and the 1976 Led Zeppelin album \\"Presence\\". The genre emerged in the early 1980s through the efforts of bands such as Celtic Frost and Voivod, who pioneered the genre. Other pioneers of avant-garde metal include Boris, Earth, Helmet, maudlin of the Well, Neurosis, Sunn O))), and Mr. Bungle. In the late 1990s, Misanthropy Records emerged as a promoter of Norwegian avant-garde metal until it folded in 2000, and, according to Jeff Wagner, in the late 1990s and early 2000s, a so-called \\"new wave of avant-garde metal\\" was spearheaded by The End Records. Some other record labels which promote avant-garde metal are Aurora Borealis, The Flenser, Holy Records, Hydra Head Records, Ipecac Recordings, Napalm Records, the Relapse Entertainment imprint of Relapse Records, Seventh Rule Recordings, and Southern Lord Records. In the United States, local avant-garde metal scenes have emerged in the San Francisco Bay Area, with bands such as Giant Squid, Grayceon, and Ludicra, Boston, with bands such as Isis, Kayo Dot, and maudlin of the Well and Seattle. According to the \\"New York Times\\", some regional scenes that developed in the mid-1990s included the cities of Tokyo, Los Angeles, and Oslo. Context_2 : Metalcore is a broad fusion genre of extreme metal and hardcore punk. Its subgenres include mathcore and melodic metalcore. This incomplete list includes bands described as performing any of these styles, including those who also perform other styles (with the exception of deathcore bands, which fuse metalcore with death metal and are listed separately). Context_3 : The band was first formed under the name \\"Corpse Molestation\\" and at the time played Black Death Metal with five demos and one demo compilation under the name. Their lyrical themes involved death, war and blasphemy. The band also used pseudonyms instead of actual names to hide their identity. They were one of the pioneers of Australian black metal and extreme metal, recording two black/death metal albums in the mid-nineties before breaking up. Their style was raw and furious, taking off from the old-school black metal style found in such bands as Bathory, Sarcófago, Beherit, and Blasphemy. Many members of Bestial Warlust went on to form Deströyer 666 and participate in other Australian extreme metal acts. Context_4 : Blackgaze is a fusion genre combining elements of black metal and shoegazing. The word is a blend of the names of the two genres, described by \\"The Guardian\\" as \\"the buzz term for a new school of bands taking black metal out of the shadows and melding its blast beats, dungeon wailing and razorwire guitars with the more reflective melodies of post-rock, shoegaze and post-hardcore.\\" According to \\"Exclaim!\\", blackgaze \\"marries the harsh, alien instrumentation of black metal with the mellower, dreamy soundscapes of shoegaze.\\" Influenced by atmospheric black metal bands like Ulver and Summoning, the genre was pioneered by French musician Neige around 2005 through the projects Alcest and Amesoeurs and has risen to prominence with the success of American group Deafheaven. \\"The Guardian\\" named Deafheaven \\"blackgaze's de facto poster boys, the most likely to open up black metal to an even wider audience\\", and \\"Exclaim!\\" described their second album \\"Sunbather\\" – the most critically acclaimed album of 2013 on Metacritic – as seminal to blackgaze. Context_5 : Extreme metal is a loosely defined umbrella term for a number of related heavy metal music subgenres that have developed since the early 1980s. It has been defined as a \\"cluster of metal subgenres characterized by sonic, verbal and visual transgression\\". The term usually refers to a more abrasive, harsher, underground, non-commercialized style or sound associated with the speed metal, thrash metal, death metal, black metal and doom metal genres. With the exception of doom metal, all of these genres are characterized by fast tempos, attesting to their roots in hardcore punk, which has also fused with extreme metal in the forms of crossover thrash, crust punk, grindcore, sludge metal and metalcore. Though many extreme sub-styles are not very well known to mainstream music fans, extreme metal has influenced an array of musical performers inside and outside heavy metal. Context_6 : Slice The Cake was an international Progressive Deathcore group spanning from Australia, England, and Sweden. Formed in 2009, the trio consisted of vocalist Gareth Mason, instrumentalist Jonas Johansson, and composer Jack \\"Magero\\" Richardson. Although the band members are all from different countries, they have played a couple shows with stand-ins. They released one EP and 3 full length albums before they disbanded. Their albums have been released to critical acclaim.<br> Context_7 : The following is a list of deathcore artists. Deathcore is an extreme metal fusion genre that combines the characteristics of death metal and metalcore and sometimes hardcore punk.

Context_8 : Gothic metal (or goth metal) is a fusion genre combining the heaviness of heavy metal with the dark atmospheres of gothic rock.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q:Information: - Pissed Jeans are an American noise rock/hardcore punk band from Allentown, Pennsylvania. The band claims to play \\"loud, heavy, noisy, punk rock\\" and is influenced by 1980s hardcore punk and post-hardcore bands. The band have released several 7\\" singles and four albums, and are currently signed to Sub Pop. In March 2013, Pissed Jeans was named one of Fuse TV's 30 must-see artists at SXSW. - Hardcore punk (often abbreviated to hardcore) is a punk rock music genre that originated in the late 1970s. It is generally faster, harder, and more aggressive than other forms of punk rock. Its roots can be traced to earlier punk scenes in San Francisco and Southern California which arose as a reaction against the still predominant hippie cultural climate of the time and was also inspired by New York punk rock and early proto-punk. New York punk had a harder-edged sound than its San Francisco counterpart, featuring anti-art expressions of masculine anger, energy and subversive humor. Hardcore punk generally disavows commercialism, the established music industry and \\"anything similar to the characteristics of mainstream rock\\" and often addresses social and political topics. - Post-hardcore is a punk rock music genre that derives from hardcore punk, maintaining hardcore's aggression and intensity, but emphasizes a greater degree of creative expression initially inspired by post-punk and noise rock. Like post-punk, the term has been applied to a broad constellation of groups. The genre took shape in the mid to late 1980s with releases by bands from cities that had established hardcore scenes, such as Fugazi from Washington, D.C. as well as groups such as Big Black and Jawbox that stuck closer to post-hardcore's noise rock roots. - Noise rock is a style of experimental rock rooted in noise music. The genre, which gained prominence in the 1980s, makes use of the traditional instrumentation and iconography of rock music, but incorporates atonality and especially dissonance, and frequently discards typical songwriting conventions. Noise rock developed from early avant-garde music, sound art, and rock songs featuring extremely dissonant sounds and electronic feedback. The New York no wave scene, featuring such artists as Mars and Teenage Jesus and the Jerks in the late 1970s, was an essential development in noise rock. - Hope For Men is a 2007 album by Pissed Jeans . The lyrics of many of the songs are about very mundane subjects , such as eating ice cream and scrapbooking , in sharp contrast to the frenzied vocals and loud , off - key instrumentals . The tracks \`\` Scrapbooking '' and \`\` The Jogger '' are essentially spoken - word tracks , the latter with a crashing guitar backdrop . - Sub Pop is a record label founded in 1986 by Bruce Pavitt. In 1988, Sub Pop Records LLC was formed by Pavitt and Jonathan Poneman in Seattle, Washington. Sub Pop achieved fame in the late 1980s for first signing Nirvana, Soundgarden, Mudhoney and many other bands from the Seattle alternative rock scene. They are often credited with taking the first steps toward popularizing grunge music, and have continued to achieve critical and commercial success in the new millennium, with bands such as Fleet Foxes, Foals, Beach House, The Postal Service, Flight of the Conchords, Sleater-Kinney, Blitzen Trapper, No Age, Wolf Parade and The Shins on their roster. In 1995 the owners of Sub Pop sold a 49% stake of the label to the Warner Music Group. - Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats. The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl.

Wolfdog One of the issues that many researchers and wolfdog communities are faced with is identifying wolfdogs from pure dogs and gray wolf subspecies. The most common method used by various wolfdog communities is phenotyping, a method that involves observing the animal's physical features. This method is often favoured for many in determining the degree of wolf and northern spitz-type dog that is in a wolfdog. However, a lot of criticisms have been made by opponents within some communities who tend to point out that phenotyping cannot always determine the wolf-contents accurately. Another challenge involves determining exactly the domestic breeds and wolf subspecies involved in the admixture due to the fact that dogs are known to come in various breeds while gray wolves in turn come in various subspecies with many different regional ecotypes hence have different physical features depending on the subspecies used in the breeding. Although wolves are often mixed with spitz types such as Siberian Huskies, Alaskan Malamutes, and German Shepherds, admixture between wolves with non-Spitz type dogs such as Poodles, Pit bulls, and Great Pyrenees also exist, the latter wolfdogs often having less lupine features. Choose from: 1). no 2). yes Is this statement correct \\"is a german shepherd considered a wolf hybrid\\"?","completion":"1). no A German Shepherd isn't considered a wolf hybrid.

I found I loved being swollen.; Write a story that ends with: 1).","completion":"Once upon a time, in a small village nestled at the foot of a great mountain, there lived a young woman named Aliah. She was known for her kind heart, her infectious laughter, and her unrivaled agility. From an early age, Aliah had been fascinated by the act of movement - running, jumping, climbing - anything that allowed her to challenge her boundless energy. Up on the mountaintop overlooking the village, there was a temple. This temple had a legend surrounding it - it was said to house the Garden of Souls, a place where the balance of life and hardship, love and pain, was said to be maintained. It was believed that, upon completing a treacherous climb, one would find the answers to inner peace at the summit. On the day of her 18th birthday, Aliah decided to undertake the climb. She believed that if she could reach the temple, she would emerge from it with the wisdom needed to truly understand her place in the world and fulfill her potential. The villagers wished her luck, but many feared for her safety. Only the most seasoned climbers had ever made it to the summit, and Aliah, despite her agility, was not one of them. Aliah set off on her journey, scaling the craggy, merciless mountain path with a grim determination. The wind howled, biting against her flesh as she clambered higher and higher. As she climbed, she began to realize that the mountain itself seemed alive, fighting back against her progress. Though she had prepared herself mentally, she struggled emotionally, dealing with not only the physical pain but also a deep inner turmoil. The climb was arduous and tested the limits of Aliah's resolve. During one fateful stretch, as she reached for a rock above her, the ground beneath her feet crumbled away. She fell, her body slamming into the rocks below. Pain exploded throughout her, akin to a fire igniting her nerves. Her ankle, she knew, had been badly sprained. For days she lay incapacitated, her heart heavy with frustration and sorrow. She worried that all her efforts were in vain and that she would never find the answers she sought. Her only hope was that she might find a way to get back on her feet and continue the climb. As the days turned to weeks, Aliah found solace in the beauty of the mountain, the lush, rich wildlife that flourished around her. She realized that life was not only about the heights we scaled but also the valleys we traversed. Time and again, she found herself appreciating the colors of the wildflowers, the serenity of the clear blue sky, and the whispers of the wind as it brushed against her cheek. And listening to the quiet song of the mountain, Aliah began to heal. One morning, as the sun crept over the horizon, she felt something within her shift. The pain in her ankle had faded to a dull ache like a distant memory. Aliah gingerly placed her weight on the joint, finding that she could stand without unbearable discomfort. Taking a step, and then another, she felt a surge of gratitude and excitement welling within her chest. Against all odds, her strength was returning. With the love and energy of the mountain now a part of her, Aliah embraced the expedition ahead, knowing that she would reach the summit and the temple sooner than she had ever imagined. After countless trials and months spent on the mountain, she finally arrived at the temple. There, she found solace in her hardships and learned invaluable lessons on appreciating the present moment, on embracing love for the world around her, and the courage to face adversity. And when Aliah descended the mountain and returned to her village, all could see the peace in her eyes. The harsh lessons of the climb revealed to her the core of her inner resilience. She knew now the value of hardships and challenges, for they led her to find the strength within her soul she never knew existed. In the end, after all of the heartache and pain she had suffered, Aliah discovered that she could heal - not just from physical wounds but from emotional ones as well. And so, with her spirit renewed and her heart buoyed by the wisdom she had gained, she lived her days with the bittersweet knowledge that eventually, she healed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the question...what does pvc stand for in medical terms??","completion":"In medical terms, PVC stands for Premature Ventricular Contraction. It is a type of abnormal heart rhythm, or arrhythmia, which occurs when the heart's ventricles contract earlier than they should, interrupting the regular heartbeat cycle. The ventricles are the lower chambers of the heart that pump blood to the rest of the body. Normally, the heart has an organized and synchronized rhythm of contractions, but in some cases, this rhythm can be disrupted. There are several potential triggers for PVCs, such as stress, anxiety, caffeine or alcohol intake, drug use, and certain medical conditions like an electrolyte imbalance or heart-related issues. In addition, PVCs can also be idiopathic, which means they occur without an identifiable cause. Patients who experience Premature Ventricular Contractions may feel palpitations, skipped beats, fluttering, or an irregular heartbeat. However, they can also be asymptomatic, making the PVCs difficult to detect without medical tests like an electrocardiogram (ECG) or a Holter monitor. Although most PVCs are generally considered benign and do not require extensive treatment, they can sometimes signify more serious heart conditions or increase the risk of other complications. When PVCs are frequent, sustained, or symptomatic, further investigations are needed to assess if there is any underlying structural heart disease. Treatment or management of PVCs depends on the underlying cause and severity of the symptoms. In some cases, lifestyle changes might be recommended, like reducing stress, avoiding caffeine and nicotine, and modifying alcohol intake. For those with a high burden of PVCs, medications such as beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers may be prescribed. In more severe cases where PVCs are related to other significant heart conditions or when medications fail, procedures like radiofrequency catheter ablation can be performed to correct the abnormal electrical pathways. It is crucial to consult with a healthcare professional or a cardiologist if you suspect that you may have Premature Ventricular Contractions or any other form of arrhythmia. Early diagnosis and successful management of PVCs and any related conditions can prevent unnecessary complications and improve overall heart health."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. living things all require energy for survival If a thing is living, it will require","completion":"energy for survival. Energy, in this sense, should be understood as what ignites, supports, and sustains processes that are vital to life. To appreciate this concept, let's visit a few key concepts of biology. First, it's helpful to note that life, in its most basic sense, is a series of chemical reactions. Each organism is a complex system in which this multitude of reactions takes place. Among other things these reactions enable growth, maintenance, repair, and reproduction. Energy drives these chemical reactions. In the context of living organisms, we often refer to this energy as metabolic energy. Metabolism is the set of processes through which an organism perpetuates itself, from creating new cells to breaking down old ones. Each metabolic operation requires energy, and the sum of an organism's energy needs determines its metabolic rate. Energy, which is stored in chemical bonds, enters the world of living things in several ways. The most fundamental is through photosynthesis, a process that occurs in plants and some types of bacteria and algae. During photosynthesis, energy from the sunlight is captured and used to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose, a simple sugar. This stored energy can then be used directly by the organism, or it can be passed on up the food chain when other organisms consume those that create their own food. Another way organisms get energy is through consuming and breaking down other organisms or their by-products. For example, many animals survive by eating plants or other animals. During digestion, the complex organic molecules found in food - like carbohydrates, fats, and proteins - are broken down into simpler compounds. This process releases the energy stored in the plants or animals that are consumed. The body then uses this released energy to power growth and repair, to maintain internal temperature, and to fuel the many other chemical reactions that support life. In cells, for example, this energy enables the synthesis of proteins from amino acids, the transport of substances across cell membranes, and the propagation of nerve impulses. The energy released from food is also used to create a molecule called ATP (Adenosine triphosphate), known as the \\"molecular unit of currency\\". ATP is a high-energy molecule that stores and transports chemical energy within cells. When a cell needs energy to perform a function, it breaks the bond in ATP molecules to release energy. The amount of ATP an organism can produce is directly associated with its survival. In summary, energy is essential for life as it facilitates the biological and metabolic processes that enable growth, repair, and reproduction. Whether it's transforming sunlight into glucose or breaking down other organisms for fuel, the struggle to acquire and use energy is central to the life of every organism. It's a cycle, from sun to plant from plant to animal or from animal to other animals, and finally back to the environment again. This constant flow of energy in, through, and out of organisms is one of the defining characteristics of life on Earth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: CHAPTER REVIEW 4.1 Types of Tissues The human body contains more than 200 types of cells that can all be classified into four types of tissues: epithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous. Epithelial tissues act as coverings controlling the movement of materials across the surface. Connective tissue integrates the various parts of the body and provides support and protection to organs. Muscle tissue allows the body to move. Nervous tissues propagate information. The study of the shape and arrangement of cells in tissue is called histology. All cells and tissues in the body derive from three germ layers in the embryo: the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. Different types of tissues form membranes that enclose organs, provide a friction-free interaction between organs, and keep organs together. Synovial membranes are connective tissue membranes that protect and line the joints. Epithelial membranes are formed from epithelial tissue attached to a layer of connective tissue. There are three types of epithelial membranes: mucous, which contain glands; serous, which secrete fluid; and cutaneous which makes up the skin.

Similarly , Friday has also been a sign of bad luck to many people , with incidents like Jesus being crucified on this unfaithful day , contributing to this belief . It is also widely believed that Cain killed Able on this very day of the week . The fear of Friday the 13th is known as friggatriskaidekaphobia and paraskevidekatriaphobia , the former combining the words frigga , meaning Friday , and triskaidekaphobia , meaning the phobia of number 13 .

It is mandatory that the singer's repertoire include works written in English, Latin, Italian, German, and French.

Greg had met Fontana a few months earlier when she brought her 13-year-old brother to the studio to enroll for guitar lessons. The boy was holding a U.S. made, 1968 Harmony acoustic guitar his uncle gave him. The body and the frets were badly worn, but the instrument still played beautifully.

Information: - The French Revolution was a period of far-reaching social and political upheaval in France that lasted from 1789 until 1799, and was partially carried forward by Napoleon during the later expansion of the French Empire. The Revolution overthrew the monarchy, established a republic, experienced violent periods of political turmoil, and finally culminated in a dictatorship under Napoleon that rapidly brought many of its principles to Western Europe and beyond. Inspired by liberal and radical ideas, the Revolution profoundly altered the course of modern history, triggering the global decline of absolute monarchies while replacing them with republics and liberal democracies. Through the Revolutionary Wars, it unleashed a wave of global conflicts that extended from the Caribbean to the Middle East. Historians widely regard the Revolution as one of the most important events in human history. - Angers is a city in western France, about southwest of Paris.

Background: Joseph Patrick Kennedy Sr. (September 6, 1888 - November 18, 1969) was an American businessman, investor, and politician known for his high-profile positions in United States politics. Kennedy was married to Rose Kennedy, and three of their nine children attained distinguished political positions: President John F. Kennedy (1917-1963), Attorney General and Senator Robert F. Kennedy (1925-1968), and longtime Senator Edward M. \\"Ted\\" Kennedy (1932-2009). He was a leading member of the Democratic Party and of the Irish Catholic community. Context: After Kennedy graduated from Harvard in 1912 with an A.B. in economics, he took his first job as a state-employed bank examiner; this allowed him to learn a great deal about the banking industry. In 1913, the Columbia Trust Bank, in which his father held a significant share, was under threat of takeover. Kennedy borrowed 45,000 (1,114,242 today) from family and friends and bought back control. At age 25, he was rewarded by being elected the bank's president. Kennedy told the press he was \\"the youngest\\" bank president in America. Kennedy emerged as a highly successful entrepreneur who had an eye for value. For example, he was real estate investor who turned a handsome profit from ownership of Old Colony Realty Associates, Inc., which bought distressed real estate. During World War I, President Woodrow Wilson asked the Intercontinental Rubber Company--owned by Bernard Baruch, J. P. Morgan and Kennedy--to grow guayule. Guayule is a plant that produces latex that can be used to make rubber. Many feared the German navy might blockade rubber shipments from Asia. As a result, Intercontinental established the Continental Farm and the little town of Continental in southeastern Arizona in 1916. The guayule growing operations didn't last and in 1922 the Continental Farm was sold to Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, who rented the fields to cotton farmers for several years. Although he was skeptical of American involvement in the war, Kennedy sought to participate in war-time production as an assistant general manager of a major Bethlehem Steel shipyard in Quincy, Massachusetts. There he oversaw the production of transports and warships. Through this job, he became acquainted with Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the story that is loosely based on Torquato Tasso's epic poem Gerusalemme liberata? Rinaldo (HWV 7) is an opera by George Frideric Handel, composed in 1711, and was the first Italian language opera written specifically for the London stage. The libretto was prepared by Giacomo Rossi from a scenario provided by Aaron Hill, and the work was first performed at the Queen's Theatre in London's Haymarket on 24 February 1711. The story of love, war and redemption, set at the time of the First Crusade, is loosely based on Torquato Tasso's epic poem Gerusalemme liberata (\\"Jerusalem Delivered\\"), and its staging involved many original and vivid effects. It was a great success with the public, despite negative reactions from literary critics hostile to the contemporary trend towards Italian entertainment in English theatres. Handel composed Rinaldo quickly, borrowing and adapting music from operas and other works that he had composed during a long stay in Italy in the years 1706–10, during which he established a considerable reputation. In the years following the premiere, he made numerous amendments to the score. Rinaldo is regarded by critics as one of Handel's greatest operas. Of its individual numbers, the soprano aria \\"Lascia ch'io pianga\\" has become a particular favourite, and is a popular concert piece. Handel went on to dominate opera in England for several decades. Rinaldo was revived in London regularly up to 1717, and in a revised version in 1731; of all Handel's operas, Rinaldo was the most frequently performed during his lifetime. After 1731, however, the opera was not staged for more than 200 years. Renewed interest in baroque opera during the 20th century led to the first modern professional production in Handel's birthplace, Halle, Germany, in 1954. The opera was mounted sporadically over the following thirty years; after a successful run at New York's Metropolitan Opera in 1984, performances and recordings of the work have become more frequent worldwide.

This is an opera composed by George Frideric Handel in 1711, it was specifically written for the London stage - the first Italian language opera to do so. The scenarios for libretto were provided by Aaron Hill, and it was prepared by Giacomo Rossi. Rinaldo was first performed at the Queen's Theatre in London's Haymarket on 24 February 1711. The narrative centralizes around love, war, and redemption set against the backdrop of the First Crusade. Despite critical reaction from literary critics who were against the growing Italian entertainment trend in English theatres, Rinaldo was well-received by the public. The opera owes its creation to Handel's considerable reputation while he was in Italy from the years 1706-1710, along with subsequent amendments to its score.

Product review: Okay, I normally get through a good book in a week, with one this long, maybe 2-3 weeks, but it's been 5 weeks since I started this book & I'm only on page 191 (out of 1000+). This book reads more like a political statement than a novel (e.g., abortion, foreign affairs, the economy - & remember I'm not even 200 pages in yet). A suspense thriller is not the right place to get up on a soapbox Mr. Clancy. Your views, and your need to express them so strongly in your book, is making you predictable, sir. And being able to surmise the trend & tone (if not the events) of the rest of the story is the last thing I want from this type of book, especially with 800 pages left. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? Answer:","completion":"This review does not depict the product in a flattering light. While the reviewer acknowledges that they usually enjoy a good book and points out that the one in question is exceedingly long, the bulk of the review is filled with criticisms. Firstly, the reviewer is unsatisfied with the book's pace, noting that it has taken them five weeks to get to only page 191 of a 1000+ page tome. This suggests that the book has been difficult to engage with and perhaps even a bit tedious. The second criticism made by this reviewer is regarding the political content of the book. According to the reviewer, the author of the book has used it as a platform to make a political statement on topics like abortion, foreign affairs, and the economy. This is not what the reviewer expected from the book, which they identified as a suspense thriller. It seems that the reviewer wanted to be thrilled rather than educated on these political issues. The reviewer further explains their dissatisfaction by pointing out the author’s overt expression of personal views, describing it as a predictable move that deviates from the thrilling nature of suspense novels. Predictability in suspense novels is a significant blow as these books thrive on the unpredictability and constant suspense. Thus, based on the multiple criticisms made by the reviewer, I would say that this review does not depict the book in a flattering light. The reviewer's reference to the Gore/Bush political race in the title indicates their frustration with the excessive politics in the novel. The overall tone is of disappointment and dissatisfaction, showing a failure to meet the suspense and thrill the reviewer was expecting."},{"prompt":"Given the question: - These pores are called stomata - Water is absorbed by the roots - It passes through vessels in the stem on its way to the leaves - Sunlight is absorbed by a green chemical in the leaves.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What are the full scientific names of the mangrove tree species that all have the same characteristics? ? Three species of mangrove trees exist in the region: red (Rhizophora mangle), black (Avicennia germinans), and white (Laguncularia racemosa), although all are from different families. All have the same characteristics: they are tolerant of salt, brackish, and fresh water; they grow in oxygen-poor soil; and they can survive drastic water-level changes. Black and white mangroves excrete salt from under their leaves, and red mangroves filter the salinity of sea water. All species are integral to coastline protection during severe storms. Red mangroves, for example, have far-reaching roots that trap sediments. The trees not only stabilize coastlines, but add land as more sand and decaying vegetation is trapped in the root systems. All three mangroves also absorb the energy of waves and storm surges. The estuaries act as fisheries for fry and nurseries for crustaceans. Shrimp, oysters, crabs, whelks, cockles, and snails thrive in these waters, as do primordial horseshoe crabs (Limulus polyphemus). The region supports a 59 million-a-year Tortugas pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus duorarum) industry, and a 22 million-a-year stone crab (Menippe mercenaria) industry. Between 80 and 90 percent of species that are harvested commercially in Florida are born or spend time in the shallow waters near the Everglades. Oysters and mangroves work in tandem to build up the coastline. The sand around the coastline has minute white particles of quartz and fine shells. When currents are right, oysters grow in colonies or beds, and deposit their shells, reinforcing the bed. Mangrove seeds, called propagules, are full embryos and float in water until they reach a favorable location and take root, often on oyster beds. They shed skin and litter, ensuring other trees will not compete for space and nutrients.Mangroves also serve as excellent rookeries for birds. Wading birds, such as roseate spoonbills (Platalea ajaja), egrets, and tricolored herons (Egretta tricolor) use the mangroves as a nursery, due to the proximity of food sources...

Please answer the following question: Question: Why would a person take drugs? Options: - compliments - more leisure time - not feel pain - make money - successful in life Explain why a human would choose \\"not feel pain\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human might choose \\"not feel pain\\" as the reason for taking drugs due to several factors. These factors can range from physical and emotional pain relief, coping with stress and interpersonal issues, and lessening the burden caused by chronic illnesses or injuries. Let us dissect the motivations that lead an individual to take drugs to not feel pain in a more detailed manner. 1. Physical Pain Relief: One of the most fundamental reasons people take drugs is to alleviate physical pain. This pain could stem from an injury or resulting from a medical or surgical procedure. In these cases, drugs may be prescribed by medical professionals to help patients manage pain effectively. Over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen, are common for minor aches and pains. On the other hand, prescription opioids like oxycodone, hydrocodone, or morphine may be suggested for moderate to severe pain relief. While these medications can be helpful in managing pain, there also exists the potential for misuse, leading to addiction in some individuals. 2. Chronic Illness or Injury: Millions of people around the world suffer from chronic illnesses or long-term injuries that cause them to experience pain daily. Conditions such as fibromyalgia, arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and neuropathy are just a few examples of situations where individuals may feel persistent pain. In such cases, drugs might be taken to help manage this pain and somewhat improve the quality of life for these individuals. 3. Emotional Pain Relief: Emotional pain can be as debilitating as physical pain, and some people may turn to drugs as a way to numb their feelings or escape reality. For instance, individuals facing mental health challenges like depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) might use drugs as a coping mechanism in order to feel temporary relief from their emotional distress. This use of drugs to self-medicate is a possible precursor to addiction and dependence. 4. Coping with Stress and Interpersonal Issues: Life is inherently full of both major and minor stressors. These stressors can be compounded with interpersonal problems, such as issues within familial or romantic relationships, challenges at work, or social pressures. As a result, some individuals might take drugs as a way to briefly escape from or manage these pressures, thus alleviating any associated pain or emotional discomfort. 5. Peer Pressure and Social Acceptance: In some cases, a person might take drugs in an attempt to fit in with a particular group or gain social acceptance. This drive to belong is an innate human desire, and while it is not specifically related to pain relief, it can be motivated by the fear of rejection, exclusion, or loneliness—all of which are uncomfortable emotional experiences. In conclusion, the choice to take drugs to not feel pain is multifaceted and complex, with roots in both physical and emotional well-being. While some individuals may rely on drugs for legitimate medical reasons related to pain management, others may misuse drugs in an attempt to find relief from emotional distress, manage stress, or seek social acceptance. It is essential to understand these motivations and provide support and resources to those in need to prevent addiction and promote overall well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This implies that the Westport Downtown Merchants Association (WDMA) organized or had a role in the event where Harbor Blues performed. It shows that WDMA had an interest in incorporating a musical element (in this case, Harbor Blues' performance) into their holiday festivities. Given the information, we can draw the following conclusion: The Westport Downtown Merchants Association had some form of collaboration or connection with Harbor Blues in the sense that they invited or included this a cappella group into their holiday festivities.

The costumes and sets are especially good but am I alone in thinking that this production (which judging by the length of titles at the end was certainly not a cheap one) wanted badly for a British Court historical etiquette expert beyond the Duchess of York? i.e. Did Princess Victoria really stuff an entire truffle/rissole(?) into her mouth while speaking to the Prime Minister in the company of His Majesty with her mouth full?

The U.S. Senate's Levin–Coburn Report concluded that the crisis was the result of \\"high risk, complex financial products; undisclosed conflicts of interest; the failure of regulators, the credit rating agencies, and the market itself to rein in the excesses of Wall Street.\\" The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission concluded that the financial crisis was avoidable and was caused by \\"widespread failures in financial regulation and supervision\\", \\"dramatic failures of corporate governance and risk management at many systemically important financial institutions\\", \\"a combination of excessive borrowing, risky investments, and lack of transparency\\" by financial institutions, ill preparation and inconsistent action by government that \\"added to the uncertainty and panic\\", a \\"systemic breakdown in accountability and ethics\\", \\"collapsing mortgage-lending standards and the mortgage securitization pipeline\\", deregulation of over-the-counter derivatives, especially credit default swaps, and \\"the failures of credit rating agencies\\" to correctly price risk. The 1999 repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act effectively removed the separation between investment banks and depository banks in the United States. Critics argued that credit rating agencies and investors failed to accurately price the risk involved with mortgage-related financial products, and that governments did not adjust their regulatory practices to address 21st-century financial markets.

Make sure that big important banks and financial companies are managed in a good way, and that they are careful with the risks they take. 3. Help everyone understand more about the money stuff that banks and companies are doing, so that people don't get surprised when something goes wrong. 4. Teach and guide the people who are controlling the money businesses, so they can make better decisions and keep everything safe. 5. Make sure that the people and companies who give ratings or scores to different money products do a good job, so everyone knows if those products are safe or risky. 6.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the answer to this question? who wrote the line a thing of beauty is a joy for ever?","completion":"The line \\"A thing of beauty is a joy forever\\" was written by the renowned English Romantic poet John Keats. This memorable line is the opening of his poem \\"Endymion,\\" which was written in 1818. The poem is a long narrative piece that consists of four books and explores the theme of beauty, love, and the relationship between the two. \\"Endymion\\" revolves around the tale of a young shepherd named Endymion who falls in love with the nymph Cynthia, who turns out to be the moon goddess Diana. The poem delves into Endymion's journey, dreams, and awakening, blending together elements of myth and personal emotions to create a rich tapestry of poetic imagery and allegorical meaning. In the opening line, Keats refers to the enduring impact of beauty on the human soul and its ability to bring happiness and joy even after it fades away. This idea of beauty transcending time and space is a recurring theme throughout the poem and Keats' work in general. The poem captures the essence of Romanticism in its celebration of nature, dreams, and sensual love as sources of inspiration and emotional fulfillment. Endymion's prolonged quest to find the true essence of beauty ultimately leads him to a greater understanding of spiritual love, symbolized by his union with the immortal moon goddess Diana. Therefore, the famous line underscores the timelessness and universal appeal of beauty, which can transcend physical boundaries and emotional barriers to create a lasting impression on the human psyche. In conclusion, \\"A thing of beauty is a joy forever\\" was written by John Keats in his poem \\"Endymion\\" and reflects the poet's strong belief in the power of beauty to provide joy and inspire the human soul. His exploration of this theme in the poem has led to the elevated status of this line and the poem itself within the world of literature."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: 300 vials labeled influenza, dengue found at lab The same federal scientist who recently found forgotten samples of smallpox at a federal lab also uncovered over 300 additional vials, many bearing the names of highly contagious viruses and bacteria. Food and Drug Administration officials said Wednesday the undocumented collection contained 327 carefully packaged vials, listing pathogens like dengue, influenza and rickettsia. Last week the government only disclosed that it had recovered six glass vials of smallpox dating from the 1950s. The new revelations raise serious concerns about the government's ability to secure its collections of potentially deadly pathogens. \\"The reasons why these samples went unnoticed for this long is something we're actively trying to understand,\\" said FDA deputy director for biologics Dr. Peter Marks. The samples, including those labeled smallpox, were found in 12 boxes in a corner of a cold storage room at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, that has been used by the Food and Drug Administration since 1972. FDA officials estimate the collection was assembled between 1946 and 1964 by government scientists. \\"The fact that these materials were not discovered until now is unacceptable,\\" said Karen Midthun, of FDA's director for biologics. \\"However, upon finding these materials our staff did the right thing - they immediately notified the appropriate authorities who secured the materials and determined there was no exposure.\\" FDA scientists said they have not yet confirmed whether the newly disclosed vials actually contained the pathogens listed on their labels. The agency is conducting a nationwide search of all cold storage units for any other missing samples. Investigators destroyed 32 vials containing tissue samples and a non-contagious virus related to smallpox. Several unlabeled vials were sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for testing and the remaining 279 samples were shipped to the Department of Homeland Security for safekeeping. FDA officials said there is no evidence anyone was exposed to any of the agents, which were packed in heat-sealed glass vials with no signs of leakage. The finding of freeze-dried smallpox samples was disturbing because smallpox was declared eradicated in 1980, and world health authorities said the only known samples left were safely stored in super-secure laboratories in Atlanta and in Russia. It was the second recent incident in which a U.S. government health agency appeared to have mishandled a highly dangerous biologic agent. Last month, scores of employees at the CDC in Atlanta were feared exposed to anthrax because of a laboratory safety lapse. The CDC began giving them antibiotics as a precaution. In separate congressional testimony Wednesday, CDC director Dr. Tom Frieden acknowledged that systemic safety problems have for years plagued federal public health laboratories that handle dangerous germs such as anthrax and bird flu. Frieden added that his agency had long thought of the lapses as unrelated accidents.

Context: In the shadow of the Seattle Space Needle, almost alien crystalline forms wrap their deft tendrils through the Chihuly Garden and Glass. Every single petal, bowl, stem and branch of cascading glass has been handblown under the guidance of Washington State native Dale Chihuly (in fact he grew up in nearby Tacoma), and we couldn’t quite believe our eyes. Having discovered this exhibit through the magic of Jaime’s instagram (she’s a self-named Angloyankophile who grew up in Seattle before moving to London) I knew we would have to visit. My photos don’t do the undulating forms any kind of justice; but they might just convey the incredible scale of the exhibition. I’d always been curious to learn more about Chihuly, after being introduced to his incredible sculpture suspended over the V&A Museum information desk, a glowing confection of green and white glass whisps. In 1968, after receiving a Fulbright Fellowship, he went to work at the Venini glass factory in Venice, observing the team approach to blowing glass, which is critical to the way he works today. In 1971, Chihuly cofounded Pilchuck Glass School in Washington State. With this international glass center, Chihuly has led the avant-garde in the development of glass as a fine art. His work is included in more than 200 museum collections worldwide. He has been the recipient of many awards, including twelve honorary doctorates and two fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts. He has also lost an eye to his passion, and now mostly directs the sculpture design and assembly. It was truly amazing. In 1999, Chihuly started an ambitious exhibition, Chihuly in the Light of Jerusalem; where more than 1 million visitors attended the Tower of David Museum to view his installations. In 2001, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London curated the exhibition Chihuly at the V&A. Chihuly’s lifelong fascination for glasshouses has grown into a series of exhibitions within botanical settings. Question: When did the author discover the exhibit Chihuly Garden and Glass?

In the movie, Jeanne, portrayed by Geneviève Bujold, is a young woman living in France during a tumultuous period. The year is 1870, and Napoleon III's reign has ended with a lost war against Prussia, leaving the country in a state of poverty. Despite these challenging circumstances, Jeanne finds love with a photographer named Francis, played by Francis Huster. Francis decides to emigrate to America, and he brings Jeanne with him. The couple settles in a small town located in the still Wild West, setting up a small photo shop to earn their living. Parallelly, a character named David, played by James Caan, is living an isolated life on his farm with his wife, while working as an animal doctor. After two long years, two accidents, and the birth of her child, Jeanne's life finally intersects with David's. During this period, Jeanne has lost a lot, including her love, Francis. She is left alone with a child, and life becomes unbearable in America. Coming to a conclusion, she decides to return to her homeland, France, providing her with a sense of relief and familiarity after the numerous hardships she faced in America. However, just as she is making plans to leave, she meets David. Despite their tragic pasts, Jeanne and David find comfort in each other and slowly and cautiously fall in love. This unexpected love provides her with newfound hope, complicating her decision to return to France. Thus, the answer to the question, \\"Where is Jeanne originally from and where does she decide to return to after experiencing a series of tragic events in her life?\\" is France. France is the place of Jeanne's origins and the place which she decided to return to as a means of seeking solace in her life marked by tragic events."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: People Born in Autumn Live Longer People born in the autumn live longer than those born in the spring and are less likely to fall chronically ill when they are older, according to an Austrian scientist. Using census data for more than one million people in Austria, Denmark and Australia, scientists at the Max Planck Institute in the northern German town of Rostock found the month of birth was related to life expectancy over the age of 50. Seasonal differences in what mothers ate during pregnancy, and infections occurring at different times of the year could both have an impact on the health of a new-born baby and could influence its life expectancy in older age. \\"A mother giving birth in spring spends the last phase of her pregnancy in winter, when she will eat less vitamins than in summer,\\" said Gabriele Doblhammer, one of a team of scientists who carried out the research. \\"When she stops breast-feeding and starts giving her baby normal food, it's in the hot weeks of summer when babies are prone to infections of the digestive system.\\" In Austria, adults born in autumn (October-December) lived about seven months longer than those born in spring (April-June), and in Denmark adults with birthdays in autumn outlived those born in spring by about four months. In the southern hemisphere, the picture was similar. Adults born in the Australian autumn--the European spring--lived about four months longer than those born in the Australian spring. The study focused on people born at the beginning of the 20th century, using death certificates and census data. Although nutrition at all times of the year has improved since then, the seasonal pattern persists, Doblhammer said. But on the other hand, according to a study of more 40,000 people, those born in spring and summer report themselves luckier than those born in autumn or winter. Professor Richard Wise-man who led the research explained that the temperature at the time of birth might influence the development of the brain and seasonal factors make a difference as well.

A coach containing Thomas Renfield (Peter MacNicol), a solicitor from London, and two Transylvanian natives, rocks up a mountanous path. Renfield says he's feeling queasy and one of the helpful natives leans out the window to tell the driver to slow down. Just as he does so, he catches a glimpse of the setting sun and yells for the driver to go faster. The carriage rocks and jerks its way to the closest town.When they arrive, a townsperson opens the door of the carriage, and Renfield tumbles out headfirst. The driver throws his luggage down after him, saying he will go no further tonight. Renfield is forced to walk to his appointment at Dracula's castle, disregarding the townspeople's warnings about vampires as a silly superstition.By the time Renfield arrives, it is dark. He tries to knock at the door, but the knocker crumbles away in his hand. Just then, the doors swing open of their own accord. When Renfield steps in, the doors swing shut again and he turns around in surprise. Behind him, at the top of a long staircase, Count Dracula (Leslie Nielsen) makes his appearance. He stands still at the top of the stairs as shadow creeps forward across the wall in a predatory stance. Dracula scolds it in a foreign tongue and it retreats. Renfield, startled, turns around and is relieved to see the count. Dracula starts to introduce himself and trips on some bat guano, tumbling down the steps. He gets up at Renfield's feet, unharmed. He leads Renfield up the staircase, while his shadow limps across the wall behind him.As they walk up the stairs Dracula passes without incident through a giant spiderweb that is in the way.

Answer:","completion":"To address your concerns about investing in the film proposal for 'Dracula: Dead and Loving It,' I will provide you with information on the expert in obscure diseases, offer analysis on the film's potential, and answer any other questions you may have. Expert on Obscure Diseases: In the context of this specific film proposal, the expert on obscure diseases appears to not be explicitly mentioned in the provided plot synopsis. The focus is primarily on the classic figures associated with the Dracula story, such as Count Dracula and Thomas Renfield, rather than a character specializing in obscure diseases. In the context of the broader Dracula literary and cinematic universe, it could be argued that Professor Abraham Van Helsing functions as the expert on obscure diseases, particularly those related to vampirism. Film Potential Analysis: 1. Genre: This film takes a comedic approach to the classic horror tale of Dracula. Comedy films have a broad audience appeal, making them a moderately safe investment. A mix of horror and comedy can create a unique experience, appealing to fans of both genres. 2. Cast: Leslie Nielsen, known for his roles in comedy films such as 'Airplane!' and 'The Naked Gun' series, plays Count Dracula. His presence may attract his fans and those who appreciate his style of humor. 3. Plot: The Mel Brooks-directed movie appears to be a parody of the more traditional renditions of Dracula. Parody films can resonate with audiences familiar with the source material, potentially generating interest and positive word of mouth if executed well. 4. Director: Mel Brooks, the director, has a track record of successful comedic films, such as 'Young Frankenstein,' 'Blazing Saddles,' and 'Spaceballs.' His involvement in the film could be an indicator of its potential quality and appeal to a wide range of audiences. However, it's important to note that comedy preferences vary, and not all of Mel Brooks' films have been box office successes. 5. Marketability: Films surrounding the Dracula myth have had varying degrees of success, but the character is widely recognized, which increases marketability. A comedic take on a familiar and well-loved story can breathe new life into the tale and create opportunities for fresh marketing campaigns. Additional Points to Consider: 1. Budget: Look into the proposed film budget and whether it aligns with similar successful films in the genre. Striking a balance between production value and costs can impact profitability. 2. Distribution Strategy: Consider the plan for the film's release and distribution. A wide release or a targeted marketing approach may have different implications for return on investment. Ultimately, the decision to invest in the film proposal for 'Dracula: Dead and Loving It' depends on factors such as your risk tolerance, investment strategy, and personal preferences. The comedic approach distinguishes it from other Dracula films, and factors like a known director, established cast, and a recognizable story could contribute to its potential success. However, audience preferences for comedy and the execution of the film's humor are subjective and could dictate its reception in the market."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Emily Nagoski is a badass Ph.D. who teaches human sexuality. She wrote a book – Come As You Are. Here’s a secret: the entire sexology community was eager to get their mitts on her book, it was very exciting. I can’t recall the last time there was that much hullabaloo about one book. In this important book, Dr Nagoski explains the interplay between sexual desire and stress — a concept that gives us a unique insight into what is going on in women’s sex lives. THE ACCELERATOR AND THE BRAKES This concept is a big deal. Think of the accelerator and the brake of a car. Each pedal acts independently from one another; you can press on the accelerator and you can stomp on the brakes. You can even press both at the same time. We don’t often press them at the same time – in fact, I was specifically told NOT to do that in driver’s ed – but anyhow, pretend you do. If you press both pedals all the way to the floor of the car, do you stop or go? That’s right, you STOP! Ok, now get this, your brake pedal is all the stress you have and your accelerator is your sexual desire. In the same way that the brake and accelerator of a car are two separate pedals yet also inextricably linked, so are your stress and your arousal. They are not the same things, yet have everything to do with one another. If your stress level is high, the majority of women have brakes that turn on, meaning, no matter how much sexy stuff is going on around her, she does not want sex at all. It is like she is pressing down the brakes and the accelerator at the same time. This isn’t the case for all women; some women have extremely sensitive brakes or extremely sensitive accelerators. And as Nagoski has found, while this correlation between stress and sexual desire is more common for women, men experience it too (just not quite as often). According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What school did Dr Nagoski graduate from?

Questions: What is likely heard by those going to a party? Options: - smoking pot - happiness - laughter - babies - meet new people Answer:","completion":"At a party, people tend to gather to socialize, have fun, and enjoy themselves. While all of these options may potentially be encountered at different parties, the option that is most in line with common sense and most likely to be heard by those attending a party would be \\"laughter.\\" Laughter is a universal language that signifies happiness, joy, and enjoyment. A party, by definition, is a social gathering where people come together to have a good time. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that laughter will be a common and dominant sound at a party, as it denotes people having fun, engaging in amusing conversations, and simply enjoying each other's company. The option \\"smoking pot\\" may or may not be relevant at a party, depending on the specific gathering and the people attending it. However, this option would not necessarily be representative of all parties and should not be considered as the primary thing that people will hear at a party. The option \\"happiness\\" is an emotion or a state of being and not something you directly hear; though it could be indirectly inferred from the overall atmosphere and people's demeanor. Laughter, as mentioned earlier, is a better choice since it's an auditory experience directly connected to happiness and enjoyment. The option \\"babies\\" could potentially be present at certain types of parties like a child's birthday party or a baby shower. However, they are not usually associated with the concept of a party in general. Thus, this option should not be considered as the most likely to be heard by party attendees. Lastly, the option \\"meet new people\\" is not something heard at a party, but rather an activity or a result of attending the event. It is true that parties provide great opportunities to meet new people, but the question asks specifically for what is likely to be heard. In conclusion, among the given options, \\"laughter\\" is the most suitable answer in line with common sense, as it is a sound that is most likely to be heard by those attending a party.

Q:Given the below context: The inaugural games were held, on the orders of the Roman Emperor Titus, to celebrate the completion in AD 80 (81 according to some sources) of the Colosseum, then known as the Flavian Amphitheatre (Latin: Amphitheatrum Flavium). Vespasian began construction of the amphitheatre around AD 70 and it was completed by his son Titus who became emperor following Vespasian's death in AD 79. Titus' reign began with months of disasters – including the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, a fire in Rome, and an outbreak of plague – he inaugurated the completion of the structure with lavish games that lasted for more than one hundred days, perhaps in an attempt to appease the Roman public and the gods. Little literary evidence survives of the activities of the gladiatorial training and fighting (ludi). They appear to have followed the standard format of the Roman games: animal entertainments in the morning session, followed by the executions of criminals around midday, with the afternoon session reserved for gladiatorial combats and recreations of famous battles. The animal entertainments, which featured creatures from throughout the Roman Empire, included extravagant hunts and fights between different species. Animals also played a role in some executions which were staged as recreations of myths and historical events. Naval battles formed part of the spectacles but whether these took place in the amphitheatre or on a lake that had been specially constructed by Augustus is a topic of debate among historians. Only three contemporary or near-contemporary accounts of the games survive. The works of Suetonius and Cassius Dio focus on major events, while Martial provides some fragments of information on individual entertainments and the only detailed record of a gladiatorial combat in the arena known to survive: the fight between Verus and Priscus.

It’s every man’s worst nightmare: things being over in the bedroom before they've even begun. Now, one expert has a simple solution which can help men control their ejaculation. Marni Kinrys, a U.S. dating coach, says holding in urine for five seconds at a time strengthens the Kegel, or pelvic, muscles. This, in turn, can improve a man’s performance in the bedroom if practised often enough. Holding in urine can control and prolong a man's ejaculation, as this strengthens the Kegel muscles. Previous studies show 40 per cent of men will suffer premature ejaculation at one point (file photo) Kegel, or pubococcygeus (PC) muscles help with bladder function and ejaculation, but become weaker or stretched as men and women age. Ms Kinrys says strengthening these muscles, just as one would strengthen any other muscle group, allows men to last longer between the sheets. When a person stops urinating mid-stream, the Kegel muscles are activated. In a video posted to Youtube, Ms Kinrys explains: ‘Kegel exercises are something you can do everywhere, at every moment in your life. Driving in a car, in your office, sitting at the doctors. ‘They control your pubococcygeus (PC) muscles so you can control ejaculation and prolong ejaculation’ ‘You want to work your way up to 50 reps a day, a rep being clenching your PC muscles for three to five seconds, and then releasing. Working these muscles has been shown to help with premature ejaculation. To identify the muscles sit relaxed and tighten the muscle around the back passage, as if trying to control wind. You should be able to feel the muscle move. With the correct technique you should feel a dip at the base of the penis, while the scrotum moves up slightly. To perform the exercises: sit, stand or lie with your knees slightly apart. Slowly tighten and pull up the pelvic floor muscles as hard as you can for as long as you can. Rest for four seconds then repeat. Build up until you can do 10 slow contractions at a time, holding them for 10 seconds each. Results are only likely to be seen after daily practice for three months. Source: Bladder and Bowel foundation. ‘You start off by doing 1 to 20 reps then work up to doing 50 reps. ‘Then you want to increase the time from 5 to 7 seconds. Keep increasing from there.’ ‘This will help strengthen your PC muscles so you never have to worry about premature ejaculation again.’ Up to 40 per cent of men suffer from premature ejaculation - defined by the International Society of Sexual Medicine as ejaculation 'within a minute' - at some point in their lives. In most men, the cause is simply being unable to control the ejaculatory response, explains Wendy Hurn, urology nurse consultant at Bristol Royal Infirmary. ‘Some may have more sensitive nerve endings, however stress or pressure can also make the problem worse,' she said. Pelvic floor exercises are often used to help male incontinence, especially after surgery such as operations for prostate cancer. Italian research published last year found that carrying out Kegel exercises daily for 12 weeks increased the average ejaculation time four-fould. The average ejaculation time was 31.7 seconds at the beginning of the trial, but after 12 weeks of exercises this had increased to 146.2 seconds (two minutes and 26 seconds). In total, 33 of the 40 men improved within 12 weeks. Only five men showed no significant improvement. Two had dropped out of the trial early, after showing an improvement. Ms Kinrys recommends clenching when going to the loo for three to five seconds, and repeating this 50 times throughout the day. What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"1.

Beats the disease despite it spreading to his lungs, abdomen and brain and doctors giving him a less than 40 per cent chance of survival. 1998: Signs for US Postal team on salary of 200,000 a year. 1999: Wins first Tour de France. 2005: Retires after winning his seventh Tour de France. 2011: After several comebacks with mixed success, announces his retirement 'for good' 2012: After a two year investigation, US federal prosecutors dropped a doping investigation into Armstrong without filing any charges. June 2012: The US Anti-Doping Agency accuses Armstrong of 'the most sophisticated, professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever seen'. January 17, 2013: Armstrong to appear on Oprah amid speculation that he will confess all. Bookmakers have been taking bets on which words Armstrong will use in the interview, with Ladbrookes offering 1/4 for 'sorry', evens for 'confess' and 'innocent' and 1/4 for 'apologise'. They were offering 8/11 that he will burst into tears. If Armstrong were to confess, there could be legal consequences, involving past and present civil cases and possibly perjury. Claim: CEO of the US Anti-Doping Agency Travis Tygart said earlier this week that Armstrong offered the agency a 150,000 donation in 2004. The star's attorney denied the claim. Allegations: Travis Tygart said Armstrong had offered the drugs authority a donation of at least 150,000 during an interview with CBS 60 Minutes Sport. Anticipation: Lance Armstrong is due to appear on Oprah next week, he has spoken to the popular chat show host several times including in 2005. He has testified under oath. that he never used performance-enhancing drugs, which could. theoretically lead to charges if he confessed. Former U.S. track star. Marion Jones spent several months in federal prison for lying to. investigators about her drug use. Tainted success: Armstrong has been stripped of his seven Tour de France titles after the report by the US Anti-Doping Agency. In addition to having his seven Tour de France titles stripped, Armstrong was banned for life from competing, which makes him ineligible for triathlons and other events sanctioned by USADA or the World Anti-Doping Agency. In the interview, Tygart said a representative of Armstrong's approached USADA in 2004 with an offer of a donation of more than 150,000. Asked if it felt like he was being. bought off, Tygart responded: 'It was a clear conflict of interest for. USADA and we had no hesitation in rejecting that offer.' 'It was a clear conflict of interest for USADA,' Tygart said. 'We had no hesitation in rejecting that offer.' Herman denied such an offer was made. 'No. truth to that story,' Herman wrote Tuesday in an email to the AP. 'First Lance heard of it was today. He never made any such contribution. or suggestion.' Tygart also said he had been subject to numerous death threats from anonymous emails and letters. 'The worst was probably putting a bullet in my head,' Tygart said when asked to recall specific details of the letter. He said the threatening letters were turned over to the FBI. Tygart also discussed the pressure he. felt while pursuing the investigation, even after federal officials. decided to shut down their probe. Last. year, two members of Congress called for stronger oversight of USADA,. which receives more than half its 15 million annual budget from the. government. Fall from grace: Armstrong has been accused of running a 'sophisticated' doping programme throughout his cycling career. 'We're always concerned about the grant we get from the federal government,' Tygart said. 'If we're unwilling to take this case and help this sport move forward, that we're here for naught. We should shut down. And if they want to shut us down for doing our job on behalf of clean athletes, and the integrity of competition, then shut us down.' Armstrong lost most of his personal. sponsorship worth tens of millions of dollars after USADA issued its. report and he left the board of the Livestrong cancer-fighting charity. he founded in 1997. He is still worth about a reported 100 million. What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"This article is about the cyclist Lance Armstrong and the doping scandal that took away his seven Tour de France titles. Here are some important things you might want to remember: 1. Lance Armstrong reportedly met with the US Anti-Doping Agency to talk about a 'pathway to redemption' or how he can make things right again. Kinda like when you have to apologize and make up for something wrong you did. 2. Lots of people think that Lance Armstrong might finally admit, or say yes, that he cheated during his cycling career. Even though he has always said no, he didn't, before. 3. Armstrong was accused of running the most clever, and successful doping program in sports. Doping is like when someone takes special medicines to make them play better in sports, but it's not allowed. 4. Armstrong has a chat scheduled with Oprah Winfrey where everyone thinks he'll talk about the whole doping scandal. It's a big deal because he used to be so famous and admired for his victories. 5. If Armstrong does admit he cheated, there could be trouble with the law too. 6. There's a claim that Armstrong once offered a large amount of money like, a donation, to the US Anti Doping Agency, which they rejected. 7. Armstrong has been banned forever from competing in races, so he can't do triathlons or other races managed by the USADA or the World Anti-Doping Agency. 8. As a result of this doping scandal, Armstrong lost a lot of his sponsorships and had to leave the board of the cancer charity he started. I hope that helps you!

Title: Clockstoppers Movie plot: The NSA-funded QT (Quantum Tech) Corporation has slated a project to develop Hypertime, a technology which allows the user's molecules to speed up to the point where the world appears to be standing still. After realizing that such technology, contained within a wristwatch frame, could also be used against the USA, the NSA orders the project stopped. However, the research is farther along than the NSA expected and QT's leader Henry Gates plans on using the technology to control the leader of the NSA and dominate the world. He uses the prototype to stretch the weekend in order to give the brilliant lead scientist Earl Dopler time to fix the remaining glitch in the technology after his henchmen Richard and Jay prevent Earl's incognito departure at the airport. However, the disadvantage of Earl being in Hypertime for too long was him aging rapidly in real time, as his molecular age continued at the same rate despite time slowing down. However, initially unknown to Gates, Dopler had sent a prototype to a former colleague of his named Dr. George Gibbs. His son Zak discovers the watch accidentally and initially uses it for fun, much to the amusement of Francesca, the new girl at school who just moved to the U.S. from Venezuela and on whom Zak has a crush. Once Gates finds out about the leaked prototype, he attempts to retrieve it. He sends his henchmen after Zak who break into his house and search for evidence. Upon learning about the ulterior motive of QT Corporation, Zak sets out to warn his father of the danger he could be in. A chase sequence ensues, with Zak crashing the car into the river and thus damaging the watch. He awakes in the hospital with a broken watch and only by a stroke of luck manages to avoid Jay and Richard again. He then goes in search of somewhere safe to hide in the meantime, after having been accused of stealing a van by the police. In a bid to retrieve the watch, QT Corporation enlists the help of national security agencies and portray Zak and his father as fugitives wanted by the law....

D.C. Police Chief Peter Newsham identified the suspect as Anthony Crawford, 23, of Northwest, who has been charged with first-degree murder while armed. “We don’t have a motive,” Newsham said at a Thursday news conference. He also said that Crawford did not cooperate with police, has a criminal history and that investigators are still combing through it. They will look into whether or not Crawford has any mental health issues. “We feel very confident that we have in our custody the person responsible for this murder,” D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said. Police found Crawford 14th and Girard streets NW Wednesday night. Wendy Martinez, 35, was fatally stabbed while running shortly before 8 p.m. at 11th and P streets NW. “It’s unsettling for anyone who lives in this city to see this happen. It’s an isolated incident. I’m sure that doesn’t bring any level of comfort to the Martinez family,” Newsham said. Bowser said that Martinez was “brutally murdered.” “We expect people to feel safe in any neighborhood. …Logan Circle or Wellington Park. This is an outraged community. This is a woman who should have been going to work today,” she said. Bowser called the stabbing “damaging to our senses of safety.” Martinez’s family says she was recently engaged. A friend of Martinez, Kristina Moore, tearfully read a family statement following the news conference. “We are heartbroken,” Moore said. “Wendy should have been shopping for her wedding dress on Friday.

Tuesday night. Washington Metropolitan Police say 23-year-old Anthony Crawford of Northwest D.C. was detained for questioning late Wednesday night in a park at 14th and Girard Street in northwest Washington in the fatal stabbing of 35-year-old Wendy Karina Martinez. He was later arrested and charged with first-degree murder while armed. Video captured the moments after the Georgetown alumna was stabbed in what police chief Peter Newsham called an \\"unprovoked\\" attack while she was running near 11th and P streets northwest, and she managed to stumble into a nearby restaurant for help. The restaurant's manager, Tommy Wu, showed CBS News correspondent Chip Reid surveillance video of the incident, which appears to show an injured Martinez collapsing as patrons rush to her aid. Newsham said patrol officers who were familiar with the community, with the help of citizen tips, identified the person of interest pictured in the video. Newsham said Crawford lives in northwest Washington and has a criminal history. The motive in the attack remains unknown. Newsham said there was no robbery and no apparent confrontation before the attack, which he said happened \\"very quickly.\\" He said police will probe whether Crawford has any mental health of substance abuse issues. The random attack in the typically safe residential neighborhood shocked the community. \\"I think that this is very unsettling for anyone who lives in this city,\\" Newsham said. \\"This is a very isolated instance -- you don't see crimes like this very much, even in the course of my career. It's a very unlikely thing that occurred at this intersection, but at the same time, I'm sure that doesn't bring any level of comfort to the Martinez family.\\" On Wednesday night, Martinez's family released the following statement: \\"We are deeply saddened by this senseless tragedy. Wendy Karina Martinez was the light of our lives. Not only was she an avid runner, but she was a devout Christian, a wonderful friend, and a driven professional. Everything you hope that a daughter and a friend could be. She was also excited to be planning her upcoming wedding to her fiancé, Daniel Hincapie. They were engaged just last week.\\" FiscalNote, Inc. tweeted Wednesday that Martinez was the technology company's chief of staff. Martinez's family released a statement Wednesday asking for privacy to mourn Martinez, who had gotten engaged last week. Martinez was an avid runner known to run several miles across the city. She lived close to where the stabbing happened, Newsham said.

Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: Vexille Movie plot: By the 2060s, robotics technology has become extremely advanced, including cybernetics. World opinion begins to turn against robotics, leading to the U.N. declaring a unilateral ban on further research in 2067. Japan, being home to robotics pioneer Daiwa Heavy Industries, strongly protests this ban, but is unable to prevent its passage. In protest, Japan withdraws from international politics. All foreigners are deported, and further immigration is prohibited. In addition, the R.A.C.E. network is constructedÂ â 270 off-shore installations that cover Japan with an energy field, nullifying all communication with the outside world and making satellite surveillance impossible. Trade and diplomacy continues, but Japan vanishes from the world scene. Ten years later, the United States Navy special warfare unit \\"SWORD\\" is trying to trap a Japanese informant for Daiwa in Colorado. The instigator, Saito, escapes by cutting off his own leg. Analysis shows the leg is made of bio-metal. SWORD suspects that Japan has concealed extensive development of banned technologies. They embark on an unapproved scheme to infiltrate Japan and to find out the frequency of the R.A.C.E. network, enabling SWORD to gather intelligence on the country. Although the agents successfully enter Japan, they are detected by security forces before they can transmit their data. Vexille is the sole SWORD agent to evade capture, and only her lover Leon survives to be taken to Daiwa's headquarters. Vexille awakens to find Tokyo is now a shanty town ruled by Daiwa. A small resistance movement opposes the company, and uses Vexille's transmitter to successfully transmit the distortion frequency. Maria, the head of the resistance, details the 10 years of secrecy while SWORD studies Japan in shocked horror â the islands are a lifeless wasteland. In 2067, an unknown disease struck Japan and was countered by an experimental vaccine. In actuality, the disease was created by Daiwa and the \\"vaccine\\" was used as an excuse for Daiwa to begin testing... My question: Who is the only SWORD agent to evade capture?

Context: Woodes Rogers (\\"ca.\\" 1679 – 15 July 1732) was an English sea captain and privateer and, later, the first Royal Governor of the Bahamas. He is known as the captain of the vessel that rescued marooned Alexander Selkirk, whose plight is generally believed to have inspired Daniel Defoe's \\"Robinson Crusoe\\". Hypothesis: Woodes Rogers passed away in the summer of 1732. Pick your answer from: (a). Yes; (b). It's impossible to say; (c). No;","completion":"(a). Yes, we can draw the hypothesis that Woodes Rogers passed away in the summer of 1732 from the provided context. The context states that he died on 15th July 1732. In the Northern Hemisphere, which includes England where Rogers was from, July is considered to be within the summer season. Thus, it can be inferred that Woodes Rogers died in the summer of 1732. In addition to his death date, the context provides some of his prominent roles and achievements. As an English sea captain, privateer, and the first Royal Governor of the Bahamas, his significance extends beyond his maritime endeavors. His rescue of the marooned Alexander Selkirk is particularly notable as it is believed to have served as inspiration for \\"Robinson Crusoe,\\" a seminal piece of Western literature penned by Daniel Defoe. So, the context offers both pertinent biographical details as well as more cultural and historical insight into Woodes Rogers' life and impact, one of which is the confirmed fact that he died on 15th July 1732, which falls within summer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. News article: A Flickering 'Torch Song Trilogy' in London Long before America cuddled up with those wholesome gay pixies on “Will and Grace” and “Modern Family,” there was “Torch Song Trilogy,” a play that scratched the surface of a fierce drag queen to discover a lovable Jewish mother with good family values beneath. Arnold was this comforting creature’s reassuringly plain name. The man who created him on the page and the stage, Harvey Fierstein, won Tony Awards for both Best Play and Best Actor in 1983, giving daring and triumphant new breadth to the notion of theater queen. Now Arnold is back in London, a town he first visited in 1985 (when he was portrayed to huzzahs by Antony Sher). And though it may ungallant to say it about a sometime lady, 30 years on Arnold is showing his age. He seems thinner, too, and not just because David Bedella, the accomplished actor playing him at the Menier Chocolate Factory, is many dress sizes smaller than Mr. Fierstein was or because of cuts made to the original, elephantine text. With the shock waves he once set off stilled by the passage of time, Arnold now looks like surprisingly close kin to a couple of other characters who have invaded London in a revival this season: the wise-cracking vaudevillians of Neil Simon’s “Sunshine Boys.” The Menier Chocolate Factory, a hit-spawning napkin-sized theater in Southwark, is undeniably an appropriate place for the resuscitation of “Torch Song,” which runs through August. It was here that “La Cage Aux Folles,” the musical by Mr. Fierstein and Jerry Herman about another maternal female impersonator, was revived (and truly rejuvenated) in 2007. It went on to pick up most awards on offer in the West End and on Broadway, including a Tony for Best Actor for its cross-dressed leading man, Douglas Hodge. Mr. Hodge is the director of the current “Torch Song.” He has staged this production with an ingratiating, crowd-courting sweetness – a trait that was evident in, but only a part of, his barnstorming performance in “La Cage.” His “Trilogy” starts off bubbly – with Mr. Bedella’s Arnold confiding in us in the manner of the title character of “Shirley Valentine” (another Menier hit) – and it proceeds to percolate for nearly three hours. This is true even in scenes of angst-ridden confession and confrontation that touch on enduring hot-button issues like gay bashing, gay marriage and gay adoption. Outsize, neurotic Jewish characters who wisecracked through their tears were hardly new to Broadway when “Torch Song” opened there. Neil Simon had made a fortune from them. But none of these folks, to my knowledge, had been openly and unapologetically gay, or hung out in the backrooms of gay bars. That novelty made the mainstream embrace of “Torch Song” an important cultural milestone. There was also no denying the startling, high-voltage appeal of Mr. Fierstein, whom I first saw as a teenager Off Off Broadway, when he was playing the heroine of a raunchy romp called “Flatbush Tosca.” Even without singing, this foghorn-voiced, plus-size actor had musical-comedy star shine, the kind of lovable grotesqueness associated with the likes of Ethel Merman, Carol Channing and Zero Mostel. Mr. Fierstein may have tailor-made Arnold for himself, but he was such an overwhelmingly emotional presence that he burst the seams of the part. In full rant, his Arnold brought to mind accounts of legendary performances of Yiddish theater on the Lower East Side, where the audience wept and sweated buckets along with the actors. Mr. Bedella, who won an Olivier Award playing the Devil in “Jerry Springer: The Opera,” works hard at emulating Mr. Fierstein’s basso profundo, New Yawk accent and killer comic timing. He is, as he should be, the best reason to see this show. But he’s a precise and compact performer. And for “Torch Song” to have impact, it needs to be kind of a mess, to sprawl with a sense of big, untidy feelings let loose on a stage. Mr. Hodge’s production, attractively designed by the seriously talented Soutra Gilmour (“The Duchess of Malfi”), exudes a picturesque nostalgia for crazy Olde New York, where people went to discos and group therapy. And the cast members – who include Joe McFadden and Tom Harries as two of Arnold’s lovers and Sara Kestelman as his devoted but disapproving mother — often deliver their zingers with an exaggerated sprightliness that suggests what long-forgotten racy 1970s musicals like “I Love My Wife” must have been like. (Their American accents only enhance the sense of artificiality.) Arnold, though a creature of that era, connects with another kind of past, when divas with songs in their hearts and lumps in their throats ruled the screen and the radio. This sensibility is underscored by having the cast members wistfully sing standards like “My Funny Valentine” and “The Man That Got Away” between scenes. They could well have included “I’m Old Fashioned,” too. And why not “Isn’t It Romantic?” Even the group-groping backroom bars here registers as touchingly innocent, summoning a pre-AIDS, pre-Internet moment in gay culture when hook-ups were made in person, condoms had yet to become a life-saving necessity and outrageous guys like Arnold were not yet shrunken to prime-time proportions.

Crawford's father abandoned the family a few months before her birth, reappearing later in 1930 in Abilene, Texas, reportedly working as a construction laborer. On May 8, 1977, Crawford gave away her beloved Shih Tzu, \\"Princess Lotus Blossom,\\" being too weak to care for her. Crawford died two days later at her New York apartment of a heart attack. A funeral was held at Campbell Funeral Home, New York, on May 13, 1977. In her will, which was signed on October 28, 1976, Crawford bequeathed to her two youngest children, Cindy and Cathy, 77,500 each from her 2,000,000 estate. She explicitly disinherited the two eldest, Christina and Christopher: \\"It is my intention to make no provision herein for my son, Christopher, or my daughter, Christina, for reasons which are well known to them\\". She also bequeathed nothing to her niece, Joan Lowe (1933-1999; born Joan Crawford LeSueur, the only child of her estranged brother, Hal). Crawford left money to her favorite charities: the U.S.O. of New York, the Motion Picture Home, the American Cancer Society, the Muscular Dystrophy Association, the American Heart Association, and the Wiltwyck School for Boys. A memorial service was held for Crawford at All Souls' Unitarian Church on Lexington Avenue in New York on May 16, 1977, and was attended by, among others, her old Hollywood friend Myrna Loy. Another memorial service, organized by George Cukor, was held on June 24 in the Samuel Goldwyn Theater at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in Beverly Hills. Crawford was cremated and her ashes were placed in a crypt with her fourth and final husband, Alfred Steele, in Ferncliff Cemetery, Hartsdale, New York. Joan Crawford's handprints and footprints are immortalized in the forecourt of Grauman's Chinese Theater on Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood. She has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1752 Vine Street for her contributions to the motion picture industry.

I had decided to try for a job in radio. One day, I wanted to host a sports program. I went to Chicago and knocked on the door of every station. But I got turned down every time. In one station, a kind lady said my problem was that I hadn't got enough experience. \\" Get some work with a small station and work your way up,\\" she said. I went back home. I couldn't get a job there, either. Then my dad told me a businessman had opened a store and needed someone to help him. But again, I didn't get the job. I felt really down. \\" Your luck will change,\\" Mom said to me. Dad lent me the car to help me to look for my job. I tried another radio station in Iowa. But the owner, a nice man, told me he had already had someone. As I left his office, I asked, \\"How can someone be a sports announcer if he can't get a job in a radio station?\\" I was waiting for the lift when I heard the man call. \\" What did you mean? Do you know anything about football?\\" He put me in front of a microphone and asked me to try to imagine that I was giving my opinion on a football game, I succeeded. On my way home, Mom's words came back to me, \\"One day your luck will change, Son. And when it happens, it'll feel doubly good because of all the hard work you've had.\\" At that moment I knew what just what she meant.

In this context, to be \\"turned down\\" is a colloquial way of expressing refusal or rejection. So, option A is the correct interpretation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Traditionally, Section 1983 was of limited use for a state prisoner under sentence of death because the Supreme Court has held that habeas corpus, not Section 1983, is the only vehicle by which a state prisoner can challenge his judgment of death. In the 2006 Hill v. McDonough case, however, the United States Supreme Court approved the use of Section 1983 as a vehicle for challenging a state's method of execution as cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The theory is that a prisoner bringing such a challenge is not attacking directly his judgment of death, but rather the means by which that the judgment will be carried out. Therefore, the Supreme Court held in the Hill case that a prisoner can use Section 1983 rather than habeas corpus to bring the lawsuit. Yet, as Clarence Hill's own case shows, lower federal courts have often refused to hear suits challenging methods of execution on the ground that the prisoner brought the claim too late and only for the purposes of delay. Further, the Court's decision in Baze v. Rees, upholding a lethal injection method used by many states, has drastically narrowed the opportunity for relief through Section 1983.

Hypothesis: According to a Time piece, Levi Strauss lost a third of its customers to Diesel and Polo. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","completion":"Step 1: Identify key information in both the premise and hypothesis. - Premise: Levi Strauss faces stiff competition from trendier competitors (Diesel, Tommy Hilfiger, Polo). - Hypothesis: According to a Time piece, Levi Strauss lost a third of its customers to Diesel and Polo. Step 2: Compare key information in both statements to see if there is a direct correlation. - Both statements mention Levi Strauss, Diesel, and Polo as relevant parties. - The premise mentions Levi Strauss facing stiff competition from said competitors. - The hypothesis mentions Levi Strauss losing a third of its customers specifically to Diesel and Polo, based on a Time piece. Step 3: Determine entailed status. - The premise does not provide any specific information about market share loss or customer count loss for Levi Strauss. - The hypothesis, on the other hand, provides a specific quantity (a third of its customers) as well as an explicit loss to only Diesel and Polo. It also cites a Time piece that is not mentioned in the premise. Conclusion: The hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, as it provides specific information about Levi Strauss losing customers to Diesel and Polo that is not present in the premise, along with citing an external source.

Q: It's often difficult to remember how or why you became friends with someone, especially if you've been friends with a person forever. But because of the very specific set of circumstances, I remember exactly how Barend and I became friends. This, of course, was long before he became famous for inventing the easy-foldable map, and infamous for the series of bodies he'd decided to bury in his backyard. Barend and I became friends because he had one of the most attractive shadows I'd ever seen. I remember gazing out over the playground, watching a waning sun scatter its dying light over the monkey bars, the metal skeleton contrasting against the turquoise sky, when I noticed this kid coming toward me. He was one of those mostly invisible characters; faded jeans, dirty jacket, snot caked on his upper lip. I probably wouldn't have noticed him if not for his shadow. For some reason, his shadow immediately caught my eye. Now, I'm not one for noticing shadows in general, never really noticed a shadow before or since, but this kid had the most incredible shadow I'd ever seen. I cannot even put in words what that means. What specific set of properties make an ordinary shadow into an incredible one, I'm not sure anyone can, but his shadow was like a piece of art; I didn't necessarily understand it, but I liked it. And that's why this boring looking kid and I first became friends. Our kindergarten games were harmless and boring, but when puberty hit, Barend began to change. We were both expected to change, but I guess some kids just change more than others. Bared didn't want to kill at first. Like many overachievers in the death game, his first brush with the craft came about more or less accidentally. All the elements had been in place, with all the players and attributes coming together as if gathered by some evil force, but, even then, I really had to push the kid.

Spread melted butter in a pan and spread evenly across the pan. You may need to work quickly to incorporate this butter without sticking to the side of the pan.. B). Greasing the pan encourages the cheesecake to pull away from the sides and shrink in. You can use cooking spray, butter, margarine, or shortening to grease the pan.. C). Using a butter knife, lightly grease your pan. If you do not have a butter knife, you can use your fingers, which are readily available on counter tops.. D). Use a butter knife to gently grease the pan using a circular motion as you grease it with butter. If you're using a pinch-of-salt, place the pinch of salt on the inside of the pan before you begin cooking..","completion":"To prevent your cheesecake from cracking, take the time to ensure that the pan is greased properly. Greasing the pan encourages the cheesecake to pull away from the sides and shrink in, reducing the likelihood of the center cracking. You can use various methods to grease your pan effectively. One option is to spread melted butter in the pan, ensuring an even coat across the entire surface. Be mindful that you may need to work quickly so that the butter does not stick to the side of the pan. Another option is to use cooking spray, butter, margarine, or shortening as your greasing agent. Each of these options will provide a lubricated surface for the cheesecake to release from after baking. No matter what you choose, be sure to coat the sides and bottom of the pan comprehensively to avoid any potential sticking. If using a butter knife to grease your pan, a light touch will suffice. If you don't have a butter knife at hand, you can also use your fingers to spread the grease evenly, as long as your hands are clean and the surface is well-covered. In case you're incorporating additional ingredients, such as a pinch of salt, place those on the inside of the pan before starting the cooking process. In summary, proper pan greasing is essential in preventing cheesecakes from cracking. Make sure to thoroughly apply your choice of grease (cooking spray, butter, margarine, or shortening) to the pan's sides and bottom. Addressing this issue will not only result in an aesthetically pleasing cheesecake but also one with a smooth and velvety texture, perfect for every special occasion or simple dessert craving."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - Crepuscular animals are those that are active primarily during twilight (i.e., the period immediately after dawn and that immediately before dusk). It is thus to be distinguished from diurnal and nocturnal behavior where an animal is active during the hours of daylight or the hours of darkness respectively. The term is not precise, however, as some crepuscular animals may also be active on a moonlit night or during an overcast day. The term matutinal is used for animals that are only active before dawn, and vespertine for those only active after sunset. - Tennessee (\\"Tanasi\\") is a state located in the southeastern region of the United States. Tennessee is the 36th largest and the 16th most populous of the 50 United States. Tennessee is bordered by Kentucky and Virginia to the north, North Carolina to the east, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi to the south, and Arkansas and Missouri to the west. The Appalachian Mountains dominate the eastern part of the state, and the Mississippi River forms the state's western border. Tennessee's capital and second largest city is Nashville, which has a population of 654,610. Memphis is the state's largest city, with a population of 655,770. - Kansas is a U.S. state located in the Midwestern United States. Its capital is Topeka and its largest city is Wichita. Kansas is named after the Kansa Native American tribe, which inhabited the area. The tribe's name (natively \\"\\") is often said to mean \\"people of the wind\\" or \\"people of the south wind\\", although this was probably not the term's original meaning. For thousands of years, what is now Kansas was home to numerous and diverse Native American tribes. Tribes in the eastern part of the state generally lived in villages along the river valleys. Tribes in the western part of the state were semi-nomadic and hunted large herds of bison. - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\". - Nebraska is a state that lies in both the Great Plains and the Midwestern United States.

Jacksonville is the most populous municipality in the state and is the largest city by area in the contiguous United States. The Miami metropolitan area is Florida's most populous urban area. The city of Tallahassee is the state capital. - The domestic cat is a small, typically furry, carnivorous mammal. They are often called house cats when kept as indoor pets or simply cats when there is no need to distinguish them from other felids and felines. Cats are often valued by humans for companionship and for their ability to hunt vermin. There are more than 70 cat breeds, though different associations proclaim different numbers according to their standards. - The Mekong giant catfish, \\"Pangasianodon gigas\\" (, ; /\\"try riec\\"/), is a very large, critically endangered species of catfish (order Siluriformes) in the shark catfish family (Pangasiidae), native to the Mekong basin in Southeast Asia and adjacent China. In Thai folklore, this fish is regarded with reverence, and special rituals are followed and offerings are made before fishing it. - The Ictaluridae , sometimes called ictalurids , are a family of catfish native to North America , where they are important food fish and sometimes as a sport fish . It includes about 51 species . They include fish commonly known as bullheads , madtoms , channel catfish , and blue catfish . - Loricariidae is the largest family of catfish (order Siluriformes), with 92 genera and just over 680 species to date, with new species being described each year. Loricariids originate from freshwater habitats of Costa Rica, Panama, and tropical and subtropical South America. These fish are noted for the bony plates covering their bodies and their suckermouths. Several genera are sold as \\"plecos\\", notably the suckermouth catfish, \\"Hypostomus plecostomus\\", and are popular as aquarium fish. - North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and almost all within the Western Hemisphere. It can also be considered a northern subcontinent of the Americas. It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean, and to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea. - Ictalurus is a genus of North American freshwater catfishes. It includes the well-known channel catfish (\\"Ictalurus punctatus\\") and blue catfish (\\"Ictalurus furcatus\\"). - Corydoras is a genus of freshwater catfish in the family Callichthyidae and subfamily Corydoradinae. The species usually have more restricted areas of endemism than other callichthyids, but the area of distribution of the entire genus almost equals the area of distribution of the family, except for Panama where \\"Corydoras\\" is not present. \\"Corydoras\\" species are distributed in South America where found east of the Andes to the Atlantic coast, from Trinidad to the Río de la Plata drainage in northern Argentina.

It has been introduced to Western Europe as a sport fish and is now found from the United Kingdom all the way east to Kazakhstan and China and south to Greece and Turkey. It is a scaleless freshwater fish recognizable by its broad, flat head and wide mouth. Wels catfish can live for at least fifty years and have very good hearing to compensate for their poor sight. - A fish is any member of a group of organisms that consist of all gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered obsolete or paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term \\"fish\\" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification. - Channel catfish (\\"Ictalurus punctatus\\") is North America's most numerous catfish species. It is the official fish of Kansas, Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska, and Tennessee, and is informally referred to as a \\"channel cat\\". In the United States, they are the most fished catfish species with approximately 8 million anglers targeting them per year. The popularity of channel catfish for food has contributed to the rapid expansion of aquaculture of this species in the United States. - Detritivores, also known as detrivores, detritophages, detritus feeders, or detritus eaters, are heterotrophs that obtain nutrients by consuming detritus (decomposing plant and animal parts as well as feces). There are many kinds of invertebrates, vertebrates and plants that carry out coprophagy. By doing so, all these detritivores contribute to decomposition and the nutrient cycles. They should be distinguished from other decomposers, such as many species of bacteria, fungi and protists, which are unable to ingest discrete lumps of matter, but instead live by absorbing and metabolizing on a molecular scale (saprotrophic nutrition). However, the terms detritivore and decomposer are often used interchangeably. - Candiru (English and Portuguese or \\"candirú\\" in Spanish), \\"Vandellia cirrhosa\\", also known as cañero, toothpick fish, or vampire fish, is a species of parasitic freshwater catfish in the family \\"Trichomycteridae\\" native to the Amazon Basin where it is found in the countries of Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. - Callichthyidae is a family of catfishes (order Siluriformes), called armored catfishes due to the two rows of bony plates (or scutes) running down the length of their bodies. This family contains some of the most popular freshwater aquarium fish, such as the species of \\"Corydoras\\". - The blue catfish (\\"Ictalurus furcatus\\") is the largest species of North American catfish, reaching a length of and a weight of . The average length is about 2546 in (64117 cm). The fish can live to 20 years. The native distribution of blue catfish is primarily in the Mississippi River drainage, including the Missouri, Ohio, Tennessee, and Arkansas Rivers, and the Rio Grande, and south along the Gulf Coast to Belize and Guatemala. . These large catfish have also been introduced in a number of reservoirs and rivers, notably the Santee Cooper lakes of Lake Marion and Lake Moultrie in South Carolina, the James River in Virginia, Powerton Lake in Pekin, Illinois, and Springfield Lake in Springfield, Illinois. This fish is also found in some lakes in Florida. The fish is considered an invasive pest in some areas, particularly the Chesapeake Bay. Blue catfish can tolerate brackish water, thus can colonize along inland waterways of coastal regions. - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water. - Missouri (see pronunciations) is a state in the Midwestern region of the United States, achieving statehood in 1821. With over six million residents, it is the eighteenth most populous state and host to the mean center of United States population. The largest urban areas are St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield, and Columbia. The capitol is in Jefferson City on the Missouri River. The state is the twenty-first most extensive by area and is geographically diverse. The Northern Plains were once covered by glaciers, then tallgrass prairie, and now the deep soils yield great agricultural productivity. In the South are the Ozarks, a forested highland, providing timber, minerals, and recreation. The Mississippi River forms the eastern border of the state, eventually flowing into the swampy Missouri Bootheel. - Virginia (, officially the Commonwealth of Virginia) is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, as well as in the historic Southeast. Virginia is nicknamed the \\"Old Dominion\\" due to its status as the first colonial possession established in mainland British America, and \\"Mother of Presidents\\" because eight U.S. presidents were born there, more than any other state. The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population is over 8.3 million, which is slightly less than New York City. - Catfish (or catfishes; order Siluriformes or Nematognathi) are a diverse group of ray-finned fish. Named for their prominent barbels, which resemble a cat's whiskers, catfish range in size and behavior from the three largest species, the Mekong giant catfish from Southeast Asia, the wels catfish of Eurasia and the Piraíba of South America, to detritivores (species that eat dead material on the bottom), and even to a tiny parasitic species commonly called the candiru, \\"Vandellia cirrhosa\\". There are armour-plated types and there are also naked types, neither having scales. Despite their name, not all catfish have prominent barbel. Members of the Siluriformes order are defined by features of the skull and swimbladder. Catfish are of considerable commercial importance; many of the larger species are farmed or fished for food. Many of the smaller species, particularly the genus \\"Corydoras\\", are important in the aquarium hobby. Many catfish are nocturnal, but others (many \\"Auchenipteridae\\") are \\"crepuscular\\" or \\"diurnal\\" (most \\"Loricariidae or\\" \\"Callichthyidae\\" for example). - The Mississippi River is the chief river of the largest drainage system on the North American continent. Flowing entirely in the United States (although its drainage basin reaches into Canada), it rises in northern Minnesota and meanders slowly southwards for to the Mississippi River Delta at the Gulf of Mexico. With its many tributaries, the Mississippi's watershed drains all or parts of 31 U.S. states and 2 Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains. The Mississippi ranks as the fourth longest and fifteenth largest river in the world by discharge. The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana.

S&P 500 in Cheapest Bull Market Since Ronald Reagan Investors have seen 806 billion erased from the value of American equities since President Barack Obama was re-elected Nov. 6 in the biggest decline since May. The post-election rout in U.S. stocks has driven the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX) down so far that it would have to advance 26 percent to reach the valuation of bull markets since John F. Kennedy was in the White House. Investors have seen 806 billion erased from the value of American equities since President Barack Obama was re-elected Nov. 6 in the biggest decline since May. The combination of falling stocks and rising profits as the economy recovers has left the S&P 500’s price-earnings ratio below the ending level of eight of the nine bull markets since 1962 and beneath the average of any since Ronald Reagan was in power. Bears say the 4.8 percent drop in the S&P 500 and valuations show investors are losing confidence that Congress and Obama will reach a budget compromise that would keep the recovery from stalling. Bulls, including the top strategists at six Wall Street firms, say that the declines are another reason to buy and that stock prices from Apple Inc. (AAPL) to Dollar Tree (DLTR) Inc. are bound to improve as earnings increase. “The stock market looks cheap because people are way too pessimistic about what growth looks like for the next 10 years,” said Brian Jacobsen, who helps oversee 208 billion as chief strategist at Wells Fargo Advantage Funds and predicts the S&P 500 will rise 47 percent to 2,000 in 2014. “You can get big and rapid moves in the market when expectations are so low.” Concern about the so-called fiscal cliff -- 607 billion of spending cuts and tax increases that automatically go into effect Jan. 1 -- overshadowed better-than-estimated profit reports from Cisco Systems Inc. and Home Depot Inc. last week, sending the S&P 500 down 1.5 percent to 1,359.88. Obama began face-to-face talks with top Republicans and Democrats on Nov. 16 after he and House Speaker John Boehner said they will work toward an agreement. Boehner and White House Press Secretary Jay Carney described the meeting as “constructive.” Even as shares fall, strategists are optimistic about gains next year. The S&P 500 will rally 17 percent to a record 1,585 by the end of 2013, according to the average forecast. The index climbed 1.3 percent to 1,376.96 at 9:36 a.m. New York time today. Douglas Kass, the founder of Seabreeze Partners Management Inc. in Palm Beach, Florida, who recommended buying stocks at the March 2009 low says the benchmark gauge may rise 18 percent to 1,600 next year as politicians reach a budget compromise and the economy continues to expand. “The No. 1 mistake that is being made is the old proverb, ‘Once bitten, twice shy’,” Kass said in a Nov. 14 Bloomberg Radio interview with Tom Keene. “Market participants today are incorrectly playing the last war, which took place during the budget deliberations in August of last year. Those fears are misplaced.” Savita Subramanian of Bank of America Corp. says the index will rally to 1,600 on rising corporate profits and diminishing concerns about the global economy. John Stoltzfus, at Oppenheimer & Co., forecasts the gauge will climb to 1,585 and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s David Kostin estimates 1,575, based on support from the Federal Reserve’s third round of bond purchases. Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke pledged in September that the central bank will buy 40 billion of mortgage securities a month until the U.S. labor market recovers. Optimism is misplaced unless Obama and Republican leaders are able to agree on measures to avoid the mandated cuts and tax increases, according to James Bianco, president of Bianco Research LLC in Chicago. The 607 billion burden could cause the world’s largest economy to shrink 0.5 percent next year, according to a Nov. 8 Congressional Budget Office report. “Up until the election day no one had priced in a fiscal cliff because the thinking overwhelmingly on Wall Street was there wasn’t going to be one,” Bianco said in a Nov. 14 Bloomberg Television interview. “We’re only now starting to price it in and we’ve only been pricing it in for a week. If we continue to keep our pencils down, there’s going to be a lot more pain.” The economy is recovering at the slowest post-recession rate since World War II, as the housing market stagnated until this year and unemployment stayed above 8 percent through August. Lawmakers of both parties say they want to avoid the fiscal cliff’s economic shock while addressing the deficit. Boehner said Nov. 16 that Republicans are willing to consider revenue- raising measures in exchange for spending cuts. Obama said tax rates should rise without specifying that the top rate must return to the 39.6 percent stipulated. While the S&P 500 has doubled since Obama first took office, the index’s price-earnings ratio was lower than the 16.4 six-decade average for 38 of the rally’s 46 months, as earnings surged, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The multiple is up 35 percent since March 2009, compared with the average expansion of 55 percent in bull markets since 1962, Bloomberg data show. For the past 2 1/2 years, the S&P 500 hasn’t climbed higher than 16 times earnings, compared with the average ratio of 17.4 in past rallies. The valuation rose to a high of 13.8 from 7.3 during the first 15 months of the 1982 advance that pushed the S&P 500 up 229 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In the 1990s rally led by technology companies, it almost doubled to 28.5 during the eight years. “As a country, we go from glum to glee and glum to glee over and over again,” James Paulsen, the chief investment strategist at Minneapolis-based Wells Capital Management, which oversees about 325 billion, said in a phone interview. “After the 2008 recession and the tech bubble, we’re back at glum, so what comes next?” he said. “Confidence, and the ability to rebuild it, is our biggest asset for the future.” Economists predict global GDP will increase 2.6 percent next year from 2.2 percent in 2012, the slowest since it contracted three years ago, according to a survey by Bloomberg. The pace of U.S. growth will be 2 percent in 2013, down from 2.2 percent this year, according to the median of 98 estimates. The tumble since Obama defeated Republican candidate Mitt Romney, with 332 electoral votes to 206, pushed the benchmark gauge to 13.7 times reported profits, lower than the 15.5 average ratio since March 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Only one bull market since 1962 has ended with a lower valuation: the six-year cycle through 1980 in which the index gained 126 percent to 140.52, or 9.1 times profits. The ratio averaged 17.4 during the nine rallies and ended at about 19.9. Reaching the mean level would require a 26 percent gain in the S&P 500, holding earnings constant, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Should profits meet analysts’ 2013 projection, the index would need a 42 percent gain from the Nov. 16 closing price. Earnings are forecast to climb to a record 110.80 a share next year, almost double what companies posted in 2008, analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg show. “Valuations are cheap given what we’ve seen in earnings,” said Hank Smith, chief investment officer at Haverford Trust Co. in Radnor, Pennsylvania. His firm oversees 6.5 billion in assets. “Corporate America is strong, balance sheets are exceptionally strong and flush with cash. We do not believe we’ll have a contraction in earnings next year. We expect profit growth to re-accelerate in the second half of 2013.” Apple, which has fallen 25 percent from its high of 702.10 on Sept. 19 traded at 11.9 times reported profits, a 14 percent discount to its five-year average, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The ratio reached a record 23.3 times income 2 1/2 years ago, even after the Cupertino, California-based company posted record earnings in the first quarter. Profits for Dollar Tree, which sells everything from toys to pet food for 1 or less, will rise 24 percent in fiscal 2013, ending in January, and 13 percent the next year, according to analyst estimates. While the shares have almost tripled since March 2009, the price-earnings ratio at 16.7 is 21 percent below the five-year average. Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV) trades 22 percent below its historic valuation, even though earnings at the Dallas-based company have surpassed analyst projections for the past five quarters and are forecast to rise 65 percent in 2013. The shares are up 4.3 percent in 2012. Of the 500 companies in the index, 245 have price-earnings ratios below their five-year means, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That’s up from 196 at this time last year and 174 two years ago, the data show. Bull markets “normally finish with a real burst of hyper enthusiasm,” Michael Shaoul, chairman of New York-based Marketfield Asset Management, which oversees 3.5 billion, said in a phone interview. “We haven’t seen the beginning of that yet.

Brought up in the cloistered world of Jordan College, Oxford, she finds herself embroiled in a cosmic war between Lord Asriel on the one side, and the first angel to come into being, called The Authority, and his Regent, called Metatron, on the other. - Philip Pullman CBE, FRSL (born 19 October 1946) is an English writer. He is the author of several best-selling books, most notably the fantasy trilogy \\"His Dark Materials\\" and the fictionalised biography of Jesus, \\"The Good Man Jesus and the Scoundrel Christ\\". In 2008, \\"The Times\\" named Pullman one of the \\"50 greatest British writers since 1945\\". In a 2004 poll for the BBC, Pullman was named the eleventh most influential person in British culture. - Jesus (; c. 4 BC c. AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church. - The Subtle Knife, the second book in the \\"His Dark Materials\\" series, is a young-adult fantasy novel written by Philip Pullman and published in 1997. The novel continues the adventures of Lyra Belacqua as she investigates the mysterious Dust phenomenon and searches for her father.

News article: Aust man held in cells by Thai court A young Australian man who was preparing to give evidence against two students who allegedly beat him brutally at a Thai nightclub last year instead found himself in a police cell and asked to post bail. Jack Hansen-Bartel, 21, was at court on Friday for the first day of a hearing against two Asian-American students accused of the attack on June 10 last year. Mr Hansen-Bartel was required to undergo several operations to treat facial injuries after the attack on the resort island of Samui. The attackers were identified by witnesses as two Asian-American students visiting from an international school in China. Police quickly arrested the students as Mr Hansen-Bartel was taken to hospital, but the pair, both from wealthy families, have reportedly attempted to influence the case. Thailand's Office of the Ombudsman launched an investigation, resulting in the replacement of the public prosecutor overseeing the case amid allegations of irregularities. The two American men and their families were at the Samui Court on Friday to hear charges of serious assault on Mr Hansen-Bartel, but the hearing was postponed and Mr Hansen-Bartel was taken into custody in response to charges filed earlier this year by lawyers representing the two Americans. The lawyers had Mr Hansen-Bartel charged with assaulting the two students without causing them any physical or psychological harm and of disturbing the peace. Mr Hansen-Bartel's mother, Annie Hansen-Bartel, originally from Melbourne, says her son was traumatised after being thrown into cells with hardened criminals. \\"It's really difficult,\\" she told AAP. \\"Jack's a really gentle soul and when I see police ... twisting his arm up his back and throwing him on the floor it's not good.\\" Mr Hansen-Bartel's Melbourne-based brother, Jesse, in a Facebook posting called the jailing of his brother \\"a ploy clearly tactical in nature designed to detract from the severity of the charges against (the Americans)\\". Mr Hansen-Bartel was later released after posting 5000 baht (A200) bail. The American families are reported to have offered an out-of-court settlement but this was rejected by Mr Hansen-Bartel's lawyers. Ms Hansen-Bartel has said the attack on her son was unprovoked and had left the family facing medical and legal bills of more than 180,000. Do you have any news photos or videos? What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"A young Australian man named Jack Hansen-Bartel was attacked at a nightclub in Thailand last year. He was hurt badly, and two students from an international school in China were said to be the attackers. At first, they were arrested, but their families are rich, and there seems to be some strange things happening with the case. When Jack went to the court to speak about what happened, the two students' lawyers said that Jack had attacked them, even though they didn't get hurt. Because of this, the Thai police put Jack in jail. His mother said Jack was very upset and scared, because he was with some really bad people in jail. Jack had to pay some money to get out of jail. Now, the attackers' families are offering to pay Jack some money to stop the court case, but Jack's lawyers are not accepting that. Jack's family had to pay a lot of money for his medical and legal problems, and they say the attack was not Jack's fault."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

You can put it under your pillow and look forward to finding some money there in the morning. And then you can watch your new permanent tooth grow in its place. But if a permanent tooth falls out, that's a problem. There isn't another one under the gum that can replace it. Unfortunately, this happens to some older people. And if permanent teeth fall out-or need to be pulled-an older person might need dentures. Dentures, known as false teeth, are a set of replacement teeth for any teeth that are missing. There are partial dentures, which take the place of only a few teeth and prevent the others from changing position. If all the teeth are gone, the person would need complete dentures, which replace every tooth in the mouth. Dentures can cause pains at first and take little time to get adjusted to. They also need special care. They should be brushed daily with a special denture brush and cleanser and soaked in denture solution when not in the mouth. Dentures are important for older folks because, without teeth, it's hard to smile, talk, and eat properly. But it can be a little _ if you see someone take out his or her dentures. It can also be strange to see someone, like a grandparent, without dentures in because he or she won't have any teeth. Try not to make fun of the person because this could cause hurt feelings. People usually lose their permanent teeth due to periodontal disease, or gum disease, which is caused by bacteria that attacks the gums. Diseased gums aren't strong and healthy, so teeth can get loose and fall out. Older people often have many cavities that have been filled over the years, and these fillings can weaken over time, leading to more tooth decay. Question: If one of your baby teeth falls out, you_. Options: A: should have a false tooth fixed in its place B: have to put it under your pillow at once C: will gain a permanent tooth in future D: can exchange it for some money","completion":"To find the correct answer, let us examine the article and identify the statement that is related to baby teeth falling out: \\"Losing a baby tooth can be fun for a kid.

Let's do this step by step: Initial equation: -890*k = -1060*k - 5950 The first thing we need to do is to get all the k terms on one side of the equation. We can easily do this by adding 1060*k to both sides of the equation. This neutralizes the -1060*k on the right side and gives us a new equation: (-890*k) + (1060*k) = -1060*k - 5950 + 1060*k Which simplifies to: 170*k = -5950 We then want to isolate 'k', which is our variable. We can do this by dividing each side of the equation by 170: (170*k) / 170 = -5950 / 170 Which simplifies to: k = -35 So, the solution to the equation -890*k = -1060*k - 5950 is k = -35."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: The New York Times Schering-Plough and Merck are aided by cost cuts in the fourth quarter, despite declining sales for their shared cholesterol treatments. Zetia and Vytorin are heavily prescribed despite a lack of proof the cholesterol drugs help to prolong life or prevent heart attacks. Schering-Plough says Food and Drug Administration has rejected Bridion, its drug to reverse effects of anesthesia that had been heralded as breakthrough product by analysts and was unanimously recommended by federal advisory panel The cholesterol-lowering drug Vytorin did not help people with heart-valve disease avoid further heart problems but did appear to increase their risk of cancer, scientists reported Monday. Food and Drug Administration is investigating whether four drugs used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and other immune system diseases might increase risk of cancer in children; says it has received reports of 30 cases of cancer over 10 years among children and young adults treated with those drugs; drugs involved are Enbrel, sold by Amgen and Wyeth, Remicade, sold by Johnson & Johnson and, in Europe, by Schering-Plough, Humira, sold by Abbott Laboratories and Cimzia, which is sold by UBC; photo House Democrats are questioning whether Merck and Schering-Plough made up information about a meeting of medical specialists to discuss Vytorin, after lawmakers began investigating a failed study of the drug. Heart experts are surely right that Vytorin and Zetia should be a last resort for patients who can’t get their cholesterol down any other way. A doctor who led a key trial of two heart drugs accused their makers, Merck and Schering-Plough, last July of hiding the negative results. Panel of cardiologists reports that Vytorin and Zetia, two widely prescribed cholesterol-reducing drugs, may not work and should be used only as last resort; says doctors and patients should rely more heavily on older cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins, which have proven benefits and can be cheaper; says other, lesser-known drugs like vitamin niacin should be tried before Vytorin and Zetia; editorial in New England Journal of Medicine makes same recommendation; panel and editorial coinci...

It is composed in the key of E minor using common time and a moderately fast tempo of 140 beats per minute. Instrumentation is provided by strings, horns, a guitar, and a piano, to create what Music Times' Carolyn Menyes described as a \\"crawling beat\\". March Robisch of Thought Catalog described the single as having \\"that ska quality that made No Doubt so successful\\". Digital Spy's Lewis Corner and Amy Davidson wrote that it is a \\"ska-flecked romp of pumped-up foghorns and plodding brass\\". A writer from Capital XTRA described it as having a \\"mellow beat\\", while Rolling Stone's Daniel Sannwald wrote it has a \\"party-vibe production\\".During the track, Stefani's vocal range spans from the low note of D3 to the high note of A4. Williams equated Stefani's tone to that of a \\"child whisperer\\" due to her ability to make music that appeals to children. The lyrics are about Paddington Bear and his travels; Rolling Stone called it \\"a pop-reggae allegory about a bear with an identity crisis\\".

Plot title: Outland Movie plot: In the future, Federal Marshal William O'Niel (Sean Connery) is assigned to a tour of duty at the titanium ore mining outpost Con-Am 27, operated by the company Conglomerates Amalgamated on the Jovian moon of Io. Conditions on Io are difficult: gravity is 1/6 that of Earth's with no breathable atmosphere, spacesuits are cumbersome, and miners carry their own air supply. Shifts are long, but significant bonuses are paid. The outpost's general manager, Mark Sheppard (Peter Boyle), boasts that productivity has broken all previous records since he took over. O'Niel's wife Carol (Kika Markham) feels she cannot raise their son Paul on Io, fleeing with the child to the Jupiter space station to await a shuttle back to Earth. Later, a miner named Tarlow (John Ratzenberger) suffers an attack of stimulant psychosis: he sees spiders and rips open his spacesuit, resulting in his death by explosive decompression. Cane, another miner, enters an elevator without his spacesuit during another psychotic episode, and likewise dies from decompression. With the reluctant assistance of Dr. Lazarus (Frances Sternhagen), O'Niel investigates the deaths. Another incident involves a worker, Sagan, who takes a prostitute hostage and threatens to kill her with a knife. O'Niel attempts to calm the man while Montone (James B. Sikking), his sergeant, sneaks in via the air duct and kills Sagan with a shotgun. O'Niel and Lazarus discover that Sagan had traces of a powerful amphetamine-type drug in his bloodstream, which would allow the miners to work continuously for days at a time, until they \\"burn out\\" and turn psychotic after approximately ten months of use. O'Niel uncovers a drug distribution ring run by a corrupt Sheppard and sanctioned by Montone. Using surveillance cameras, O'Niel finds and captures one of Sheppard's dealers, Nicholas Spota.

My question: How does O'Neil get rid of the hitmen?

Sheppard hires two professional assassins to eliminate O'Niel to stop him from interfering with the drug operation. To get rid of the hitmen, O'Niel utilizes his knowledge of the mining outpost and its technology to his advantage. He first suspects the hitmen's arrival due to the unusual docking of a cargo shuttle and prepares himself by planting explosive charges around the outpost. He also disables some of the outpost's security cameras to create blind spots in the surveillance system. As the hitmen arrive, O'Niel faces them both individually and engages in intense fights. During the battles, O'Niel lures them into the traps he has set. One of the hitmen is killed when O'Niel lures him into an area rigged with explosives, detonating them just as the hitman enters the area. For the second hitman, O'Niel confronts him directly, ultimately overpowering and killing him as well. By using his tactical skills and strategic planning, O'Niel overcomes the odds and successfully eliminates the hitmen sent to kill him."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The NHL salary cap is the total amount of money that National Hockey League teams are allowed to pay their players. It is a \`\`hard'' cap, meaning there are no exemptions (and thus no luxury tax penalties are required). Answer this question, making sure that the answer is supposed by the text: can you go over the salary cap in the nhl?","completion":"Based on the information provided, you cannot go over the salary cap in the NHL. The NHL employs a \\"hard\\" cap, which means that there are no exemptions, unlike in some other sports leagues that have a \\"soft\\" cap with luxury tax penalties for exceeding the cap. The hard cap system ensures that all NHL teams operate under the same financial constraints, promoting competitive balance and preventing wealthier teams from monopolizing talent by outspending their rivals. The NHL salary cap is calculated based on the league's hockey-related revenues, with the aim of maintaining a stable financial environment for both the players and the franchises. Teams must ensure that their total player salaries remain within the limits of the cap, which is adjusted annually to reflect changes in revenues. This financial constraint forces teams to carefully manage their roster and make strategic decisions in order to stay compliant with the cap. There are, however, certain situations where teams may have temporary relief in case of injuries or other unforeseen circumstances. For example, teams can place a player who suffers from a long-term injury on the Long-Term Injured Reserve (LTIR), which allows the team to temporarily exceed the salary cap to replace that player. Nevertheless, once the injured player returns, the team must once again be compliant with the cap. In conclusion, you cannot go over the salary cap in the NHL, as it uses a hard cap system without any exemptions. This system is designed to promote fairness and competitive balance across the league, requiring teams to make strategic decisions when managing their roster and player salaries. Though there may be temporary solutions for unforeseen circumstances like injuries, the overall cap structure remains a key element in maintaining a level playing field in the league."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Given the following context: In 1969, American rock musician Jimi Hendrix, who was then at the height of his career, was arrested, tried, and acquitted in Canada for drug possession. On May 3, 1969, customs agents at Toronto International Airport detained Hendrix after finding a small amount of what they suspected to be heroin and hashish in his luggage. Four hours later, after a mobile lab confirmed what had been found, he was formally charged with drug possession. Released on 10,000 bail, Hendrix was required to return on May 5 for an arraignment hearing. During a performance at Maple Leaf Gardens later that night, he displayed a jovial attitude, joking with the audience and singing a few lines of mock opera for comedic effect. At a preliminary hearing on June 19, Judge Robert Taylor set a date for December 8, at which Hendrix would stand trial for two counts of illegal possession of narcotics, for which he faced as many as 20 years in prison. While there was no question as to whether the drugs were in Hendrix's luggage, in order for the Crown to prove possession they had to show that he knew they were there. In his cross-examination of Canadian customs officials, defense attorney John O'Driscoll raised doubts about whether the narcotics belonged to Hendrix, who had no drug paraphernalia in his luggage or needle tracks on his arms. After a trial that lasted for three days, the jury deliberated for 8 hours before returning a not guilty verdict, acquitting Hendrix of both charges. The incident proved stressful for Hendrix, and it weighed heavily on his mind during the seven months that he awaited trial. Two weeks after the arrest, he told his friend, journalist Sharon Lawrence, that his fear of needles discouraged him from using heroin and that associating with junkies had convinced him it was not a drug he wanted to use. Both of Hendrix's Experience bandmates, Mitch Mitchell and Noel Redding, later stated that they had been warned about a planned drug bust the day before flying to Toronto and they believed that drugs had been planted... answer the following question: What date did Jimi Hendrix play Maple Leaf Gardens?

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"What did Gautama Buddha teach other than Three marks of existence, the Five Aggregates, karma and rebirth, the Four Noble Truths, the Noble Eightfold Path, and nirvana?\\" Context: \\"Pre-sectarian Buddhism is the earliest phase of Buddhism, recognized by nearly all scholars. Its main scriptures are the Vinaya Pitaka and the four principal Nikayas or Agamas. Certain basic teachings appear in many places throughout the early texts, so most scholars conclude that Gautama Buddha must have taught something similar to the Three marks of existence, the Five Aggregates, dependent origination, karma and rebirth, the Four Noble Truths, the Noble Eightfold Path, and nirvana. Some scholars disagree, and have proposed many other theories.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"In addition to the key teachings mentioned in the context, Gautama Buddha taught several other principles and practices that formed an integral part of Pre-sectarian Buddhism. These include: 1. Mindfulness and meditation: Buddha emphasized the importance of mindfulness and meditation in achieving a deeper understanding of oneself and the world. These practices help individuals develop concentration, insight, and mental tranquility, which are essential for spiritual progress. 2. The practice of loving-kindness (Metta): Buddha taught the importance of cultivating loving-kindness towards all sentient beings. This practice fosters compassion, empathy, and understanding, which are essential for personal growth and harmonious relationships with others. 3. The Middle Way: Gautama Buddha advocated for a balanced approach to life, known as the Middle Way. This philosophy emphasizes avoiding extremes of indulgence and self-denial, focusing instead on finding a moderate and balanced path to spiritual development. 4. Morality (Sila): Buddha stressed the importance of ethical conduct as a foundation for spiritual progress. This includes following the Five Precepts, which are basic moral guidelines for Buddhists to live by. These precepts are: abstaining from taking life, stealing, sexual misconduct, false speech, and consuming intoxicants. 5. The practice of generosity (Dana): Buddha encouraged his followers to practice generosity as a means to cultivate letting go of attachment and developing a sense of interconnectedness with others. This can include giving material support to others, offering emotional support, or sharing knowledge. 6. The Six Perfections (Paramitas): In order to progress on the path to enlightenment, practitioners are encouraged to develop six qualities known as the Six Perfections. These are generosity, morality, patience, effort, concentration, and wisdom. By combining these additional teachings with the central doctrines like the Three marks of existence, the Five Aggregates, karma and rebirth, the Four Noble Truths, the Noble Eightfold Path, and nirvana, Gautama Buddha provided a comprehensive spiritual framework for his followers to achieve liberation from suffering."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 2: It's been said that in the coming years, the US's capacity is expected to improve. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. The two sentences provide distinct information about the U.S. capacity. It is important to understand the meaning of each statement and analyze the relationship between them. Sentence 1 provides a specific numerical value of the current capacity in the U.S., stating that it is equal to 465 million pounds per year, or 233,000 tons. This presents a clear and quantifiable understanding of the present situation. Sentence 2, on the other hand, discusses a future expectation that the U.S. capacity will improve in the coming years. This suggests that there will be growth or development in the capacity, but does not provide a specific numerical value or a definite timeline as to when this improvement will occur. As the first sentence provides information about the present capacity, while the second sentence talks about the future expectations, they are not directly related and do not entail each other. The second sentence could be considered as additional information or a prediction, but it does not necessarily follow logically from the first sentence. To better understand the relationship between these two sentences, it would be helpful to have more context, background information, or data that could aid in making a connection between the current capacity and the anticipated improvement in capacity. For example, it would be useful to know if there are any specific projects, policies, or strategies in place aiming at increasing the capacity in the U.S. in the near future.

The Louvin Brothers were an American musical duo composed of brothers Ira Lonnie Loudermilk (1924–1965) and Charlie Elzer Loudermilk (1927–2011), better known as Ira and Charlie Louvin. The brothers are cousins to John D. Loudermilk, a Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame member. Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? They weren't the first artists inducted in the hall of fame in their family","completion":"From the information provided in the paragraph, we can conclude that the Louvin Brothers, Ira and Charlie Louvin, were not the first artists in their family to be inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame. Their cousin, John D. Loudermilk, was a member of the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame, indicating that he was likely inducted before them. The Louvin Brothers started off by singing gospel music in their early career, eventually transitioning to secular country music. They were known for their close harmony vocals, making them an influential act in the history of country music. Their extensive repertoire includes classics like \\"When I Stop Dreaming,\\" \\"I Don't Believe You've Met My Baby,\\" and \\"Cash on the Barrelhead,\\" which showcased their signature harmony style and demonstrated their adept songwriting skills. Despite their significant impact on the country music scene, it is essential to verify the order in which they were inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame compared to their cousin, John D. Loudermilk, to confirm the sentence's accuracy. John D. Loudermilk, a singer and songwriter in his own right, is best known for writing a vast collection of hit songs for many other artists. Some of his renowned compositions include \\"Tobacco Road,\\" \\"Indian Reservation,\\" and \\"A Rose And A Baby Ruth.\\" He had a long and successful career in the music industry, earning him his induction into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1976. The Louvin Brothers were inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2001, a separate entity from the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame. It should be noted that there is a difference between these two honors, and induction into the Country Music Hall of Fame does not necessarily imply induction into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame. However, being inducted into the former is also a prestigious achievement, showcasing the brothers' impact on country music both as performers and songwriters. Considering the information at hand, it could be inferred that the Louvin Brothers were not the first in their family to be inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame, as their cousin, John D. Loudermilk, had been inducted in 1976. Meanwhile, the Louvin Brothers themselves were inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2001, which is an honor that further affirms their contributions to country music and its growth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

At 1.30pm, the five servicemen were flown into RAF Brize Norton, where a private ceremony for close relatives took place. Family members then lined the road on Norton Way, clutching flowers including red and white roses, lilies, brightly coloured tulips and yellow daffodils. The street fell silent at 4.52pm, when the bell tolled to mark the arrival of the servicemen’s families at the Memorial Garden. Flag bearers from military organisations from across the country raised their banners and lowered them as the bell tolled again at 5.15pm, when the hearses drew up. All five families threw flowers on top of the hearses, with some mourners touching the glass and hearses as they wept. Five minutes later, the coffins, draped with Union flags, were then driven to the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford. The crowds loudly applauded as the hearses drew away to the peal of bells.

'They were fine ambassadors for their unit and for defence as a whole, and we shall not forget them.' Capt. Clarke, 30, from Cowbridge, South Wales, was a pilot and 'rising star' in the AAC who was 'full of life and immensely committed to his soldiers. and friends'. WO.

Known as Rak to his comrades, he was said to be 'charming, funny and sharp as a tack'. L/Cpl Thomas, 26, from Brecon in Powys, Mid Wales, had volunteered for deployment to Afghanistan and arrived there in December last year. His family described him as a 'truly amazing person, living his life to the full, while fulfilling some of his many dreams and adventures'. The helicopter in which the men were travelling is believed to have been from AAC 657 Squadron, a top unit based at RAF Odiham which provides support and transport for special forces troops. The aircraft went down in the Takhta Pul district of Kandahar, in what was the worst incident involving a British military helicopter in Afghanistan since the war began there in 2001. The crash caused the third biggest single loss of life of British troops since the conflict in Afghanistan began and brought the total number of service personnel killed there to 453.

Background: Precipitation in grasslands is equal to or less than evapotranspiration and causes soil development to operate in relative drought. Leaching and migration of weathering products is therefore decreased. Large amounts of evaporation causes buildup of calcium (Ca) and other large cations flocculate clay minerals and fulvic acids in the upper soil profile. Impermeable clay limits downward percolation of water and fulvic acids, reducing chemical weathering and podzolization. The depth to the maximum concentration of clay increases in areas of increased precipitation and leaching. When leaching is decreased, the Ca precipitates as calcite (CaCO3) in the lower soil levels, a layer known as caliche. Paragraph: Two farmers had neighboring parcels of land. Bob had a nice parcel of old growth forest, while the other farmer, named Bill , had a similar sized parcel covered in grasslands. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which farmer observed a greater buildup of calcium in the soil? Answer:","completion":"Based on the provided information, Bill, the farmer with the grasslands, would likely observe a greater buildup of calcium in the soil. This is because in grasslands, precipitation is equal to or less than evapotranspiration, which causes the soil to develop in relative drought conditions. These conditions lead to decreased leaching and migration of weathering products, such as calcium. This, in turn, results in a buildup of calcium and other large cations in the upper soil profile. Furthermore, when leaching is decreased, calcium can precipitate as calcite (CaCO3) in the lower soil levels, forming a caliche layer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer: The animal found with 17,000-year-old damage from tuberculosis is a bison, specifically discovered in Wyoming, USA. This evidence involves the earliest unambiguous detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacterium responsible for causing tuberculosis. The 17,000-year-old bison remains not only provide insights into the history of tuberculosis but also shed light on its evolutionary origins and transmission between species. Paleontological and molecular studies on the bison's remains led to the identification of tuberculosis-inflicted lesions on its bones. This finding suggests that tuberculosis has been present in the animal kingdom for an extended period, and the disease has evolved and adapted over thousands of years. Additionally, the presence of tuberculosis in a wild animal such as the bison implies that the bacterium could have been transmitted between different species through natural processes like inhalation, ingestion, or contact with infected bodily fluids. Furthermore, the discovery of tuberculosis in the ancient bison contributes to the understanding of the history and evolution of this disease in both humans and animals. Ancient human remains have also exhibited signs of tuberculosis, with some dating back to around 9,000 years ago. These findings indicate that the disease has affected various creatures, including wild animals, domesticated animals, and humans, throughout history. In conclusion, the animal found with 17,000-year-old damage from tuberculosis is a bison from Wyoming. This discovery provides significant evidence of the earliest unambiguous detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and important information about the disease's evolution and transmission across species. It is an invaluable contribution to the understanding of tuberculosis and offers a historical context for ongoing research and efforts to eradicate the disease."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which books do you suggest? How do I improve my English writing ability? Pick from: 1). no. 2). yes. The answer is:","completion":"2). yes. While the two questions may appear slightly different at first glance, they both fundamentally ask the same thing: how to improve one's English writing skills. Both questions inquire about methods or resources to enhance the individual's ability to write in English effectively. Let's explore these questions in more depth and provide some suggestions to address the concern. First and foremost, it is essential to practice writing in English consistently. Regular practice helps you become familiar with the language structure, vocabulary, and allows you to identify your strengths and weaknesses. Set a goal for daily or weekly writing practice, and try to stick to it. You can write journal entries, blog posts, or even engage in creative writing exercises. Next, expand your vocabulary by reading a variety of English materials, such as news articles, books, essays, and magazines. This will help you become familiar with different writing styles, tone, and usage of words and phrases. Some recommended books to improve your English writing skills are: 1. \\"The Elements of Style\\" by William Strunk Jr. and E.B. White 2. \\"On Writing Well\\" by William Zinsser 3. \\"The Sense of Style\\" by Steven Pinker 4. \\"Eats, Shoots & Leaves\\" by Lynne Truss 5. \\"Bird by Bird\\" by Anne Lamott It is also crucial to learn and understand the basic grammar rules and sentence structure in English.

That possibility has been created by the discovery of a new class of insect repellant made in the laboratory of Vanderbilt Professor of Biological Sciences and Pharmacology Laurence Zwiebel and reported this week in the online Early Edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. \\"It wasn't something we set out to find,\\" said David Rinker, a graduate student who performed the study in collaboration with graduate student Gregory Pask and post-doctoral fellow Patrick Jones. \\"It was an anomaly that we noticed in our tests.\\" The tests were conducted as part of a major interdisciplinary research project to develop new ways to control the spread of malaria by disrupting a mosquito's sense of smell supported by the Grand Challenges in Global Health Initiative funded by the Foundation for the NIH through a grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. \\"It's too soon to determine whether this specific compound can act as the basis of a commercial product,\\" Zwiebel cautioned. \\"But it is the first of its kind and, as such, can be used to develop other similar compounds that have characteristics appropriate for commercialization.\\" The discovery of this new class of repellant is based on insights that scientists have gained about the basic nature of the insect's sense of smell in the last few years. Although the mosquito's olfactory system is housed in its antennae, 10 years ago biologists thought that it worked in the same way at the molecular level as it does in mammals. A family of special proteins called odorant receptors, or ORs, sits on the surface of nerve cells in the nose of mammals and in the antennae of mosquitoes. When these receptors come into contact with smelly molecules, they trigger the nerves signaling the detection of specific odors. In the last few years, however, scientists have been surprised to learn that the olfactory system of mosquitoes and other insects is fundamentally different. In the insect system, conventional ORs do not act autonomously. Instead, they form a complex with a unique co-receptor (called Orco) that is also required to detect odorant molecules. ORs are spread all over the antennae and each responds to a different odor. To function, however, each OR must be connected to an Orco. \\"Think of an OR as a microphone that can detect a single frequency,\\" Zwiebel said. \\"On her antenna the mosquito has dozens of types of these microphones, each tuned to a specific frequency. Orco acts as the switch in each microphone that tells the brain when there is a signal. When a mosquito smells an odor, the microphone tuned to that smell will turn \\"on\\" its Orco switch. The other microphones remain off. However, by stimulating Orco directly we can turn them all on at once. This would effectively overload the mosquito's sense of smell and shut down her ability to find blood.\\" Because the researchers couldn't predict what chemicals might modulate OR-Orco complexes, they decided to \\"throw the kitchen sink\\" at the problem. Through their affiliation with Vanderbilt's Institute of Chemical Biology, they gained access to Vanderbilt's high throughput screening facility, a technology intended for the drug discovery process, not for the screening of insect ORs. Jones used genetic engineering techniques to insert mosquito odorant receptors into the human embryonic kidney cells used in the screening process. Rinker tested these cells against a commercial library of 118,000 small molecules normally used in drug development. They expected to find, and did find, a number of compounds that triggered a response in the conventional mosquito ORs they were screening, but they were surprised to find one compound that consistently triggered OR-Orco complexes, leading them to conclude that they had discovered the first molecule that directly stimulates the Orco co-receptor. They have named the compound VUAA1. Although it is not an odorant molecule, the researchers determined that VUAA1 activates insect OR-Orco complexes in a manner similar to a typical odorant molecule. Jones also verified that mosquitoes respond to exposure to VUAA1, a crucial step in demonstrating that VUAA1 can affect a mosquito's behavior. \\"If a compound like VUAA1 can activate every mosquito OR at once, then it could overwhelm the insect's sense of smell, creating a repellant effect akin to stepping onto an elevator with someone wearing too much perfume, except this would be far worse for the mosquito,\\" Jones said. The researchers have just begun behavioral studies with the compound. In preliminary tests with mosquitoes, they have found that VUAA1 is thousands of times more effective than DEET. They have also established that the compound stimulates the OR-Orco complexes of flies, moths and ants. As a result, \\"VUAA1 opens the door for the development of an entirely new class of agents, which could be used not only to disrupt disease vectors, but also the nuisance insects in your backyard or the agricultural pests in your crops,\\" Jones said. Many questions must be answered before VUAA1 can be considered for commercial applications. Zwiebel's team is currently working with researchers in Vanderbilt's Drug Discovery Program to pare away the parts of VUAA1 that don't contribute to its activity. Once that is done, they will begin testing its toxicity. Vanderbilt University has filed for a patent on this class of compounds and is talking with potential corporate licensees interested in incorporating them into commercial products, with special focus on development of products to reduce the spread of malaria in the developing world. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"Researchers at Vanderbilt University have discovered a new class of insect repellent that is thousands of times more effective than DEET, the active ingredient in most commercial mosquito repellents.

This is evident in the provided paragraph, which states that \\"All atoms have the same number of electrons as protons.\\" Atoms are the building blocks of matter and are composed of three main types of particles: electrons, protons, and neutrons. Electrons are negatively charged particles (-1 electric charge) that orbit the nucleus of the atom. In contrast, protons are positively charged particles (+1 electric charge) and are found within the nucleus, along with neutrons, which have no charge. The number of electrons and protons determines the atomic number and chemical properties of an atom. The atomic number is the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom, and it also equals the number of electrons surrounding the nucleus in a neutral atom. The balance between the negatively charged electrons and positively charged protons is what gives an atom its overall neutral charge. In the context of the provided paragraph and given options, the correct answer is that all atoms have equal numbers of electrons and protons. Other options such as nuclei and neutrons, photons and protons, or electrons and neutrons are not correct in this context.

If \\"A woman in a restaurant talking.\\", does it logically follow that \\"A woman is ordering food.\\"?","completion":"The statement \\"A woman in a restaurant talking\\" simply provides a scene: there is a woman in a restaurant having a conversation. By itself, it does not provide enough information to determine the subject of her conversation or her actions. To state that \\"A woman is ordering food\\" as a logical follow-up, we would require more information or context to connect the two statements accurately. For instance, if we had additional information such as \\"A woman in a restaurant talking to a waiter\\" or \\"A woman in a restaurant looking at the menu and discussing her preferences,\\" it would be more reasonable to infer that she might be ordering food. However, there are many potential reasons for a woman to be talking in a restaurant. She could be engaged in a variety of conversations or activities unrelated to food ordering, such as: 1. Discussing business with a colleague. 2. Having a casual conversation with a friend or family member. 3. Talking to a restaurant staff member regarding her reservation, dietary restrictions, or other inquiries. 4. Speaking with the restaurant manager about a concern, compliment, or complaint. 5. Engaging in a phone call or participating in an online meeting. Additionally, considering the fact that restaurants can host various events or gatherings, a woman could be talking during a celebration, announcement, or presentation. In these cases as well, it would not automatically imply that she is ordering food.

Movie plot title: Imprint Movie plot: Christopher (Billy Drago), a Victorian era American journalist, is traveling through Japan looking for Komomo (Itô), a lost girlfriend whom he had promised to rescue from prostitution and bring to America. He travels by boat with several handfarms (Shihô Harumi, Magy, Shin'ichi Tokuhara and Takao Handa). The boat hits something, but it's not a rock - it's the dead body of a woman (Miyuki Konno). The boatman (Hiroshi Kuze) says that the body weighs a ton, so he deduces she was pregnant. When he turns her over, we can see that she was heavily pregnant. Finally landing on an island populated solely by whores and their masters, he is solicited by a syphilitic tout (Yamada). She claims no knowledge of Komomo (Michié), but Christopher has to spend the night, requesting the company of a girl (Youki Kudoh) lurking back in the shadows, who joins him in his room.Disfigured and disturbed, the girl claims a closer connection with the dead than the living. She tells him that Komomo was there, but hanged herself after her love never came for her. Distraught, Christopher seeks solace in sake. Falling asleep, he requests a bedtime story. The girl recounts her past her mother, a midwife, was forced to sell her to a brothel after her father died, and eventually she wound up on the island. Komomo was the most popular girl there, making the others jealous. When the Madam's jade ring was stolen, Komomo was tortured to confess. After suffering hideously underarms burned, needles driven under fingernails and into gums she killed herself in shame and torment.Christopher refuses to believe the girl's story, and he pleads for the whole truth. The girl starts again, in the second telling, her family is no longer happy nor loving; her father was an alcoholic, her mother an abortionist. She was taken in by a Buddhist priest, who, presumably, molested her and inspired an obsession with hell. Her father never died of lung disease she beat him to death for raping her. Again she tells of being sold into prostitution, but gives a new version... Answer:","completion":"The dead body in the movie \\"Imprint\\" weighs so much because the woman was heavily pregnant.

How is chocolate made?","completion":"No, the two questions are not the same, as they address different aspects of the chocolate-making process. Let me explain the difference between the two questions and provide detailed information for each. Question 1: How are chocolate raw materials obtained and how is chocolate made? This question is asking for information about two distinct stages in the chocolate-making process. First, it looks at how the raw materials for chocolate are obtained, and secondly, it delves into the actual process of making chocolate. 1. Obtaining raw materials: The primary raw material for making chocolate is the cacao bean, which is the seed of the cacao tree (Theobroma cacao). Cacao trees are grown in tropical regions, with the majority of production taking place in West Africa, Central and South America, and Southeast Asia. Here is the process of obtaining raw materials for chocolate: a. Harvesting: Cacao pods, which contain cacao beans, are harvested by hand from the cacao tree. This is usually done twice a year during the main and mid-crop harvests. b. Fermentation: The cacao beans are removed from the pods and placed in fermentation boxes or heaps, covered with banana leaves. The fermentation process, which usually takes about five to seven days, is vital for developing the chocolate's flavor profile. c. Drying: After fermentation, the beans are spread out on drying racks or platforms and left to dry in the sun. The drying process ensures that the beans do not mold or rot. It can take up to a week for the cacao beans to dry, after which they are inspected and sorted. d. Roasting: Once the cacao beans have been dried and cleaned, they are roasted to bring out the characteristic chocolate flavor. Roasting temperatures and times vary, depending on the desired flavor profile. 2. Making chocolate: The process of making chocolate involves several steps that transform the prepared cacao beans into a delicious final product. a. Grinding: Roasted cacao beans are ground into a paste called chocolate liquor. The grinding process generates heat, which melts the cocoa butter present in the beans, resulting in a smooth liquid. b. Separation: The chocolate liquor is further processed using pressing machines to separate the cocoa solids from the cocoa butter. This separation results in two products: cocoa powder and cocoa butter. c. Conching: Chocolate makers then mix cocoa butter, cocoa powder, and other ingredients such as sugar, milk powder (for milk chocolate), and vanilla, in a conching machine. This machine refines the texture and flavor of the chocolate, resulting in a smoother product. d. Tempering: The chocolate mixture is then tempered, which involves heating and cooling it to specific temperatures. This process ensures that the chocolate forms the right crystal structure, giving it a shiny appearance and a nice snap when broken. e. Molding: Finally, the tempered chocolate is poured into molds, where it cools and hardens into the desired shape. The chocolate can also be made into various products like chocolate bars, truffles, or confections. Question 2: How is chocolate made? This question only asks for information about the process of making chocolate, starting from the point where the raw materials have already been obtained. In this case, you can focus solely on the steps mentioned in the \\"making chocolate\\" section above (Steps 2a-2e). In summary, while the first question is looking for comprehensive information about the entire chocolate production process from raw material sourcing to the final product, the second question is focused on the specific steps involved in making chocolate from the obtained raw materials."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Determine the sentiment: Notice that all those that did not like and enjoy this film commented that it was not as good as the book or that it differed from the book. I don't understand this type of criticism. Books and films are different media. While books have hours and hours to develop characters and story lines, films have about 120 minutes. Yet the film has the advantage of stimulating several senses: visual, audio, as well as the imagination. I don't care if a film is as good as or, in fact, has any resemblance to the book on which it is based. Who cares? I judge it for what it is. This TV movie was charming. An old and oft-seen story, prone to cliché, it could easily have been embarrassing. However, Riffen and Reeves pull it off. One reviewer found Riffen far to old. I would never have guessed she was 40 when she made this film. It is to her credit as an actress that she played a 23-24 year old amazingly well. I also think it is about the best thing Reeves ever did. The story could have been stronger, and I agree the screen play could have used \\"tightening.\\" Nonetheless, it is well worth watching; clearly not a powerful love story, but rather, a charming romance which will leave you satisfied that love is a strong emotion and good overcomes evil. And it is nice to see a \\"love story\\" without the obligatory f#% word, the naked buttocks, or hours of spit-swapping kissing. Lastly, the musical score is excellent.","completion":"The sentiment of this passage is predominantly positive. The writer states that they don't understand the criticism of comparing a film to its book counterpart, implying that they don't hold such a view themselves. They appreciate that books and films are different media and should be judged individually. They describe the TV movie as \\"charming\\" and praise the acting, particularly Riffen's ability to play a younger character convincingly. Although the writer acknowledges that the story could have been stronger and the screenplay could have been tighter, they still highlight the positive aspects of the film. They express their satisfaction with the romance as it presents love as a strong emotion and that good triumphs over evil. Moreover, they appreciate the absence of explicit content and the focus on the love story instead. In conclusion, the author's sentiment towards the movie is positive, emphasizing the charming aspects of the film while acknowledging some areas that could be improved. They also compliment the musical score, further reinforcing their positive sentiment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Losing weight overall can cut down on belly fat, and make your hips look bigger. To lose weight, the first step is a healthy diet. Your diet should be primarily plant-based. Fruits, vegetables, and whole grains should make up the bulk of your diet. Go for brown rice over white rice, and whole wheat breads over white varieties. Stick to lean forms of protein, like fish and poultry, and low fat dairy products. For example, go for salmon for dinner instead of steak. Sugar can contribute to weight gain overall, so look into cutting back on sugar in your diet. Sugary beverages can be a big culprit, as many people fail to think about liquid calories in their diet. Avoid sugary beverages like soda, specialty latte drinks, and alcoholic beverages including cocktails, wine, beer, and wine coolers. Drink plenty of water instead and opt for unsweetened beverages like unsweetened iced tea and club soda. You can even flavor water and other zero calorie beverages with lemon or lime juice. Read labels before making a purchase. Sugar is found in surprising places, like breads, yogurts, and pasta sauces. You should also look for words like fructose, dextrose, and maltose in the ingredients list. These are all names of added sugar. For women, strive to limit added sugar to 24 grams a day, which is about 6 teaspoons. For men, limit added sugar to 36 grams, which is about 9 teaspoons. Many times, you are eating more calories than you realize. Portion sizes, especially when eating out, can be quite large. Be conscientious of portion size. Try to avoid going out to eat. When you do, split an entree with a friend to halve the calories. If a restaurant has a special menu of low calorie foods, try ordering off of that. Be aware of how much food you should eat at home. One serving of carbohydrates is about the size of a hockey puck. An ounce of dairy is about the size of six dice. A serving of protein should be no bigger than a deck of cards. It can also help to eat slowly. Your body will feel more satisfied, and you will realize you're full quicker. It can be helpful to keep a record of your eating habits, any weight loss you have, and any inches you lose off of your waist. This can help you stay on track and see what days of the week you're likely to slip up. It can also keep you motivated to have a running log of your progress to look at each day. You should also be sure to include other factors that can affect weight loss. For example, note things like your stress level, your sleep schedule, and your daily exercise.

But the fact that such fears are common and normal doesn't mean they can be taken lightly. Kids experience fears and phobias much more strongly than adults. And the influence of the fear can be physical as well as psychological . It can build up so they almost seem scared of everything--a kind of childhood anxiety. Dr. Creswell says: \\"Your child may always seem to expect the worst to happen and lack confidence in his or her ability to deal with any challenge.\\" So don't make the same old mistake of treating them as if they're silly for being a\\"scaredy cat\\". Handling the fears is essential. Children can be born nervous and, if you have such a baby, you'll tend to prevent them from getting worried. So if they fear dogs, you'll keep them away from dogs, but in fact that can just confirm to the child that dogs are scary. What is worse, keeping your child away from what they fear can turn that feeling into a phobia. Instead, you should encourage them to get in touch with the thing they fear, in a safe and supportive environment. Dr. Andy Field, a researcher of childhood fears, says: \\"You shouldn't force, for example, a dog anxious child to go up to a dog. But you can approach it yourself, show them there is nothing to be afraid of, stroke( ) it, and talk about the dog being friendly. Once your child dares to stroke a dog-one that's good with children, of course---then you should encourage them to carry on until they feel calmer, and reward them for'being brave'.\\" Options: A make the same old mistake B overcome them by themselves C experience the worst of things D grow up lacking self-confidence Answer: D grow up lacking self-confidence Question:","completion":"What does Dr. Creswell imply may happen to a child if their fears are not properly addressed and managed?

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the subject of the painting that Hans Hieronymus Imhoff gave a lukewarm description for? , can you please find it? After the painter's death in 1528, the portraits were held by his brother, and then his brother's widow before they passed into the collection of Willibald Imhoff, a grandson of Dürer's friend Willibald Pirckheimer. Inventories from the Imhoff collection from 1573–74, 1580 and 1588 list both panels. The next surviving Imhoff inventory, of 1628, again lists the mother's portrait, but it disappears after mention in the 1633–58 account books of Hans Hieronymus Imhoff, after which its whereabouts became unknown. Dürer expert Matthias Mende described the missing portrait of Barbara Holper as \\"among the most severe losses in the Dürer oeuvre\\". In 1977, art historian Lotte Brand Philip proposed that Unknown Woman in a Coif, held by the Germanisches Nationalmuseum in Nuremberg, was the original portrait of Barbara Holper. The Nuremberg panel was previously thought to have originated from a member of Wolgemut's workshop, a Franconian artist in his circle, or the anonymous Mainz painter Master W. B. Brand Philip's attribution was based on striking similarities in composition and its shared tone, theme and size with the father panel at the Uffizi. In both works the sitters are holding rosary beads, and Dürer attentively describes their hands. Both portraits show the sitter in the same pose, against a similarly coloured background. Both are lit from the upper left. The boards are identically cut in width and depth, although 3 cm was removed from the left edge of Barbara's panel. Brand Philip noted the similarities between the panel and Dürer's 1514 charcoal drawing Portrait of the Artist's Mother at the Age of 63. Fedja Anzelewsky agreed with the attribution, noting that both portraits bear, on their reverse, the catalogue number recorded in the Imhoff inventories, as well as \\"precisely the same design of masses of dark clouds\\".Anzelewsky speculated that the father's portrait, which was not listed in the 1628 Imhoff inventory, had been broken off and sold to Rudolph II of Austria.

Article:","completion":"Title: A Comprehensive Guide to Preparing for Your Move-out Inspection: Practical Tips for a Smooth Transition Introduction Moving out of a rented apartment can be an overwhelming task, especially when dealing with the pressure of ensuring that your living space is clean, undamaged and fit for the next tenant. Navigating the move-out process can be time-consuming, but a little planning and organization can help you avoid unpleasant surprises and additional charges. In this article, we will discuss practical tips on how to prepare for your move-out inspection effectively and ensure a smooth transition to your new home. Step 1: Review the Move-out Policy in Your Lease Before you start planning your move, it's crucial to review the move-out policy outlined in your lease agreement. The lease is a legally binding document that specifies your responsibilities as a tenant and the expectations of your landlord at the end of your tenancy. Carefully read through the policy to understand aspects like: - Notice period: the time frame within which you should inform your landlord about your intention to move out - Cleaning requirements: details about the expected level of cleanliness in the apartment - Repair responsibilities: the extent of your liability for any damages or repairs that might be required - Inspection timeline: when the move-out inspection will be conducted and how much notice will be given. Being informed about these crucial points will provide you with a clear picture of your obligations and help you in planning your move efficiently. Step 2: Examine Your Apartment for Dirt Now that you have reviewed your move-out policy, it's time to thoroughly examine your apartment for cleanliness. Remember that leaving a rental unit in pristine condition is not only crucial for getting your security deposit back but is also the best practice for fostering a positive relationship with your landlord. Pay attention to the following areas: - Walls: Check for stains, scuffs and marks on walls and baseboards and clean them using appropriate cleaning materials - Floors: Vacuum the carpets, sweep and mop the floors, ensuring all dirt, stains and crumbs are removed - Kitchen: Clean the countertops, empty and clean the cabinets and shelves, and scrub the sink - Bathroom: Remove any mold, mildew or soap scum, clean the toilet, bathtub, shower and sink, and sanitize the floor - Windows: Clean the glass, window sills and window tracks. Step 3: Examine Your Apartment for Damage After addressing the cleaning aspect, conduct a thorough examination of your apartment for any damages. Look for issues like chipped paint, broken fixtures, damaged appliances or cracked tiles that might have occurred during your tenancy. If you find any damage, make a list and take photos for your records. You should also consult your lease to determine whether you are responsible for repairing the damages or if it falls under your landlord's responsibilities. Step 4: Ensure Your Appliances Are Functioning Properly During your tenure in the apartment, appliances may experience wear and tear or malfunction. Before moving out, confirm that all the appliances provided by your landlord are in good working condition. This includes checking the refrigerator, oven, washer, dryer, dishwasher and any other appliances that might be part of your rental agreement. If you identify any issues, repair them yourself or talk to your landlord to determine the best course of action. Step 5: Talk to Your Landlord About Any Damage or Problems Once you have inspected your apartment and identified any possible problems or damages, it's essential to communicate your findings with your landlord. Transparent communication will allow both parties to discuss amicable solutions and prevent misunderstandings. Provide them with copies of any photos or documentation that you have taken during your inspection and explain the nature of the problem. Your landlord will appreciate your honesty and proactive approach, which will go a long way in ensuring a smooth move-out process. Conclusion Preparing for a move-out inspection is a crucial aspect of transitioning from one apartment to another. By reviewing your lease, conducting thorough checks for dirt and damages, ensuring appliances are functioning properly, and maintaining open communication with your landlord, you will pave the way for a positive and stress-free moving experience."},{"prompt":"Extract the answer to the question from the following context.

As the nation continues to grieve for the six adults and 20 children taken too soon in the Newtown, Connecticut, school shooting, a hero from another generation has slipped peacefully into the pages of history. There were many who knew Sen. Dan Inouye, a Democrat and Medal of Honor recipient from Hawaii who passed away Monday, better than we did. But we had the good fortune of sitting with him this past summer, interviewing him and hearing some of the remarkable stories from his life in America's service. The portrait that emerged was that of a man of courage, character, and, perhaps above all, a singular spirit of peace and good will that was forged, paradoxically, amid some of the most horrendous carnage of the Second World War. News: Hawaii's Daniel Inouye, Senate's second longest-serving member, dead at 88. Some of Inouye's deeds -- his valor serving on the German front in one of America's most decorated (and heavily wounded) units, his Herculean political efforts on behalf of his home state -- have been well remarked. What we were especially struck by was his quiet, sagelike humanity. There was his story, for example, of the day during the war when he came upon a German soldier who appeared to be preparing to kill him. The German, as Inouye told it, put his hand into his shirt, and Inouye, thinking he was reaching for his weapon, \\"smashed him in the face.\\" As the man hit the ground, his hand fell out of his shirt, revealing photographs -- the soldier's wife, his kids. \\"So help me, up until that moment, I looked upon Germans as enemies, period,\\" said Inouye, who had by then killed many enemy soldiers already. \\"From that moment, I looked upon him as a father, son, uncle, boyfriend. He was human. And it's not easy to kill.\\" It was, he said, what he always told people when they expressed disbelief that he, a decorated veteran, could stand up against the war in Iraq. \\"You've got to convince me before we go to war,\\" he maintained. \\"You would never forget running over a dog -- the bump. If you don't forget that, how can you forget killing a human being?\\" To hear Inouye talk was to sit beside a still, fathomless pool -- he spoke with a measured calm and wisdom that made clear how deep the dignity beneath it ran. In that way, he called to mind an echo of former Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield -- of whom, Inouye said, \\"If there was a mentor, it was him.\\" And he carried Mansfield's stoic ability to forge consensus and compromise with him, far into a legislative era known for its strident opposites. Of his 12 subcommittees, Inouye told us in July, \\"Nine of them have reported out their bills almost unanimously. About six were unanimous -- 30-0. The others were 29-1, 28-2. ... That's this month. It can be done! ... And 30-0 includes (Senate Minority Leader Mitch) McConnell!\\" His secret was deceptively straightforward: a steady practice of simple gestures -- sitting with senators who had objections, calling a senior Republican \\"vice chairman\\" instead of \\"ranking member\\" (\\"I hate that word 'ranking' -- it's something like 'stink'!\\"), not speaking ill of anyone to the press. \\"It might take some patience, but when I found out that you were pissed about (a) program, I'd sit down with you and talk about it,\\" he told us. \\"Little things like that make a difference.\\" It was a basic humanity and a largeness of vision that Inouye extended to individuals from all backgrounds, born not only out of his experiences seeing his own people -- Japanese-Americans -- vilified and interned during World War II (Inouye himself signed up as soon as the U.S. government lifted its ban on American-born Japanese enlistments), but from his own crucibles in the war. Describing the injury that cost him his right arm and very nearly his life, Inouye told us of being taken to the Army hospital, of being initially counted a hopeless case, of having his arm amputated without anesthesia, of ultimately receiving 17 blood transfusions to stay alive. Of those 17 transfusions, he explained:. \\"That made a little difference in my outlook on life. In our last battle, the regiment was attached to the 92nd Division -- all African-American. Hospitals were run by the 92nd Division, and in those days, I don't know about the other hospitals, but in the one I was in, (the blood) came in a glass bottle, with tape -- donated by so and so, private, 92nd Division. So you know he's African-American. Well I got 17 pints. \\"If it weren't for (the 92nd), I wouldn't be here. The war did a lot to change your ideas. I looked upon (people of color), as I do today, as brothers. What else can I do? After all, I've got the same blood.\\" Throughout its history, the nation has been blessed to have men like Inouye -- reserved, unboastful men, whose actions show the deep reservoir of quiet honor from which they draw their strength. Who show the courage that Hemingway called \\"grace under pressure.\\" When he was first brought to the Army field hospital after sustaining the wounds that would claim his arm, Inouye related, \\"The doctors looked at me; they're mumbling among themselves,\\" he recalled. \\"Two minutes later a chaplain comes up -- opening words: 'God loves you.' \\"I said: 'I know that. I love him too,\\" he recounted with a chuckle. \\"'But I'm not ready to meet him yet!'\\" No one can know the ways of the Lord, but we would be surprised if he wasn't happy to meet Dan Inouye today. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael Zuckerman and David Gergen. Write highlights for this article.","completion":"The passing of Sen. Dan Inouye, a Democrat and Medal of Honor recipient from Hawaii, marks the loss of a hero from a different generation. His actions during World War II and his political efforts on behalf of his state are well-known, but his quiet, sagelike humanity made him a powerful presence. He was able to forge consensus and compromise in a divisive legislative environment, extending basic humanity and largeness of vision to people from all backgrounds. The courage, resilience, and dignity that Sen. Inouye displayed throughout his life is a testament to the quiet honor from which he drew his strength, and his memory leaves a lasting impact on the hearts of many."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Given the background: The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100. and the situation: Two identical planets, Norlon and Bothar, have been discovered in a neighboring galaxy of ours. These two planets have the same type of atmosphere as Earth and are extremely similar to Earth in terms of topography and even species of animals that live on them. The main difference is that Norlon is inhabited by a species very similar to humans that emit a lot of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Bothar, however, has no such species on its planet.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Hillary Clinton said to consider delay of 2016 campaign announcement Hillary Rodham Clinton (Jack Gruber, USA TODAY) Hillary Rodham Clinton may be pushing off the formal announcement of her likely presidential campaign to sometime this summer. Politico reports the former secretary of State “is strongly considering delaying the formal launch” of her campaign from April until July. The story cites unnamed Democrats and advisers. A Democrat familiar with Clinton’s thinking said: ‘She doesn’t feel under any pressure, and they see no primary challenge on the horizon. If you have the luxury of time, you take it.’ The 2016 presidential race seems to have gotten underway already, with several potential candidates in early stages of organizing. But none of the major candidates has officially launched a 2016 campaign. Republicans Jeb Bush, Chris Christie and Scott Walker have created committees that would assist in fundraising and serve as vehicles to promote their ideas. Mitt Romney, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Rick Perry are among the Republicans who have brought on staff in anticipation of White House bids. On the Democratic side, Jim Webb announced the formation of a presidential exploratory committee. But the former Virginia senator is considered a long shot for the nomination, with early public opinion polls all showing Clinton far ahead of any potential Democratic rivals. By way of comparison, President Obama formally launched his re-election drive in April 2011 by sending an e-mail to supporters and posting a video on a campaign website. Romney did his official kick-off in June 2011, with a speech before supporters in New Hampshire. For her first presidential race, Clinton announced she was “in to win” with a message posted January 2007 on her website.

Question: Given the background: During late adulthood, the risk of developing diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer continues to rise. Most people also have a decline in strength and stamina. Their senses may start failing, and their reflex time typically increases. Their immune system also doesn’t work as well as it used to. As a result, common diseases like the flu may become more serious and even lead to death. The majority of late adults develop arthritis, and as many as one in four develop Alzheimer’s disease. and the situation: Dr. Jones studied 2 groups of people to see the effects of aging on humans. Group A had people under 35 years old in it, while group B had people over 65. Answer the following question: Which group had a smaller chance of developing cardiovascular diseases? Answer:","completion":"Based on the background information provided, it can be concluded that Group A, which consists of people under 35 years old, has a smaller chance of developing cardiovascular diseases as compared to Group B, comprising of people over 65 years old. During late adulthood, individuals experience an increased risk of developing various health issues, including cardiovascular diseases and cancer. As people age, their bodily functions tend to decline, including strength, stamina, immune system efficiency, and sensory perceptions. These declines contribute to a higher susceptibility to various illnesses, with common diseases like the flu potentially becoming more serious and life-threatening. In contrast, younger individuals, such as those in Group A, have stronger immune systems, better physical strength and capacity, and are generally healthier in various aspects. Consequently, they are at a lower risk for developing cardiovascular diseases in comparison to their older counterparts in Group B. Furthermore, older adults like those in Group B are more likely to develop conditions such as arthritis and Alzheimer's disease. This information further emphasizes the differences in the general health status of the two age groups being studied by Dr. Jones.

A group of model-caliber San Francisco women who have been friends since elementary school are suddenly being threatened and attacked by someone sending them bizarre Valentine's Day cards. Who is the killer and why is the killer after them? My rating will often change on subsequent viewings of a film--sometimes slightly up, sometimes slightly down. However, I can't remember another film where my rating has changed as drastically as it has for Valentine. The first time I watched it, upon its theatrical release, I thought it was pretty awful--I gave it a 4 out of 10, the equivalent of an \\"F\\" letter grade. Watching it for a second time last night, I can't remember what the heck I didn't like about it. I can only assume that maybe I was really in the wrong mood to watch it, or maybe I just didn't get it. In any event, I loved it this time, giving it a 9 out of 10, or an \\"A\\". It might sound ridiculous saying I didn't get a film like this, but there is something to get. Valentine is almost a comedy/horror. Director Jamie Blanks, who was also responsible for 1998's Urban Legend, takes the stereotypical teen horror formula that became so popular in the late 1990s in the wake of Scream (1996) and pushes most of the elements up a notch, making Valentine intentionally cheesy/campy almost to the point of absurdity (where absurdism is a positive stylistic term). On top of that, he gives us a film imbued with humorous commentary on romantic relationships. The humor is unusual in that it has the same exaggeratedly campy tone as the teen horror aspects. Most of the situations in the film, and the modus operandi of the villain, humorous or not, are tied in to the Valentine's Day theme. Many viewers will likely subtract points from the film for its various cliché-rooted but implausible scenarios and plot developments. However, in light of the above, the film is intentionally clichéd, implausible and ludicrous. It's as if Blanks is attempting (and mostly succeeding) to transcend the typical teen slasher by mocking/spoofing the conventions of the genre while also satirizing eros. That's the attraction to the irony of basing a horror film on Valentine's Day. It's an incongruity that is cleverly woven throughout the film, and that is itself at the heart of the slasher genre, making it prime fodder for Valentine's extravagant lampooning. Scream had a similar aim with its horror material, but the twist there was that the film was \\"self-aware\\". Valentine's Day is intentionally not self-aware; the viewer has to rely on contextual clues for satire. Lest some think I'm \\"reading too much\\" into the film, it's worthwhile to note that Blanks said in interviews that he \\"didn't want to just do another slasher film after Urban Legend\\" and producer Dylan Sellers said he wanted to do something \\"more adult\\". Other viewers may dislike the fact that Valentine's Day differs so much from its putative source material, the novel of the same name by Tom Savage. The novel's characters, setting and plot are very different from the film. Sellers has said, \\"While it was a fine book, I didn't think it was the right story for a film\\". So instead the novel, which is much dryer and more serious in tone, was used as a launching pad, a motif to create variations on for a horror/thriller story centered on Valentine's Day. While those facts won't help purists familiar with the book like the film, it's helpful to understand why the film has its divergent plot and attitude. It's probably better to look at the film as an independent entity with a similar theme. Blanks' direction is impeccable visually. Valentine's Day has a lush look throughout, with complex, deep colors, interesting sets, and good staging. Blanks is admirable for keeping his villain and attack scenes not too dark, with clearly conveyed action. He also directs his actors with aplomb, catalyzing often slyly humorous performances. David Boreanaz, as Adam Carr, is involved in many of the funniest moments. While Valentine's Day is no masterpiece, it's a very good horror/thriller film that seems strongly prone to misconceptions. If you watch it expecting something more tongue-in-cheek you may find yourself appreciating it a lot more. Choose your answer. What is the sentiment of this review?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. News article: James Foley’s Brother: The U.S. Could Have Done More for Jim By Liz Goodwin The brother of American journalist James Foley said Friday morning that the U.S. government could have done more to attempt to free his brother and other American hostages from the Islamic militant group ISIL. “There’s more that could have been done directly on Jim’s behalf,” Michael Foley, 38, told Yahoo Global News Anchor Katie Couric in an exclusive interview near his parents’ home in Dover, New Hampshire. “I really, really hope that Jim’s death pushes us to take another look at our approach to terrorist and hostage negotiation.” Foley, a 40-year-old journalist who was covering the Syrian conflict for GlobalPost, was kidnapped nearly two years ago near the Syria-Turkey border. ISIL, also called ISIS, released a grisly video of his beheading Tuesday, claiming it killed him in retaliation for U.S. airstrikes in the region. But another issue was money. The group had also captured French and Spanish journalists, but freed them after their governments paid ransoms through intermediaries. The U.S. government refused to negotiate or pay the group on behalf of Foley and other American captives. ISIL emailed Michael Foley and demanded 100 million euros—a sum he called “ridiculous”—for his brother’s release. “I just feel strongly that more can be done moving forward,” Michael Foley said. The Obama administration said this week that it had sent a special military operations force to try to rescue Foley and the other Americans over the summer, but that the mission failed. “I’d like to think it did happen, but I certainly wasn’t aware of it,” Foley said of the failed mission. ISIL has threatened to kill another captured American journalist, Steven Sotloff, next. Michael Foley said he hopes the U.S. government does more on his behalf, including considering trading prisoners held in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. “I don't believe ISIL can be contained — containment is not a strategy. We need to recognize that they are a threat and we need to deal with them,” Michael Foley said. Michael Foley and his sister Katie, 26, told Couric that condolences have come pouring in from all around the world. Pope Francis called their family yesterday, telling them that James Foley’s death was an act of martyrdom. The family briefly had hope that they would be able to negotiate for his release, after an intermediary made contact with ISIL on their behalf. But then the U.S. government began bombing ISIL earlier this month. On August 12, ISIL sent Foley’s parents a “chilling” email saying their son would die to pay for the airstrikes, according to Michael Foley. “I don’t understand where that type of hate could come from,” Katie Foley said. The family believes that Foley volunteered to be the first American to be executed. “You can see from the clips from the video that he wasn’t afraid,” Michael Foley said. European journalists who were captured by ISIL but later freed told Foley’s family that the journalist made a makeshift board game out of objects they found and even taught his fellow captives Spanish as a way to keep hope alive. The U.S. government says they will hunt down and punish Foley’s killers. “We will be relentless,” President Barack Obama said this week. “When people harm Americans anywhere, we do what’s necessary to see that justice is done.” Foley’s friends have set up a scholarship fund in his name at Marquette University, where he graduated in 1996, for disadvantaged students. Watch the Full Interview: ||||| share tweet pin email James Foley's parents, John and Diane Foley, say that before their son was killed by ISIS they had hoped they could negotiate with the terrorist group, and promise that their son's legacy will live on. \\"Jim's strength and love was the answer to prayer...Jim will live on,\\" the Foleys told TODAY's Tamron Hall Friday.

The group sent Foley's parents an email on Aug. 12, stating that their son would be \\"executed.\\" The email was the first communication the Foleys had received from their son's captors since December of 2013, which initially left them hopeful they could find a way to bring him home safely. Today John and Diane Foley \\"I actually was excited to see an email despite the conclusion that they would execute Jim,'' his father said. \\"We underestimated that point.

We had begged for prayer, but we didn't need to.\\" The family has received a call from Pope Francis comforting them for their loss. \\"Pope Francis was so dear because he is grieving himself having just lost three members of his family and (with) his nephew critically ill,'' Diane said. \\"Here in the midst of his tremendous grief, he took the time to call. He was just so kind.\\" Follow TODAY.com writer Scott Stump on Twitter and Google+. ||||| Somewhere in the desert of eastern Syria, a militant from the Islamic State beheaded the American journalist James Foley this week. The killer and his terrorist group are responsible for Foley’s death. They should be the focus of public anger. But Foley’s execution is also a chilling wake-up call for American and European policymakers, as well as U.S. news outlets and aid organizations. It is the clearest evidence yet of how vastly different responses to kidnappings by U.S. and European governments save European hostages but can doom the Americans. Hostages and their families realize this fully — even if the public does not. “I wish I could have the hope of freedom and seeing my family once again, but that ship has sailed,” Foley said moments before he was killed in a craven video released by the militant group on Tuesday. “I guess, all in all, I wish I wasn’t American.” Foley clearly spoke under duress. But his regret at being an American captive, real or not, reflected grim fact. This spring, four French and two Spanish journalists held hostage by the Islamic State extremists were freed — after the French and Spanish governments paid ransoms through intermediaries. The U.S. government refused to negotiate or pay a ransom in Foley’s case or for any other American captives — including my own abduction by the Taliban five years ago. With the help of an Afghan journalist abducted with me, I was lucky enough to escape. But today Foley is dead and the Islamic State militants now say Steven Sotloff, a journalist for Time magazine whom the group also captured, will be killed if the United States does not stop bombing its fighters in Iraq. There are no easy answers in kidnapping cases. The United States cannot allow terrorist groups to control its foreign policy. One clear lesson that has emerged in recent years, however, is that security threats are more effectively countered by united American and European action. The divergent U.S. and European approach to abductions fails to deter captors or consistently safeguard victims. Last month, a New York Times investigation found that al Qaeda and its direct affiliates had received at least 125 million in revenue from kidnappings since 2008 — primarily from European governments. In the last year alone, they received 66 million. “Kidnapping hostages is an easy spoil,” Nasser al-Wuhayshi, the leader of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, wrote in a 2012 letter to the leader of an al Qaeda affiliate in North Africa, “which I may describe as a profitable trade and a precious treasure.” Publicly, European governments deny making these payments. But former diplomats told the Times that ransoms have been paid through intermediaries. Kidnapping as a fundraising tactic is thriving and rates are going up. In 2003, a ransom of roughly 200,000 was paid for each captive, the newspaper found. Today, captors reap millions per captive. Abductions have become so lucrative that al Qaeda leaders in Pakistan help oversee negotiations for affiliates. Militants groups spread across North Africa, the Middle East and South Asia are now following the same rough protocol. Hostage-taking by extremist groups is now so pervasive that at least one major aid organization is not sending U.S. aid workers to areas where they might be abducted. Instead, they are sending citizens from European countries with governments that will pay ransoms. The cases have taken on a grim pattern: Hostages are abducted, months pass with no news from the captors and a threatening video or email is then sent to families. In some cases, the militants ask that cases not be made public so ransom can be paid quietly. This was the case in Foley’s tortuous, 21-month abduction. For the first 16 months after Foley was taken captive, his family had no information regarding his whereabouts. They learned he was alive from two Spanish journalists who were freed by the Islamic State in March after a ransom was paid. In a subsequent email message, the captors instructed the family to keep the case quiet and not identify the Islamic State as the kidnappers. Fearing for Foley’s life, the family obeyed. Other American families with loved ones taken captive by militants have done the same. Privately, the Foleys and other families have grown intensely frustrated with the failure of American officials to negotiate with the captors. U.S. government officials also refused to coordinate their response in any way with European governments. In the days and weeks ahead, the Foley family will speak for themselves about their ordeal. But the payment of ransoms and abduction of foreigners must emerge from the shadows. It must be publicly debated. American and European policymakers should be forced to answer for their actions. Foley believed that his government would help him, according to his family. In a message that was not made public, Foley said that he believed so strongly that Washington would help that he refused to allow his fellow American captives to not believe in their government. A consistent response to kidnapping by the U.S. and Europe is desperately needed. The current haphazard approach is failing. James Foley must not die in vain.

The shipbuilding industry is a sector that specializes in the design, construction, maintenance, and repair of various types of ships, including commercial, military, and special-purpose vessels. This industry plays a critical role in the global economy by contributing to international trade, defense, and tourism. When discussing the factors that could potentially impact the shipbuilding industry negatively, it is important to consider various economic, political, social, and environmental aspects. 1. Economic factors: The global economy can have a significant impact on the shipbuilding industry. If the world economy experiences a downturn or crisis, this can potentially lead to a reduction in demand for new ships, as well as a decrease in international trade. In turn, this would affect the revenue and profits of the companies operating in this sector. 2. Political factors: Government policies and regulation can also play a significant role in the functioning of the shipbuilding industry. For example, changes in trade policies can impact the demand for vessels, especially if countries impose restrictions on imports or exports. Similarly, fluctuations in defense budgets can affect the demand for military ships. Furthermore, international relations and conflicts can have a negative impact on the climate within which shipbuilding companies operate, potentially leading to decreased trade and increased insecurity. 3. Social factors: Tourism, another important contributor to the shipbuilding industry, can be influenced by social factors such as global pandemics, changing consumer preferences, or other issues that affect people's desire or ability to travel. A decline in tourism can result in reduced demand for passenger vessels, such as cruise ships and ferries. 4. Environmental factors: The shipbuilding industry must also contend with growing concern for the environment, including climate change and pollution. Regulations aimed at reducing emissions from ships or protecting marine ecosystems might require substantial investments in research and development, as well as costly updates to facilities and equipment. While these goals are necessary from an environmental perspective, they can also lead to increased costs for the shipbuilding industry in the short term. 5. Technological factors: The pace of technological change can also pose challenges for the shipbuilding industry. Companies must constantly adapt to new technologies, materials, and processes to stay competitive. For instance, the increasing focus on autonomous and electric vessels requires substantial investment in the development of new systems and infrastructures. This can put additional pressure on the industry to innovate rapidly while remaining economically viable. In conclusion, the shipbuilding industry can be significantly impacted by various factors such as economic, political, social, environmental, and technological influences. The phrase \\"Laivanrakennusteollisuus ei varmasti hyödy siitä\\" suggests that there is a factor or situation at hand that will certainly not benefit the industry. Considering the potential challenges discussed above, any of those factors (or a combination of them) may be responsible for negatively affecting the shipbuilding industry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the person who was executed by the federal government on June 11, 2001? Social tensions were exacerbated by the revival of the Ku Klux Klan after 1915. The Tulsa Race Riot broke out in 1921, with whites attacking blacks. In one of the costliest episodes of racial violence in American history, sixteen hours of rioting resulted in 35 city blocks destroyed, 1.8 million in property damage, and a death toll estimated to be as high as 300 people. By the late 1920s, the Ku Klux Klan had declined to negligible influence within the state.During the 1930s, parts of the state began suffering the consequences of poor farming practice. This period was known as the Dust Bowl, throughout which areas of Kansas, Texas, New Mexico and northwestern Oklahoma were hampered by long periods of little rainfall, strong winds, and abnormally high temperatures, sending thousands of farmers into poverty and forcing them to relocate to more fertile areas of the western United States. Over a twenty-year period ending in 1950, the state saw its only historical decline in population, dropping 6.9 percent as impoverished families migrated out of the state after the Dust Bowl. Soil and water conservation projects markedly changed practices in the state and led to the construction of massive flood control systems and dams; they built hundreds of reservoirs and man-made lakes to supply water for domestic needs and agricultural irrigation. By the 1960s, Oklahoma had created more than 200 lakes, the most in the nation.In 1995, Oklahoma City was the site of one of the most destructive acts of domestic terrorism in American history. The Oklahoma City bombing of April 19, 1995, in which Timothy McVeigh detonated a large, crude explosive device outside the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, killed 168 people, including 19 children. For his crime, McVeigh was executed by the federal government on June 11, 2001.

Leslie, on the other hand, either doesn't share the same affinity for coffee or may have other personal reasons or lifestyle choices that affect her decision not to consume it in the same manner as Jason. Perhaps Leslie might be more sensitive to caffeine and may experience adverse side effects such as increased anxiety, jitteriness, or insomnia. It could also be that Leslie prefers alternative methods or beverages to stay energized, like herbal teas or natural energy-boosting supplements. Furthermore, it's possible that Leslie's dietary preferences or restrictions limit her consumption of coffee. Those who follow specific diets, like paleo, keto, or vegan, might choose not to drink coffee due to the potential additional caloric intake from added sugars, creamers, and sweeteners, or the presence of animal-derived ingredients in certain additives. Leslie may also be aware of medical conditions such as acid reflux, which could be aggravated by coffee, or may simply not enjoy the taste or aroma of it. Additionally, Leslie might prioritize physical activity or regular breaks during the day to recharge and maintain her energy levels naturally, rather than relying on caffeine. This could be in the form of exercise, meditation, or engaging in a hobby to refresh her mind and body. In any case, Jason's decision to consume 4 cups of coffee every day stems from his belief that it's an effective way to boost his overall performance and stay actively engaged in his daily tasks.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. First question: Is self love selfish? Second question: Is love selfish or selfless? Are these two questions asking the same thing? Select from: 1). no; 2). yes;","completion":"First question: Is self-love selfish? To determine whether self-love is selfish, it is necessary to understand the concept of self-love and selfishness. Self-love refers to the practice of taking care of one's own wellbeing, showing compassion to oneself, and recognizing the essential worth and value of oneself as a person. It is about prioritizing one's mental, emotional, and physical health. Selfishness, on the other hand, is characterized by a lack of consideration for others, being concerned primarily with one's interests or welfare at the expense of others. It's important to note that self-love is not inherently selfish. Self-love does not entail disregarding or dismissing the needs and feelings of others, but rather, it means being responsible for our well-being and understanding our value. In fact, understanding and practicing self-love makes us better equipped to establish stronger relationships with others and be more compassionate towards their feelings and experiences. A healthy level of self-love also enables us to set boundaries, which is essential in preventing ourselves from getting engulfed by the needs of others, compromising our mental and emotional health. Second question: Is love selfish or selfless? Love is a complex concept that can manifest in different forms, such as romantic love, familial love, or love for friends. Love can be both selfish and selfless, or, ideally, a balanced mix of both. Selfish love may involve prioritizing one's own needs, desires, or feelings above those of the other person. While some level of self-interest is natural and necessary in any relationship, excessive selfishness can become problematic and harmful. If love becomes possessive or controlling, or if the wellbeing of one person is consistently put above the other(s), this indicates that the love has turned predominantly selfish. Selfless love, on the other hand, refers to putting the needs, wants, and feelings of others above our own. It involves giving and caring without expecting anything in return. However, too much selflessness may not be healthy, as total disregard for personal needs can lead to feelings of resentment or loss of self-identity over time. Ideally, love should maintain a balance of selfishness and selflessness, where both parties prioritize and respect the needs of each other. The most successful and fulfilling relationships allow for a mutual exchange of care, compassion, and consideration. Are these two questions asking the same thing? The answer is 2). yes. Despite the differences between self-love and love for others, the questions \\"Is self-love selfish?\\" and \\"Is love selfish or selfless?\\" share a common theme. Both questions fundamentally explore whether love, be it for oneself or others, should be entirely selfless or if it's acceptable and healthy to maintain some level of self-interest. As discussed, a balanced and nuanced approach is essential for both self-love and love for others, suggesting that the two questions are indeed asking the same thing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.
