Washington (CNN) -- State visits to the White House are full of show and symbolism, and Tuesday's visit by Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is no exception. But Singh's visit, the first state visit hosted by the Obama administration, reflects India's growing political and economic importance to the United States and the deepening partnership between Washington and New Delhi. The 2005 civil nuclear cooperation deal between the two countries symbolized a new status in U.S.-India relations. But that deal, yet to be ratified by the Indian parliament, was not in a vacuum. The Bush administration followed that up with agreements for increased cooperation on security, science and technology and education. The relationship is not without its irritants, however, the biggest one being India's nuclear neighbor,","completion":"Pakistan. Tensions between India and Pakistan have long been a source of concern for the US, as they strive to maintain stability in the region. The two nations have fought multiple wars and skirmishes over the years, mainly due to disputes over the Kashmir region. The US has been actively involved in diplomatic efforts to diffuse tensions between the two nuclear-armed powers, understanding that any full-scale conflict risks impacting the broader South Asian region and beyond. Another point of contention in the US-India relationship is the issue of trade. While trade between the two nations has grown significantly over the past few years, reaching nearly 160 billion in 2019, there have been disagreements on matters such as tariffs and intellectual property rights. Both countries have occasionally imposed new trade barriers on each other's products, displaying their occasional friction in the economic sphere. Despite these challenges, the leaders of the two countries have worked to strengthen their strategic partnership. High-level meetings, such as the one between President Obama and Prime Minister Singh, demonstrate the commitment on both sides to engage and collaborate on various issues, including defense, counter-terrorism, and climate change. The US and India also conduct joint military exercises to build ties and improve their interoperability on the battlefield. In conclusion, while the relationship between the US and India has its share of challenges, the overall trajectory points to a growing convergence of interests and deepening cooperation in various spheres. The first state visit by Prime Minister Singh to the Obama White House was an unmistakable sign of the importance the US places on fostering its ties with India, acknowledging its increasing clout on the world stage. As both countries continue to develop their strategic partnership, they will aim to overcome their differences and focus on shared objectives for mutual benefit and to ensure regional and global stability. It remains to be seen how this relationship will evolve amid geopolitical shifts and changing domestic political landscapes, but there is no denying the significant progress made in recent years."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the following context: In 1947, Inspector Garvey of Scotland Yard suspects Michael Lanyard, the reformed jewel thief known as \\"The Lone Wolf\\" is behind the theft of the priceless diamonds called the \\"Eyes of the Nile\\". Lanyard denies any involvement claiming that he is in London with his butler, Claudius Jamison to write a book on the jewels and was in New York when they were stolen. Lanyard and Jamison are short of funds and when Ann Kelmscott, the daughter of wealthy gem collector Sir John Kelmscott, invites them to the family estate, they agree. Sir John confides that he is in desperate need of money and asks Lanyard to arrange a confidential loan with part of his jewel collection as collateral. Jamison tells his master that Lily (Queenie Leonard), the maid, told him the butler, Henry Robards, is heartbroken because his former wife, actress Iris Chatham, has run off with Monty Beresford who financed the lavish stage production that launched Iris to stardom. Back at his hotel, Lanyard receives a call from Iris, inviting him to the theater that night where she asks him to stay away from the Kelmscotts. At her apartment, Robards begs her for a reconciliation, but she demands something first. Lanyard decides to accept Kelmscott's offer and arranges to meet Bruce Tang, a gem dealer the next morning. Kelmscott gives Robards a packet of jewels to deliver to Lanyard but he steals the Eyes of the Nile for Iris. David Woolerton, Ann's fiancé, asks him for a ride because he wants to spy on Lanyard. At Tang's shop, Inspector Garvey has followed Lanyard. When Robards' car rolls to a stop, the butler is dead behind the wheel, the jewels still in his possession but the Eyes of the Nile are gone.

The Food and Agriculture Organization says fish farming is growing at a rate of 6.6 percent a year. Fish farming now produces forty-six percent of the world's supply of fish. That represents a forty-three percent increase from 2006. The report also said fish farming earned more money in 2008 than traditional fisheries. In fish farming, fish are raised in tanks or small bodies of water called ponds. They are also raised in cages or nets in oceans, lakes and rivers. The report says increased fish farming has helped people around the world eat record amounts of fish. The FAO says each person ate an average of almost seventeen kilograms of fish last year. However, the FAO says the current yearly wild-fish harvest of ninety million tons shows no improvement. Decreasing numbers of fish and stronger catch limits have reduced the possibilities for catching wild fish. The FAO report says about thirty-two percent of world supplies are overfished. It says these supplies of fish need to be rebuilt at once. Some scientists have criticized fish farming. They say the nets and cages permit fish diseases and pests to spread. Some fish farming critics doubt whether fish farming can keep growing at the current rate. But Wally Stevens of the trade group Global Aquaculture Alliance says the industry must continue developing to feed growing populations. Mr. Stevens says a one hundred percent increase in fish farming over ten years is necessary to keep providing for people at the current level. He notes that fish farming creates jobs and wealth, especially for people in coastal areas of China. Question: What does Wally Stevens think of fish farming?

Pavel Nedved (Czech pronunciation: ['pavel 'nedvjet] ( listen); born 30 August 1972) is a Czech retired footballer who played as a midfielder. Described as one of the best footballers of his generation, he is also regarded as one of the most successful players to emerge from the Czech Republic, winning domestic and European accolades with Italian clubs Lazio, including the last Cup Winners' Cup, and Juventus, whom he led to the 2003 UEFA Champions League Final. Nedved was a key member of the Czech team which reached the final of Euro 1996, during which he attracted international attention. He also captained the national team at UEFA Euro 2004, where they were defeated in the semi-final by eventual champions Greece, and Nedved was named as part of the Team of the Tournament. Nedved made his league debut for Lazio on 7 September 1996 in a 1-0 away defeat against Bologna. He scored his first league goal for the club against Cagliari on 20 October 1996, finishing the 1996-97 season with seven goals. He became an integral part of the side, scoring four goals in three matches early in the 1997-98 season. The club had a 24-match unbeaten streak from November 1997 to April 1998, ending with a league match against Juventus in which Nedved was sent off. That season, Lazio won the 1997-98 Coppa Italia and reached the final of the 1997-98 UEFA Cup. Nedved and Lazio began the 1998-99 season with a victory in the Supercoppa Italiana, Nedved scoring as the club defeated Juventus 2-1. He played a role in Lazio's road to the last-ever Cup Winners' Cup, scoring against Lausanne in the first round and in both legs of Lazio's 7-0 aggregate quarter-final victory over Panionios. In the 1999 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final, Nedved scored the decisive goal against Mallorca for Lazio's 2-1 win. This proved to be the last goal of the tournament, which was later discontinued. Nedved was one of the ten highest-paid footballers in the Italian league in 1999. He played in the 1999 UEFA Super Cup against Manchester United at the beginning of the season, where Lazio won the match by a single goal. The club went on to win the Serie A title and Coppa Italia, completing a domestic double in 2000 with Nedved's help. In 2000, he won the Supercoppa Italiana with Lazio for a second time. With Sinisa Mihajlovic, Nedved was one of two Lazio players sent off in the quarter-final of the 2000 Coppa Italia held in December, where the defending champions lost 5-3 on aggregate to Udinese. Nedved played UEFA Champions League football with Lazio, scoring against Real Madrid in a 2-2 draw in the second group stage before the Italian side was eliminated. In Lazio's final Champions League match of the season, Nedved was criticised by Leeds United manager David O'Leary for a challenge on Alan Maybury (although the referee did not call a foul), and he received a three-match suspension from European competitions from UEFA. Despite Nedved's signing a new four-year contract with Lazio in April 2001, the club tried to sell him and teammate Juan Sebastian Veron that summer, triggering fan protests against club chairman Sergio Cragnotti. The players were ultimately sold to Juventus and Manchester United respectively. Entity:","completion":"Pavel Nedved"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Write a title for this article: HONG KONG — Protesters demanding democracy in Hong Kong delivered a stinging rebuff to the government late on Friday by reclaiming a street that police had forcibly cleared earlier in the day. Hundreds of demonstrators cheered ecstatically when, after hours of mounting tensions, the outnumbered police were ordered to retreat rather than risk an escalating confrontation. The action was centered on Nathan Road in the volatile Mong Kok neighborhood, an area teeming with shops and neon signs where demonstrators had blocked streets with barriers and tents and had snarled traffic for nearly three weeks, demanding a democratic ballot for choosing Hong Kong’s next leader. The police moved in early Friday morning and swiftly reopened all but a small area to traffic. But by evening the move had backfired, drawing the biggest crowds in weeks to the area and forcing the police to deploy hundreds of officers, many of them in full riot gear with helmets, batons and shields. Three officers were injured in the clashes, one with an unspecified head injury, the police said in a statement. It was not known how many protesters were hurt. As they have several times recently, the police used pepper spray to help quell the crowds. Alex Wong, a bank worker in his 20s wearing a medical mask, goggles and towel on his head, said he had come to Mong Kok to show his anger at the police operation. “I’m very scared,” Mr. Wong said. “But I’m here to fight for the future of Hong Kong. The price of democracy and freedom is not cheap.” Like many other protesters, he said he did not trust established political parties and student groups to negotiate effectively with the government. “Mong Kok is more the true voice of Hong Kong citizens,” he said. Guidelines issued by China’s national legislature in late September effectively guarantee that only pro-Beijing candidates can appear on the ballot for chief executive, the top position in Hong Kong, in the elections scheduled for 2017. The protesters say those rules violate commitments Beijing made when Britain returned the territory to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 after more than 150 years of British rule. Before the last three weeks, clashes between police and angry crowds were uncommon in Hong Kong, one of the world’s richest cities. It has a reputation for stability and good governance, and is home to the Asia headquarters for scores of multinational corporations, law firms and banks. The 1997 agreement called for the city’s British-based legal system and civil liberties to be preserved for 50 years after the handover to China. The scene at Nathan Road on Friday turned into a churning confrontation between hundreds of masked protesters and the police, who stripped away the protesters’ umbrellas and struggled to contain flare-ups with the surging crowd. Nearby, on Argyle Street, the police struggled on Friday to contain crowds as they chanted “Open the road,” and “Cross the street.” Several young men were hauled away by the police, prompting roars of disapproval from the crowd. Several of the masked protesters said they had no intention of charging at the police but wanted to show their support for the Mong Kok protest, which was more diverse and raucous than the main sit-in outside the government’s headquarters in Admiralty, where students dominate. “I came here to be a witness if there is police violence,” said Mani, an office assistant who declined to give her surname. “We don’t want violence. Most of the police are not bad men, but we’ve seen the illegal things they have done.” Though many protesters in the crowd wore goggles and surgical masks, now customary protections against pepper spray, most appeared reluctant to challenge the police cordons. “I want to reoccupy Mong Kok,” said one goggled university student who gave only his first name, Simon. “This was supposed to be our road for occupy.”","completion":"\\"Democracy Defiant: Hong Kong Protesters Reclaim Street after Police Clearance\\""},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

How does overdosing on painkillers or sleeping pills cause death? How many sleeping pills could kill someone? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","completion":"I will address each question separately and then compare them to determine if they are the same. Question 1: How does overdosing on painkillers or sleeping pills cause death? Step 1: Understand the context of the question: The question is asking about the potential lethal effects of taking an overdose of painkillers or sleeping pills. Step 2: Address the first part of the question - painkillers: An overdose of painkillers, particularly opioids, can cause death primarily by depressing the central nervous system (CNS). When the CNS is depressed, it slows down vital functions such as breathing and blood circulation. An overdose can lead to slowed or stopped breathing (respiratory depression), which reduces oxygen intake, potentially resulting in hypoxia, organ failure, and ultimately death. Step 3: Address the second part of the question - sleeping pills: An overdose of sleeping pills, particularly sedative-hypnotic drugs such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates, can also lead to CNS depression. In excessive amounts, they can cause severe drowsiness, loss of muscle control, decreased blood pressure, and slowed or stopped breathing. In some cases, an overdose can lead to a coma or death. Question 2: How many sleeping pills could kill someone? Step 1: Clarify the factors that affect the lethal dosage: The number of sleeping pills that could result in a lethal overdose varies depending on individual factors, such as age, weight, health status, drug tolerance, and the type and strength of the sleeping pill. Additionally, mixing substances, such as sleeping pills with alcohol or other drugs, can increase the risk of a lethal outcome even at lower dosages. Step 2: Emphasize the importance of following medical guidelines and avoiding self-medication: It is crucial to follow the prescribed dosage given by a medical professional and to never exceed the recommended daily intake. Self-medication and altering dosages without a doctor's supervision can be dangerous and potentially life-threatening. Comparison of the two questions: While both questions deal with overdose and the potentially lethal outcomes of painkillers and sleeping pills, they are not the same. The first question seeks to understand the mechanism by which an overdose of these types of substances can cause death. The second question, on the other hand, inquires about the approximate number of sleeping pills that could result in a fatal outcome. Although related, they ask for different aspects of the topic."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

The closure has left 500 individuals unemployed, dealing a crushing blow to both the local economy and the centennial heritage. Fortunately, not all hope is lost for these jobless workers. One of the laid-off employees has taken a proactive approach by creating a website dedicated to listing the names and skills of their former colleagues. This incredible initiative aims to help the unemployed find new opportunities with prospective employers who can match their skill sets and expertise. The website facilitates the search process by categorizing former factory workers based on their specific job titles, such as engineers and electricians. This streamlined system allows potential employers to effortlessly pinpoint the right person for a job opening, simplifying the arduous search process by which job seekers are usually exposed. In the midst of uncertain times, this initiative serves as an inspiration and a lifeline, rekindling hope for the jobless in this tight-knit community. The website creator's resourcefulness and empathy have galvanized those around them, fostering a sense of camaraderie and shared resilience among the factory's former workforce. Currently, the website has generated promising results, with 30 job guarantees in the pipeline. Though the majority of these available positions are for unskilled labor, it marks a significant and encouraging milestone for the laid-off individuals in their quest for new jobs. As the days go by, the website has the potential to attract even more prospective employers and create a space for networking and collaboration, not just for the displaced factory workers, but for the overall community. The cigar factory's closure serves as an impetus for change and adaptation, pushing these skilled workers to explore new opportunities in different industries and sectors. The story of the shuttered cigar factory and the subsequent outpouring of support is one that resonates far beyond Tampa. It captures the essence of human resilience as well as the importance of innovation and resourcefulness in the face of adversity. The tenacity showcased by the factory workers and the creator of the website is a beacon of inspiration for anyone grappling with unemployment or economic hardship. Despite the setback, this community continues to embody the spirit of perseverance that has defined it for over a century. With a wealth of experience under their belts, these former cigar factory employees are more than ready to face new challenges and prove their worth in the ever-evolving job market. As the website continues to grow and expand its reach, it becomes an important representation of both the hardships faced by the jobless and the enduring strength of the human spirit to adapt and overcome. As Tampa, Florida bids a somber farewell to one of its fabled cigar factories, it simultaneously embraces its future, a renewed sense of unity and hope for the jobless workers that remain part of its storied history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Besides taking care of her home and family, Gloria also works as a cleaning lady to make ends meet and takes amphetamines to keep going. Her marriage to Antonio, a male chauvinist taxi driver, is on the rocks. Fifteen years earlier, in Germany, Antonio worked as a driver for Ingrid Muller, a German singer with whom he had a brief affair. His only mementos of their liaison are a signed photograph and a tape of her song Nur nicht aus Liebe Weinen which he constantly plays and which Gloria detests.

In his taxi Antonio meets the writer Lucas and Antonio casually mentions this fact to Lucas, who suggests that they forge Hitler's diaries for big profit.

This led to the Battle of Plassey on 23 June 1757, in which the Bengal Army of the East India Company, led by Robert Clive, defeated the French-supported Nawab's forces. This was the first real political foothold with territorial implications that the British acquired in India. Clive was appointed by the company as its first 'Governor of Bengal' in 1757. This was combined with British victories over the French at Madras, Wandiwash and Pondichéry that, along with wider British successes during the Seven Years' War, reduced French influence in India. The British East India Company extended its control over the whole of Bengal. After the Battle of Buxar in 1764, the company acquired the rights of administration in Bengal from de jure Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II; this marked the beginning of its formal rule, which within the next century engulfed most of India.

She walks over to the pond to see if it has fallen in, when it appears on the other side. She goes over to pet it, when a hand grabs her and pulls her into the pond, before pulling the cat in as well. After this, a hard candy floats to the top, and her phone begins to scroll through various numbers.After the credits roll, we are introduced to Beth Raymond (Shannyn Sossamon), who is having a party with her friends Brian (Johnny Lewis), and Taylor (Ana Claudia Talancon). She goes to the door, and looks through the peephole, where she has a flashback to when she was a girl. She answers the door, and Leann is there.Beth and Leann go upstairs and Leann mentions that she was at Shelley's funeral, and that Shelley's parents were convinced she committed suicide. Beth tells Leann that Shelley went strange before she died. Suddenly, Leann's phone rings with an eerie ringtone. Leann tells Beth that it is not her ringtone, and delays in answering, because she sees it is from Shelley's phone, so the call goes to voicemail. She listens to it, and it horrified. Beth asks to listen to it, and it plays a recording of Leann talking about seeing things before screaming. Leann tells Beth that it is from 2 days in the future.Meanwhile, Detective Jack Andrews (Edward Burns) gets a call from the mortuary, asking them to come and identify a body. They tell him it has been in the water for a couple of days. He pulls the cover off and confirms it is his sister. He is left alone with the body, and finds that there is something in her mouth. He pulls it out and reveals it to be a hard candy.Fast forward two days, and Leann is at college with Beth. She hallucinates seeing a centipede crawling along...

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Mark works as a scientist for a molecular research institute. Today, he has three samples of molecule in front of him, sample A, sample B, and sample C. Sample A is a straight-chain molecule; sample B is a branched-chain molecule; and sample C is a cyclic molecule. Mark's job is to determine the characteristics of each sample. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which sample would have lower boiling point, sample A or sample C? Hint: A) In a straight-chain molecule, all the carbon atoms are lined up in a row like cars of a train. The carbon atoms form the “backbone” of the molecule. B) In a branched-chain molecule, at least one of the carbon atoms branches off from the backbone. C) In a cyclic molecule, the chain of carbon atoms is joined at the two ends to form a ring. Each ring usually contains just five or six carbon atoms, but rings can join together to form larger molecules. A cyclic molecule generally has higher boiling and melting points than straight-chain and branched-chain molecules. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Sample A would have a lower boiling point compared to sample C. This is due to the fact that boiling points are greatly influenced by the type of intermolecular forces present within a given molecule. The stronger the intermolecular force, the higher the boiling point of the molecule. These forces include dipole-dipole forces, hydrogen bonding, and London dispersion forces. Considering the provided information, sample A is a straight-chain molecule. Straight-chain molecules typically have fewer points of contact between their molecules, and this results in weaker intermolecular forces specifically London dispersion forces, which then contribute to a lower boiling point. On the other hand, sample C is a cyclic molecule. Cyclic molecules, due to their ring structure, pack together more efficiently, increasing the points of interaction between the molecules. This gives cyclic molecules generally stronger intermolecular forces and thus, higher boiling and melting points. Thus, in comparison, sample A, being a straight-chain molecule, would likely have a weaker London dispersion force, hence a lower boiling point than sample C, which is a cyclic molecule. This is, of course, assuming that the two samples are similar in terms of molecular weight and functional groups, as these can also have an impact on boiling points."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Based on the information provided in the premise, this man is an ex-soldier, which means that he was once a soldier but is not currently serving in that capacity. The hypothesis that he is a former soldier aligns with the information provided in the premise, as being an ex-soldier inherently means he was a soldier in the past but is not anymore. Comparing the two statements: Premise: This man is an ex-soldier. Hypothesis: He is a former soldier. Both the terms \\"ex-soldier\\" and \\"former soldier\\" convey similar meanings, indicating that the person was once a soldier but is not one at the present moment.

The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän. - Grini is a district in northeastern Bærum, Norway. - Christian IV (12 April 1577 28 February 1648), sometimes colloquially referred to as Christian Firtal in Denmark and Christian Kvart or Quart in Norway, was king of Denmark-Norway and Duke of Holstein and Schleswig from 1588 to 1648. His 59-year reign is the longest of Danish monarchs, and of Scandinavian monarchies. - Ruter AS is the public transport authority for Oslo and Akershus counties in Norway. Formally a limited company 60% of the shares in which are owned by the Oslo county municipality and 40% by that of Akershus it is responsible for administrating, funding, and marketing (but not operating) public transport in the two counties, including buses, the Oslo Metro (\\"T-banen i Oslo\\"), Oslo Trams (\\"Trikken i Oslo\\"), and ferry services. Ruter also holds agreements with the Norwegian State Railways concerning the regulation of fares on commuter train services operated within the two counties. - Sporveien T-banen AS is a limited company that is responsible for operating Oslo Metro, the rapid transit in Oslo, Norway. The company is owned by Sporveien, which is owned by the city council. Sporveien operates on a contract with Ruter, the public transport administration in Oslo and Akershus. - Haakon V Magnusson (10 April 1270 - 8 May 1319) (Old Norse: \\"Hákon Magnússon\\"; Norwegian: \\"Håkon Magnusson\\") was king of Norway from 1299 until 1319. - The Oslo Metro (or or simply ) is the rapid transit system of Oslo, Norway, operated by Sporveien T-banen on contract from the transit authority Ruter. The network consists of five lines that all run through the city centre, with a total length of , serving 101 stations of which 17 are underground or indoors. In addition to serving 14 out of the 15 boroughs of Oslo (all except St. Hanshaugen), two lines run to Bærum. In 2015, the system had an annual ridership of 94.4 million. - Ekraveien is the last Oslo Metro station on the Røa Line within Oslo 's city limits . It is between the stations Røa and Eiksmarka . It was opened 22 December 1948 when the Røa Line was extended to Grini . Ekraveien itself is a road which runs north from the station to Bogstad . The neighborhood around the station is residential , consisting mostly of detached housing . - The Kolsås Line is line of the Oslo Metro. It branches off from the Røa Line at Smestad Station and runs through western Oslo and Bærum to Kolsås Station. It serves the neighborhoods of Ullernåsen, Øraker, Jar, Bekkestua, Haslum, Gjettum and Kolsås. It is served by Line 3 of the metro at a 15-minute headway.

It differs from a federation in that each constituent state has an independent government, whereas a unitary state is united by a central government. The ruler in a personal union does not need to be a hereditary monarch. - History. The introduction of self-government in rural districts was a major political change. The Norwegian farm culture (\\"bondekultur\\") that emerged came to serve as a symbol of nationalistic resistance to the forced union with Sweden. The legislation of 1837 gave both the towns and the rural areas the same institutions: a minor change for the town, but a major advance for the rural communities. The significance of this legislation is hailed by a nationalistic historian, Ernst Sars: - Oslo is the capital and the most populous city in Norway. It constitutes both a county and a municipality. Founded in the year 1040, and established as a \\"kaupstad\\" or trading place in 1048 by Harald Hardrada, the city was elevated to a bishopric in 1070 and a capital under Haakon V of Norway around 1300. Personal unions with Denmark from 1397 to 1523 and again from 1536 to 1814 and with Sweden from 1814 to 1905 reduced its influence. After being destroyed by a fire in 1624, the city was moved closer to Akershus Fortress during the reign of Christian IV of Denmark and renamed Christiania in his honour. It was established as a municipality (\\"formannskapsdistrikt\\") on 1 January 1838. Following a spelling reform, it was known as Kristiania from 1877 to 1925, at which time its original Norwegian name was restored. - Akershus is a county in Norway, bordering Hedmark, Oppland, Buskerud, Oslo, and Østfold; it also has a short border with Sweden (Värmland). Akershus, with more than half a million inhabitants, is the second-largest county by population after Oslo. The county is named after Akershus Fortress. The county administration is in Oslo, which is not part of the county \\"per se\\". - Bærum is a municipality in Akershus county, Norway. The administrative centre of the municipality is the town of Sandvika. Bærum was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838. A suburb of Oslo, Bærum is located on the west coast of the city. - Røa was a borough of the city of Oslo, Norway up to January 1, 2004, when it became part of the Vestre Aker district. Røa is also a suburb of Oslo, located approximately 7 kilometers away from downtown Oslo. It primarily consists of duplex houses and apartment blocks as well as single-family detached homes. It also has a small shopping mall. - The Røa Line is a rapid transit line of the Oslo Metro, Norway, which runs from Majorstuen in Oslo to Østerås in Bærum. It serves neighborhoods such as Smestad, Hovseter, Huseby and Røa in northwestern Oslo, and Grini, Øvrevoll and Østerås in northeastern Bærum. The line is served by Line 2 of the metro, which connects to the city center via the Common Tunnel and onwards along the Furuset Line. The lowest part of the Røa Line, consisting of two stations, is shared with the Kolsås Line, and thus also served by Line 2 of the metro. The Røa Line is owned by Kollektivtransportproduksjon, and operated by Oslo T-banedrift on contract with the public transport agency Ruter. - Harald Sigurdsson (Old Norse: \\"Haraldr Sigurðarson\\"; c. 1015 25 September 1066), given the epithet Hardrada (\\"harðráði\\", roughly translated as \\"stern counsel\\" or \\"hard ruler\\") in the sagas, was King of Norway (as Harald III) from 1046 to 1066. In addition, he unsuccessfully claimed the Danish throne until 1064 and the English throne in 1066. Prior to becoming king, Harald had spent around fifteen years in exile as a mercenary and military commander in Kievan Rus' and of the Varangian Guard in the Byzantine Empire. - The Common Tunnel, sometimes called the Common Line, is a long tunnel of the Oslo Metro which runs through the city center of Oslo, Norway.

How is \\"I'll fly out of O'Hare, I'll meet you at the house.\\" said in Czech?","completion":"In Czech, \\"I'll fly out of O'Hare, I'll meet you at the house.\\" can be translated as \\"Odletím z O'Hare, setkám se s tebou doma.\\" Here's a breakdown of the translation: 1. \\"Odletím\\" - This is the Czech equivalent of \\"I'll fly out.\\" In this context, it implies leaving from the airport (O'Hare in this case). The verb \\"odletět\\" in the first person future tense (odletím) is used. 2. \\"z\\" - This preposition conveys the meaning of \\"from\\" or \\"out of\\" in English. When referring to a departure point or location, \\"z\\" is used in Czech. 3. \\"O'Hare\\" - O'Hare International Airport is located in Chicago, and since it's a proper noun, it does not change when translating to Czech. 4. \\"setkám se\\" - This phrase is translated as \\"I'll meet\\" in English. In Czech, the verb \\"setkat se\\" implies \\"to meet (someone).\\" In this case, the first person future tense (setkám se) is used. 5. \\"s tebou\\" - This means \\"with you\\" in English.

Determined to find the killer and bring him to justice, Evan decides to form a neighborhood watch. However, he only manages to recruit Bob (Vince Vaughn), a construction worker and loving father; Franklin (Jonah Hill), a high school dropout who dreams of being a police officer but failed the written, physical, and mental-health tests; and Jamarcus (Richard Ayoade), a recent divorce. The watch members use the group as an excuse to drink and have fun (much to Evan's annoyance). While driving on patrol, they accidentally hit something. They discover a strange metallic orb that acts as a highly-destructive weapon, and deduce that it is of alien origin. Meanwhile, several more townspeople are mysteriously killed. The watch responds to the murders and encounters an alien, which attacks them. Evan (apparently) kills it with a lawn gnome before the group returns with the creature to Bob's house. The creature regains consciousness and escapes, stealing the metallic orb and warning them that the aliens have already infiltrated the town. The watch theorizes that the aliens are stealing their victims' skin and disguising themselves as humans, so anyone in Glenview could be an alien.

Write an article based on this \\"Scotland will boost their Six Nations hopes if they can secure back-to-back wins by beating Georgia on Saturday, captain Greig Laidlaw says.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: \\"Scotland's Exciting Adventure to Win Big in Six Nations by Playing Against Georgia\\" Once upon a time in a land called Scotland, there lived a team of very strong and fast people who enjoyed playing a game called rugby. Rugby is a fun sport where two teams of players run with a ball and try to score points by placing the ball behind the other team's goal area. These strong and fast Scots were getting ready for a big event called the \\"Six Nations.\\" This is a huge rugby competition that happens every year, with teams from six different countries: Scotland, England, Ireland, Wales, France, and Italy. They all come together to see who will be the best at playing this super fun game. Now, the captain of Scotland's team, his name is Greig Laidlaw, had an important thought in his mind. He believed that if his team could win another game in a row, they would have an even better chance of doing great in the Six Nations competition. So, he encouraged everyone on his team to work extra hard and play with all their might. One day, the team from Scotland had a game against the team from a country called Georgia. This was a very important game for the Scots, because if they could win this match, it would help them be stronger and more confident in the Six Nations competition. Captain Greig knew that back-to-back wins would be excellent, because it is like having two yummy ice cream cones, one right after the other! The Scottish players trained and practiced, and they listened to Captain Greig's wise words and believed in themselves. They were all so excited to play against Georgia and give it their best. So, on a beautiful Saturday afternoon, the people from Scotland and Georgia came together on a special field designed just for playing rugby. And do you know what happened? The whole world was watching, waiting to see who would win, and which team would take another important step on their way to the big Six Nations event. Everyone in Scotland was cheering and hoping that Captain Greig and his strong and fast players would win this important game. While the two teams played their hardest on that Saturday, everyone learned an important lesson: that in sports and in life, we should always believe in ourselves and never give up. No matter the outcome, the Scotland rugby team was already a winner in the hearts of their fans."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: There are as many types of curators as there are types of museums - art museums, history museums, children’s museums, science museums, and a vast range of specializations in between. You will need to choose what sort of museum you want to work for in order to pursue the appropriate education. Consider what experiences have influenced your desire to be a museum curator. Were you inspired by an Aztec history exhibit you saw on a school field trip? Do you dream of working in a place like the Metropolitan Museum of Art? Be as specific as possible. If you know you want to work in a science museum, think about what aspects of science interest you the most. Chemistry? Physics? Astronomy? The more specific your choice, the more extensively you can educate yourself in it. Many colleges offer Bachelor’s degrees in museology, or museum studies, but it’s not absolutely necessary that you choose this as your major. Museums will look for candidates with extensive education and experience in a field that is relevant to what they’re curating, such as art or history, as well as knowledge of business administration, marketing, and fundraising. Bachelor’s degrees typically take 4 years to complete, although it may take more if you choose a double major. By this time, you should have some idea of what subject you want to focus on. If you became particularly interested in African art while getting your Bachelor’s in art history, look for Master’s programs that have a focus in African art. Look at the faculty of graduate departments as well as the programs. Who you work with can have a great impact on your education, as well as your career. Many curators find jobs through the recommendations of professors in their field, so building a good relationship with faculty is a must. Graduate programs typically take between 1.5 and 3 years to complete. Many lower-level curatorial positions only require a Master’s, but if you want to become curator at a national museum, you’ll need a PhD. This should be in the field you wish to specialize in. Because of the competitive nature of this field, a specialized degree is increasingly necessary. You want to demonstrate as much expertise in whatever you hope to curate as possible. When you choose a subject for your thesis, it’s ideal to find something unique that will stand out from other research in your field. Educate yourself on what research has already been done and aim to make a distinctive contribution. PhD programs typically take at least 5 years (the average length, however, is 8.2 years). Summary:","completion":"This article talks about how to become a museum curator. A curator takes care of a museum's stuff and decides what to show. There are many types of museums, like art, history, and science. First, think about what kind of museum you want to work in and learn a lot about that subject. You might go to college to study museums or something like art, history, or science. After college, you might study even more about your favorite subject. It's important to make friends with your teachers because they can help you find a job. Some jobs need even more school, like a PhD. Being a curator is special, so it's good to know a lot about one thing and find something new to study."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: I can use this background: No doubt you already have a good idea of what temperature is. You might say that it’s how warm or cool something feels. In physics, temperature is defined as the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. When particles of matter move more quickly, they have more kinetic energy, so their temperature is higher. With a higher temperature, matter feels warmer. When particles move more slowly, they have less kinetic energy on average, so their temperature is lower. With a lower temperature, matter feels cooler. Now, I have a new situation: Matt is reheating some leftover pizza in the microwave for his stepchildren, Lauren and Emily. Lauren likes her pizza at a high temperature when reheated so Matt cooks it for a long time. Emily likes her pizza at a lower temperature so Matt only puts hers in the microwave for a couple seconds. Answer this question please: Are the particles in Emily's pizza moving faster or slower than in Lauren's pizza? Answer:","completion":"The particles in Emily's pizza are moving slower than in Lauren's pizza. Since Emily prefers her pizza at a lower temperature and it is only microwaved for a couple of seconds, the particles in her pizza have not gained as much kinetic energy as the particles in Lauren's pizza, which is heated for a longer time and at a higher temperature. Therefore, the particles in Emily's pizza are moving more slowly compared to those in Lauren's pizza, resulting in a cooler temperature."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Which animal will win: squirrel or scorpion? Which animal will win in a fight: a squirrel or a frog? Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? Choices: A). no; B). yes;","completion":"A). No, these questions are not the same. These questions present different scenarios and involve different sets of animals. The first question inquires about the outcome of a confrontation between a squirrel and a scorpion, while the second question asks about a fight between a squirrel and a frog. Although both questions involve a squirrel, the opponents are different, and as a result, the answers to the questions will vary. To address the first question, a squirrel and a scorpion inhabit different ecological niches and are unlikely to confront each other naturally. Squirrels are small mammals that mostly live in trees, while scorpions are arachnids that thrive in diverse environments, including deserts, grasslands, and forests. Squirrels primarily consume plant matter such as nuts and seeds, but they may occasionally eat small insects and nestling birds. In contrast, scorpions primarily feed on various insects and other small animals. If a squirrel and a scorpion were to fight, the outcome would be uncertain and would depend on factors like the size and species of the scorpion, as well as the squirrel's agility. A larger and more venomous scorpion might be able to sting the squirrel, possibly incapacitating or killing it. On the other hand, a smaller scorpion might not be able to harm the squirrel effectively, and the squirrel's agility and quick reflexes could allow it to escape or fend off the scorpion. In the second question, the scenario involves a squirrel and a frog, two animals that generally do not pose a threat to one another. Squirrels rarely feed on frogs, and frogs usually eat insects and small aquatic organisms. In a confrontation, the squirrel's speed and agility could give it an advantage, as it could dodge the frog's tongue and avoid its grasp. On the other hand, some frogs possess potent toxins that can deter or harm potential predators, which could work to the frog's advantage. However, as mentioned earlier, these animals are not natural enemies and would not typically engage in a fight. In conclusion, these two questions are not the same as they involve different animals and scenarios. The outcomes of these hypothetical confrontations would depend on various factors such as the size, species, and defensive strategies of the animals involved."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They break the rules and do not care about the property of the writer. Read the following context and answer the question. Context: Before we got married my husband and I lived in 4 different apartments all within the span of one year. The worst one of all of them was actually a great apartment, but our upstairs neighbors drove us positively insane. A list of their common antics: Blasting movies/music with the bass turned all the way up into the small hours of the morning, in their bedroom, which was directly above our bedroom Stomping, all day, every day, no matter what, always stomping. Sometimes running full speed around their apartment. It was a 1 bedroom and they had at least 4 adults (two couples) and at least 2 kids living there. They also always had company over. It was a nonsmoking complex but they smoked on their porch and tossed their butts over their balcony, which would leave them landing in our little porch. Constantly came out to find butts and trash in our potted plants and all over the ground. We had to call the sheriff on them once because one of the couples living there got in a very loud, very obvious domestic violence situation. We heard them screaming and throwing each other around. At one point the man smashed her head through the wall. The kicker was when they brought home one of those mini motorcycles and put it out on their porch. Their porch was made of slatted wood so there were gaps between the boards. The damn bike started leaking fuel (racing fuel no less) through the slats and on our porch (and all over our stuff). Ruined a table, some laundry I had air-drying out there and killed a few of our plants. Not only that but while this was happening they were throwing their butts down onto our porch too. Could have started a fire. Then there was the spitting. They would spit over the edge of their balcony and we complained so they started spitting THROUGH the floor boards so it was definitely intentional. I have never experienced a more trashy group of people. So glad to be out of that apartment and away from them now. Question: How does the writer feel about the stability of the family living above? Answer: Answer:","completion":"Based on the context provided, the writer feels that the family living above them is unstable. This can be inferred from the series of actions and behaviors exhibited by the upstairs neighbors, which include: 1. Excessive noise from blasting movies/music with the bass turned up late into the night. 2. Constant stomping, running, and loud sounds from their apartment throughout the day. 3. Overcrowded living situation with at least four adults and two children in a one-bedroom apartment. 4. Disregard for the nonsmoking policy of the complex and tossing cigarette butts onto the writer's porch. 5. A domestic violence incident that required the intervention of law enforcement. 6. Carelessness resulting in property damage, potential fire hazards due to fuel leakage, and spitting on the writer's porch. These actions and behaviors indicate that the family living above is unstable, as they struggle to maintain a peaceful and orderly living environment. Their frequent rule-breaking, carelessness, and dangerous actions further demonstrate a disregard for the property and well-being of others, which supports the writer's view of their instability."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - vaporate - cool off - form crystals - melt - keep things cold Explain why a human would choose \\"melt\\" to answer the question above: A:","completion":"A human would choose \\"melt\\" to answer the question above because when ice is not ice anymore, it typically means that the solid ice has gone through a phase transition due to an increase in temperature, causing it to change its state from solid to liquid. This process is known as melting. In essence, the temperature change allows the ice's molecules to gain more energy, vibrating at faster rates and essentially breaking the bonds that held them rigidly together in the solid state. As a result, the solid ice turns into liquid water. Now let's briefly explain why the other options are not the correct answer: 1. Vaporate: This option likely refers to 'evaporate' or the process of turning into vapor from the liquid state. For ice, it directly turning into vapor is referred to as 'sublimation' but that's not the process described in the question since it would still be ice. 2. Cool off: Cooling off would mean a decrease in temperature. In order for ice to stop being ice, it would need to gain heat, not lose it. 3. Form crystals: While ice itself is a crystalline structure, the question is asking about what happens when ice is not ice anymore — the ice would need to undergo a phase change, like melting, rather than forming more crystals. 4. Keep things cold: This does not describe a change in the state of the ice itself but rather the function ice serves when used to lower the temperature of other objects. To sum it up, a human would choose \\"melt\\" because it best explains the phase change from solid to liquid when ice is not ice anymore."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It was quite a blow for me , from what I am hearing she is doing better but it is still too soon to tell . Then to make matters even better my HD crashed on my desktop at home , we are waiting for a replacement drive , but I still have homework to do and its causing some issues there as well . Question What will likely happen before Christmas ? Answer:","completion":"It is challenging to predict the exact events that will occur before Christmas, as many variables are in play. However, I can provide potential scenarios and general insights based on the information provided. 1. Regarding your grandmother's health: It is essential to communicate regularly with the hospital staff and get updates on her condition. Sometimes, a patient's health can improve unexpectedly, even when the prognosis seems bleak. Keep in touch with her medical team and make sure to be emotionally supportive for your grandmother. Be prepared for any outcome, but also hope for the best and spend as much time with her as you can. Before Christmas, there might be a few possible scenarios: a. Your grandmother's health could continue to improve, and she may be able to come home or be transferred to a rehabilitation facility where she can receive appropriate care and start recovering. b. Her health might remain stable, neither improving nor deteriorating. In this case, her condition could be monitored more closely by the medical staff, and they will try to make necessary adjustments in her treatment plan to enhance her well-being. c. Your grandmother's health could worsen, in which case the medical staff will focus on providing her with the best possible care and ensuring her comfort. It is important to discuss her wishes and preferences about her care with her and the medical team, such as considering palliative or hospice care if necessary. 2. As for your desktop computer and the hard drive issues: Once the replacement hard drive arrives, you will need to either reinstall the operating system (if you had installation or recovery media) or work with a technician or a knowledgeable friend to help you get your computer up and running again. Before Christmas, there might be a few possible outcomes: a. The replacement drive arrives soon, and you successfully reinstall the operating system and necessary software. You are then able to catch up on your homework and continue working without major issues. b. The replacement drive takes longer to arrive, or there are additional hardware or software issues that delay the computer's repair. In this case, explore alternative options to complete your homework. You could use the computers at your school library, borrow a friend's laptop, or look into affordable temporary solutions such as renting a laptop. c.

If it weren't for the fact that Jesse has a slightly darker skin complexion you wouldn't be able to tell them apart. In fact one year Matt was out in the sun for a long time and picked up a bit of a tan so they actually did look exactly alike. But I can use this background: The epidermis also contains melanocytes , which are cells that produce melanin. Melanin is the brownish pigment that gives skin much of its color. Everyone has about the same number of melanocytes, but the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The amount of melanin produced is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light, which increases melanin output. Exposure to UV light also stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D . Because melanin blocks UV light from penetrating the skin, people with darker skin may be at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency. What is an answer for this question: Which persons melanocytes produce more melanin, Matt or Jesse? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, Jesse's melanocytes produce more melanin than Matt's. This conclusion can be drawn from observing the natural skin color of the two individuals. The color of a person's skin is largely determined by the activity of the melanocytes, these are the cells in the epidermis (the outermost layer of the skin) that produce melanin. Melanin is a pigment that provides the color of a person's skin, hair, and eyes. Those with a darker skin tone have melanocytes that produce more melanin, while those with a lighter skin tone have melanocytes that produce less melanin. In the case of Matt and Jesse, who are identical twins, they have the same number of melanocytes because they share identical genetic makeup. However, the way these melanocytes function may vary. From your description, Jesse has a darker skin complexion than Matt, indicating that Jesse's melanocytes naturally produce more melanin. However, your description also includes a scenario where Matt's skin became temporarily darker because he was out in the sun for a long time. This occurred because exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light – such as from the sun – stimulates melanocytes to increase their production of melanin as a way to protect the skin from UV damage. This resulted in a tan, or temporary darkening of Matt's skin, but it doesn't alter his melanocytes' usual production levels of melanin. So, even though Matt's skin darkened temporarily due to exposure to the sun, that doesn't change the fact that under normal circumstances (without excessive sun exposure), Jesse's melanocytes produce more melanin than those of Matt. However, it should be noted that individuals with darker skin, like Jesse, may be at a greater risk of vitamin D deficiency. This is because melanin blocks UV light – the very same light needed by the skin to produce vitamin D. Thus, Jesse needs to ensure he gets enough sunlight for adequate vitamin D synthesis without increasing his risk of skin damage from the sun. In conclusion, Jesse's melanocytes produce more melanin than Matt's, based on their normal skin color. This could change temporarily with significant sun exposure, as experienced by Matt, but their inherent melanin production levels remain the same."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The premise focuses on describing a situation or event as nightmarish, which implies that it is horrifying, dreadful, or bothersome. This could range from a relatively minor inconvenience to a significantly distressing occurrence. On the other hand, the hypothesis \\"This reminded me of many past tragedies\\" indicates that the situation at hand bears resemblance to previous unfortunate events in the speaker's life or experience. This statement conveys a sense of repetition or recurrence, something that evokes memories of prior instances of suffering or misfortune. These two statements could indeed be related, as a \\"nightmare\\" scenario could potentially remind someone of past tragedies. However, simply knowing that the premise is true does not automatically confirm the hypothesis is true as well. The two statements could also describe different aspects or perspectives of a distressing situation and may or may not be related to one another.

Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that killed the king of the people that had a limited measure of independence? , can you please find it? Pulakeshin II conquered the eastern Deccan, corresponding to the coastal districts of modern Andhra Pradesh in 616, defeating the remnants of the Vishnukundina kingdom. He appointed his brother Kubja Vishnuvardhana as Viceroy in 621. Thus the Eastern Chalukyas were originally of Kannada stock. After the death of Pulakeshin II, the Vengi Viceroyalty developed into an independent kingdom and included the region between Nellore and Visakhapatnam.After the decline of the Badami Chalukya empire in the mid-8th century, territorial disputes flared up between the Rashtrakutas, the new rulers of the western deccan, and the Eastern Chalukyas. For much of the next two centuries, the Eastern Chalukyas had to accept subordination towards the Rashtrakutas. Apart from a rare military success, such as the one by Vijayaditya II(c.808–847), it was only during the rule of Bhima I (c.892–921) that these Chalukyas were able to celebrate a measure of independence. After the death of Bhima I, the Andhra region once again saw succession disputes and interference in Vengi affairs by the Rashtrakutas.The fortunes of the Eastern Chalukyas took a turn around 1000. Danarnava, their king, was killed in battle in 973 by the Telugu Choda King Bhima who then imposed his rule over the region for twenty-seven years. During this time, Danarnava's two sons took refuge in the Chola kingdom. Choda Bhima's invasion of Tondaimandalam, a Chola territory, and his subsequent death on the battlefield opened up a new era in Chola–Chalukya relations. Saktivarman I, the elder son of Danarnava was crowned as the ruler of Vengi in 1000, though under the control of king Rajaraja Chola I. This new relationship between the Cholas and the coastal Andhra kingdom was unacceptable to the Western Chalukyas, who had by then replaced the Rashtrakutas as the main power in the western Deccan. The Western Chalukyas sought to brook the growing Chola influence in the Vengi region but were unsuccessful.Initially, the Eastern Chalukyas had encouraged Kannada language and...

The balloon falls much slower than the boulder meaning it (A) weighs more (B) weighs less A:","completion":"The balloon falls much slower than the boulder, meaning it (B) weighs less. When Bill throws a boulder and a balloon, the difference in their falling speed is due to their weights and the effect of air resistance. The weight of an object depends on its mass and the acceleration due to gravity. Balloons are typically filled with air or lighter-than-air gases like helium, and they have thin material encasing. Boulder, on the other hand, is made of dense, heavy rock. Due to their significant difference in mass, the balloon will weigh less compared to the boulder. Additionally, the air resistance acting on the balloon is higher relative to its weight because of its larger surface area compared to the boulder. It causes the balloon to experience an upward force that counteracts the force of gravity, resulting in a slower fall. So, the correct answer is (B) the balloon weighs less."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

With no idea where to get those books, I was unlikely to find publications from nearly 200 nations on the shelves of my local bookshop, so I decided to ask the readers all over the world for help. I created a blog called A Year of Reading the World and put out an appeal for suggestions of titles that I could read in English. The response was amazing. People all over the world were getting in touch with me, offering ideas and book lists. Some posted me books from their home countries. In addition, several writers, like Turkmenistan's Ak Welsapar and Panama's Juan David Morgan, sent me unpublished translations of their novels, giving me a rare opportunity to read works unavailable in Britain. Even with such an extraordinary team of bibliophiles behind me, however, sourcing books was no easy task.

Available options: * yes. * it is not possible to tell. * no.","completion":"It is not possible to tell. The original statement, \\"A middle-aged man in a white boat untangles his fishing net,\\" provides some information about a specific scenario. It tells us the age of the man, the color of the boat, and his activity at the moment, which involves untangling a fishing net. However, this information on its own is not sufficient to ascertain the man's objective or expectations regarding the amount of fish he plans or hopes to catch. While it is reasonable to assume that the man might intend to catch fish using his net, since he is in a boat with a fishing net, there are factors that we would need to consider to evaluate his potential success in catching \\"a large load of fish.\\" For example, we have no details about the location of the boat (whether it is in an area abundant with fish), the man's experience as a fisherman, or if the net he is using is suitable for catching a significant amount of fish. Moreover, the original statement does not provide any information on the man's intentions or preferences; he could be out for a leisurely fishing trip without a concern for the number of fish he catches, or he could be teaching someone else how to use a fishing net. In conclusion, while it is likely that the man is preparing to fish, given that he is untangling his net, it is not possible to tell with certainty that his goal is to catch a large load of fish in his net. There are too many unknown factors and potential variables that could affect or alter his goal and his eventual success or failure in achieving it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In Puerto Rico she rubbed the island's flag between her legs on stage, resulting in outrage among the audience. In March 1994, she appeared as a guest on the Late Show with David Letterman, using profanity that required censorship on television, and handing Letterman a pair of her panties and asking him to smell it. The releases of her sexually explicit films, albums and book, and the aggressive appearance on Letterman all made critics question Madonna as a sexual renegade. Critics and fans reacted negatively, who commented that \\"she had gone too far\\" and that her career was over.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - gym - cub - home or office - istanbul - roon Answer:","completion":"The most suitable option for someone looking for new carpeting would be \\"home or office.\\" This is because carpeting is a versatile and common flooring solution that suits various spaces, and both homes and offices can greatly benefit from the comfort, warmth, and visual appeal that carpets provide. In residential spaces, carpeting can be installed in living rooms, bedrooms, hallways, stairs, and basements, among other areas. Carpets provide insulation, help with sound absorption, and provide a comfortable surface to walk, sit, or play on. Homeowners have a wide variety of carpet types, materials, colors, and designs to choose from, making it easy to find a carpet that complements their interior design preferences and needs. Similarly, carpets can also be a great addition to office spaces and commercial buildings. Carpeting in office environments contributes to creating a professional, cozy, and welcoming atmosphere for employees and visitors alike. In addition, carpet tiles, specifically designed for office spaces, offer benefits such as durability, easy maintenance, and the ability to replace individual tiles if they become damaged or stained. While gym spaces, clubs, or specific locations like Istanbul might have areas where carpeting could be utilized, these options are not as widely applicable as home or office spaces. Gyms, for instance, usually require flooring that is more resilient and easier to clean, such as rubber flooring or interlocking foam tiles. Similarly, clubs and entertainment venues often opt for hard-surface flooring for easy maintenance and durability; however, carpeted areas might be chosen for more exclusive and comfortable lounge spaces. In summary, home or office spaces are the most suitable option for new carpeting due to the wide range of applications, benefits, and the availability of diverse carpet designs catering to various aesthetic and functional requirements. Installing carpets can enhance the comfort, visual appeal, and insulation of both residential and commercial spaces, making it the most fitting choice from the given options."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Given the background: During late adulthood, the risk of developing diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer continues to rise. Most people also have a decline in strength and stamina. Their senses may start failing, and their reflex time typically increases. Their immune system also doesn’t work as well as it used to. As a result, common diseases like the flu may become more serious and even lead to death. The majority of late adults develop arthritis, and as many as one in four develop Alzheimer’s disease. and the situation: Margaret is a sophomore in high school who just started her Spring break. With a week off from school, her family is spending some time driving out of state to visit her grandma, Kathy, who has a cabin up in the snowy mountains. Margaret always enjoys spending time with her grandma because she has interesting stories and makes some of the best pie around. Also, they always go skiing when visiting the cabin so Margaret is excited for that. Answer the following question: Whose joints will be more sore after skiing? Answer:","completion":"After skiing, it is more likely that Kathy, the grandmother, will have more sore joints compared to Margaret. This is primarily because Kathy is in her late adulthood, making her more susceptible to age-related issues such as arthritis, a decline in strength and stamina, and an overall decrease in physical ability. In contrast, Margaret, as a high school sophomore, is younger and likely to have better joint health, strength, and stamina.

They were certainly right: Archaeologists are now confirming that it isn't just a ship, but perhaps the oldest found in the area, dating back to the 1700s, reports WBOC 16. Growth rings reveal it was made from oak cut down between the Potomac River and Annapolis and fastened with wooden pegs, reports WBAL-TV.

Their suspicions have now been confirmed by archaeologists, who not only verified that it is indeed a shipwreck, but also believe it to be the oldest found in the area, dating back to the 1700s. According to WBOC 16, the ship was constructed from oak trees cut down between the Potomac River and Annapolis. The shipwrights utilized wooden pegs as fastenings, as reported by WBAL-TV. Measurements indicate that the 45-foot cargo ship was likely built at a small shipyard or plantation in Maryland. Evidence of charring on the timbers suggests that British sympathizers set it ablaze during the turbulent 1780s.

The fairly realm Answer:","completion":"Title: \\"Enchanted Summons\\" Derek, a down-to-earth, pragmatic lawyer in a bustling city, lives a routine life filled with case files, courtrooms, and regulation court battles. One odd day, he receives a mysterious, gilded summons in the mail. The craftmanship is peculiarly old-world, and the language in the summons appears to be some ancient, arcane script which he can't identify, but for some reason, he can understand it clearly. The summons was from the Fairy Realm, a concept that is utterly ridiculous to his logical mind. The summons outlines that he has been chosen to represent a client from their world - Queen Titania, the Fairy Queen, who is facing a wrongful dethronement lawsuit in the Fairy Realm. Derek brushes it off as a well-orchestrated prank - until it happens again, and this time with a fairy, Astoria, effectively startling him in his office, confirming the summons' authenticity. Astoria, a fearless fairy lawyer working under Titania, manages to convince a bemused and bewildered Derek to embark on this extraordinary journey into the Fairy Realm - a world unbeknownst to most humans, brimming with wonder, magic, and dilemmas quite unlike human ones. Derek is skeptical and incredulous, causing both comedic and conflict-filled situations, but the commitment to his profession compels him to see this through. He wades through the labyrinth of fairy laws, their intricacies, and the astonishing magic-infused courtrooms, where he butts heads with Oberon, the Fairy King, who has initiated the lawsuit against Titania, his own wife. It's a high-stakes case, where the political structure, history, and future of the Fairy Realm lie delicately balanced. There are underlying threads of rebellion, manipulation, and deceit, all leading back to the duplicitous group of power-hungry fairies trying to overthrow Titania. Complementing the legal battle, Derek's character experiences an arc of growing from a rigid, often dismissive person, to someone who learns to appreciate magic, the unexplainable, and learning to trust his intuition. His dynamic with Astoria, who herself learns about the rigidity and structure of human laws from him, showcases a beautiful cultural and professional exchange. In the climax, Derek skillfully uses his logic, human wit, combined with fairy laws and magic taught by Astoria, to dismantle the accusations at the trial. The truth unfolds shockingly in the court, proving Queen Titania's innocence and unmasking the traitors among the court. Derek's successful defense restores Titania to her rightful throne, peace in the Fairy Realm, and the perpetrators are justly punished. Derek returns to his world, changed, humbled, and promising to keep the secret of the Fairy Realm. This whole unusual journey changes his perspective, not just on his profession but on life as well. His successful defense in the Fairy Realm makes him a fairy-tale legend, unbeknown to his human counterparts. However, in his heart, he now holds an irreplaceable respect for the Fae world and a secret ally in Astoria. The routine life he formerly led now glimmers with the enchanting remnants of his journey. The movie closes on Derek in his regular life with a knowing smile, hinting at the unseen adventures he had, redefining the world he knew. As confusing as the summons had appeared in the beginning, he is now grateful for being a part of the Fairy Realm, if only for a short while."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: The local anesthetic properties of tetrodotoxin, a potent naturally occurring sodium channel blocker, have been recently reexamined. It was found that sciatic nerve block duration could be greatly increased and systemic toxicity greatly decreased if epinephrine was injected with tetrodotoxin. The mechanism that underlies epinephrine-mediated prolongation of tetrodotoxin nerve blocks is not known, but indirect evidence suggests that epinephrine may slow the clearance of tetrodotoxin from the site of injection. The authors hypothesized that tetrodotoxin causes vasodilatation at its injection site, which accelerates its systemic uptake, and that this vasodilatation is attenuated by coinjected epinephrine.', 'The radiolabeled microsphere technique was used to measure tissue blood flow in anesthetized rats before and after perisciatic injection of tetrodotoxin alone and in combination with epinephrine.', 'Tetrodotoxin, in a dose of 0.1 ml of a 60 microM solution, significantly increased blood flow in perisciatic muscle at the injected side compared with simultaneous contralateral control and ipsilateral preinjection baseline. Tetrodotoxin did not increase blood flow in the sciatic nerve. Coinjection of epinephrine with tetrodotoxin prevented tetrodotoxin-induced increases in perisciatic muscle blood flow over time and did not alter sciatic nerve blood flow. Arterial blood pressure was maintained with this dose of tetrodotoxin, although brain blood flow decreased. Coinjection of epinephrine with tetrodotoxin prevented decreases in brain blood flow. Higher doses of tetrodotoxin produced hypotension.

Others never form heartwood.\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","completion":"The answer to the question \\"What is it called when the heart is decomposed and becomes heartwood?\\" is not explicitly stated in the given passage. However, the process of heartwood formation can be inferred from the passage. Heartwood forms as a tree's inner layers undergo changes, and in some species, this occurs even when the tree's heart is completely decayed. Although the term \\"decomposed\\" might not be the most accurate word to describe this process, the transformation of living sapwood to heartwood can be considered as the answer to the question."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

One day, Kayla fell into a very deep sleep, almost like a spell had been cast on her. Sarah wanted to help her friend wake up, but no matter what she did, Kayla just wouldn't open her eyes. That meant that Sarah needed to find a new way to help her friend. Sarah tried tickling Kayla's feet, shaking her gently, and even putting a funny-smelling flower under her nose, but none of those tricks worked. She thought long and hard about what could possibly wake her friend up from this magical sleep. Then, Sarah remembered hearing a story about a sleeping princess who could only be woken up with a special kiss. But Sarah thought, \\"I don't have any magical kisses! What else can I try?\\" She realized that maybe if she could find the source of the spell that put Kayla to sleep, she could break the spell and wake her up. Sarah went on a big adventure, searching high and low for the magical source. She climbed tall mountains, swam across deep rivers, and even went into a dark and mysterious forest. Along the way, she met many friendly animals who also wanted to help Kayla. There was a wise old owl, a helpful squirrel, and a brave little mouse. Together, they traveled through the forest in search of answers. Finally, after many days of searching, they stumbled upon a hidden cave. Inside the cave, they found a bright, glowing crystal guarded by a dragon! The wise old owl told Sarah that this crystal had the power to break Kayla's deep sleep spell. Sarah knew she had to be very brave to face the dragon and get the crystal. She gathered all her courage, and with the help of her new animal friends, they were able to distract the dragon long enough for Sarah to grab the crystal. With the crystal in hand, Sarah quickly returned to Kayla's side. She held the crystal up to the sunlight, making it sparkle and shine brightly. As the light from the crystal touched Kayla's face, the spell began to fade away. All of a sudden, Kayla started to stir and slowly opened her eyes. She saw Sarah and their animal friends standing around her, and she knew they had saved her from the deep sleep spell. Kayla hugged Sarah tightly, thankful to have such a caring friend who never gave up on her. And from that day on, Sarah and Kayla knew that there was nothing they couldn't face together, as long as they had each other and the help of their new animal friends. And they all lived happily ever after."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

The structure that Adam was in was more unstable than that of Aaron's because Options: (A). Adam was in a modern building.; (B). Aaron was in a modern building.;","completion":"The structure that Adam was in was more unstable than that of Aaron's because Adam was in a modern building (Option A), while Aaron was in a modern building (Option B). The difference in stability between the two structures might seem counterintuitive; one might expect a modern building to have better construction and materials, leading to increased stability. However, various factors can cause a modern building to be less stable than an older one. Step 1: Consider the design and architectural elements of both structures. Modern buildings often prioritize aesthetics and functionality over stability. This can result in large glass windows, open floor plans, and thin walls that may not provide the same level of structural stability as older, more traditional buildings. In contrast, older buildings might have thicker walls, smaller windows, and dense structural support systems, all designed to maintain the building's stability. Aaron's older building, therefore, may be more stable due to these architectural differences. Step 2: Assess the construction materials used in both structures. Modern building materials like synthetic composites, lightweight steel, and glass might not be as robust as traditional materials like stone, brick, and timber. Additionally, modern construction techniques could lead to shortcuts or cost-cutting measures that compromise the building's structural integrity. Aaron's older building, built with traditional materials and methods, might have improved durability and stability, while Adam's modern building may be at a disadvantage. Step 3: Evaluate the location and surrounding environment of both structures. Geographical factors like soil quality, earthquakes, and flood risks can significantly affect a building's stability. A building's design and materials may not adequately account for these factors, leading to less stable structures over time. If Adam's modern building is in an area prone to geological risks, it could face more significant instability compared to Aaron's building. Aaron might be in a more structurally sound location, allowing his building to maintain better stability. Step 4: Examine the maintenance and upkeep history of both structures. Regardless of a building's age, regular maintenance and inspections are vital to ensure its stability and safety. If Adam's modern building has a history of poor maintenance, it may be more unstable than Aaron's older building if it has been well-maintained and regularly inspected. In conclusion, the structural stability of a building can depend on various factors such as its design, construction materials, location, and maintenance. Despite being a modern building, Adam's structure may be more unstable than Aaron's older building because of these factors. This highlights the importance of considering all aspects of a building's construction, materials, and upkeep when assessing stability."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

However, by analyzing the given sentence, we can deduce that the product (which could be a game, toy, or another related item) was released in 1997. Based on this information, one might infer that the second generation of Digimon could have been released around the same time, although the sentence does not make this connection explicitly clear.

Write an article based on this summary: – A rape case in Colorado has strong echoes of the Brock Turner case at Stanford in the defendant's behavior, the victim's powerful statement—and the controversial light sentence. Former University of Colorado student Austin James Wilkerson, 22, was spared a sentence in state prison Wednesday after he was found guilty of sexually assaulting an intoxicated female student after a St. Patrick's Day party in 2014, the Guardian reports. Instead, Wilkerson—who told the freshman student's friends that he was going to look after her—will be on probation for 20 years to life and will serve two years in the county jail under a work-release program that will allow him to leave jail for school or work every day. Prosecutors—who said Wilkerson \\"raped a helpless young woman after duping the people around her into believing he was going to care for her\\"—wanted prison, but the judge used his discretion to give him a sentence lighter than the four to 12 years in state prison the charge usually carries, the Daily Camera reports. His victim told the court that she still suffers from nightmares and panic attacks. \\"Worst of all is the victim blaming,\\" she said. \\"'If I hadn't been drunk, this wouldn't have happened. If I hadn't gotten separated, this wouldn't have happened.'

Background Wilkerson had told the freshman student's friends he was going to look after her following a St. Patrick's Day party. However, instead of protecting her, he took advantage of her vulnerability. Prosecutors, who demanded prison time, stated that Wilkerson \\"raped a helpless young woman after duping the people around her into believing he was going to care for her.\\" The Sentence Despite prosecutors’ pleas, the judge used his discretion to give Wilkerson a significantly lighter sentence than the four to 12 years in state prison the charge usually carries. Instead, he will be on probation for 20 years to life and serve two years in the county jail under a work-release program, allowing him to leave jail for school or work each day. Victim's Statement The young victim, who still grapples with nightmares and panic attacks as a result of the assault, addressed the court. In a powerful statement, she shared the struggles of coping with victim-blaming and the mental anguish that follows. She challenged the excuse that her attacker was drunk, which she believes contributed to his lenient sentence, and implored the judge to \\"have as much mercy for the rapist as he did for me that night.\\" Conclusion This Colorado case has sparked outrage, drawing comparisons to the controversial light sentence handed down in the Stanford assault case involving Brock Turner. Both cases share similarities in the defendant's behavior, the victim's powerful statement, and the subsequent controversy surrounding the legal handling of the situations."},{"prompt":"Combine facts and answer this: Are both literary figures, Lorraine Hansberry and Ann-Marie MacDonald, from the same country?

Let's break down this statement to further understand the situation and the relation between window washers and people working outdoors. \\"Window washers\\" refers to individuals or professionals who clean and maintain windows, typically on the exteriors of buildings. This may involve an array of equipment ranging from ladders, scaffolding, window washing tools, and in some cases, harnesses to ensure safety while working at great heights. In the given statement, the window washers are \\"outside a Chinese restaurant.\\" This provides two essential pieces of information: 1. The location: The statement indicates that the workers are operating outside, which means they are exposed to the elements and in an outdoor environment. 2. The type of establishment: In this case, the window washers are working on a Chinese restaurant's exterior. While this detail does not directly contribute to understanding whether these individuals are working outdoors, it adds context to the situation. Considering this information, it can be concluded that there are people working outdoors. Since window washing, by definition, involves cleaning and maintaining windows, this task is often carried out in outdoor settings. Furthermore, the fact that these window washers are outside a Chinese restaurant further reaffirms their outdoor presence. In summary, given the information provided, stating that the window washers are outside a Chinese restaurant allows us to logically infer that there are indeed people working outdoors. The outdoor nature of this work, coupled with the clear indication of their location, supports this conclusion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Here are possible answers to this question: - pleasure - delight - bankruptcy - agony - owning I believe the correct choice is \\"agony\\", here's why: Answer:","completion":"The correct choice indeed is \\"agony\\", and there are a few reasons that support this conclusion. Firstly, let us briefly analyze each of the given options to understand why \\"agony\\" is the most appropriate choice in this context. 1. Pleasure: This option doesn't align with John's situation as he is purchasing products for his swollen testicles, which indicates that he is experiencing discomfort or pain. Pleasure would imply that he is enjoying the situation, which is not the case here. 2. Delight: Similar to pleasure, this choice also goes against the context of the question. Delight implies satisfaction or joy, whereas John's actions of spending money on products for his condition suggest that he is trying to alleviate his distress. 3. Bankruptcy: This option refers to the financial state of an individual who cannot repay their debts, and it does not represent an emotion or sensation that John is feeling. Considering that the question concerns John's feelings as a reason to buy these products, bankruptcy is not a suitable answer here. 4. Agony: Agony is defined as extreme physical or mental suffering and matches the context of John's situation. As he is experiencing discomfort from his swollen testicles and spending money to alleviate his suffering, agony is the emotion that he is feeling, making it the most appropriate choice. 5. Owning: This option refers to the act of possessing or having control over something. It is not an emotion or sensation related to John's experience and therefore not a suitable answer to this question. Taking the above points into consideration, it becomes clear that \\"agony\\" is the correct choice in this context. John's decision to spend a significant amount of money on products for his swollen testicles is driven by the pain and suffering that he's experiencing. By purchasing these products, he aims to find relief and alleviate his discomfort, which characterizes the emotion of agony.

Answer:","completion":"Question: How did the discovery of Saint Helena by Sir Francis Drake and subsequent visits by other English explorers impact the trade and shipping routes of the Portuguese and Spanish in the late 16th century? Answer: The discovery of Saint Helena by Englishman Sir Francis Drake during his circumnavigation of the world (1577-1580) led to increasing visits by other English explorers. As Saint Helena's location became more widely known, English ships of war started to wait in the area to ambush Portuguese India carracks returning home. This strategic positioning disrupted the trade and shipping routes of the Portuguese and Spanish. Additionally, the Dutch began frequenting the island to develop their Far East trade, which added to the pressure on the Portuguese and Spanish ships. Consequently, the Portuguese and Spanish stopped regularly calling at the island for several reasons. One reason was their preference for ports along the West African coast, which may have been a strategic move to avoid the threat posed by the English and Dutch presence at Saint Helena. Another reason was the hostile action taken against their vessels, as well as the desecration of their religious sites, such as chapels and icons. Furthermore, Dutch and English sailors were responsible for the destruction of Portuguese and Spanish livestock and plantation on the island. Ultimately, the discovery of Saint Helena by Sir Francis Drake and subsequent visits by other English and Dutch explorers significantly impacted the trade and shipping routes of the Portuguese and Spanish in the late 16th century, forcing them to adapt to the changing geopolitical landscape."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Both types can grow in either the pole- or bush-style, but the pods of the beans are what make them unique. Shell beans are primarily removed from their pod to be eaten, and are consumed fresh or dried to save for later. Snap beans are eaten inside their pod, and are only eaten fresh (not dried for later use). You can grow multiple styles of these beans directly adjacent to one another, because bean plants are self-pollinating and won’t cross-contaminate each other. Popular shell beans include black beans, fava beans, black-eyed peas, garbanzo beans, and kidney beans. Popular snap beans include snap (green) beans, adzuki beans, mung beans, asparagus beans, and scarlet-runner beans. Pole beans are a type of beans that are vining and must be supported with a trellis or pole. Pole beans grow an average of 5- to 6-feet tall, and can grow either shell or snap bean. Pole beans generally thrive in cooler summer temperatures, as low as 50 °F (10 °C) in the summer. In the US, they thrive in the northern states. You can use whatever support system (trellis, pole, fence, arbor, etc.) that you want for pole beans. Bush beans are a type of beans that grow in off a bush, and do not need a trellis or pole for support. Generally, bush beans grow best in warm environments with summer temperatures reaching above 100 °F (38 °C). In the US, they thrive in the Southern states. Bush beans should be planted in large rows, requiring much more space than pole beans. A variety of bush beans called ‘half-runners’ is a bush/pole hybrid, and may require some support or placement near a fence for stabilization.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Striking Hollywood writers will be back at their keyboards Wednesday after voting overwhelmingly to end a 100-day walkout that essentially shut down the entertainment industry. Writers Guild of America member Steven Binder shows his approval as he votes Tuesday in Beverly Hills, California. More than 92 percent of the Writers Guild of America members who cast ballots Tuesday in Los Angeles and New York voted to end their work stoppage over residuals for writing in the digital age, including new media and the Internet. The new deal is for three years. \\"The strike is over. Our membership has voted, and writers can go back to work,\\" said Patric Verrone, president of the WGA's West chapter. Michael Winship, president of WGA's East guild, said, \\"The success of this strike is a significant achievement not only for ourselves but the entire creative community, now and in the future.\\" WGA members walked off the job November 5 after talks broke down over how writers are paid for the use of their material on the Internet and DVDs, among other issues. \\"It is not all that we hoped for, and it is not all we deserve,\\" Verrone said when a tentative deal was announced Saturday. But he added, \\"This is the best deal this guild has bargained for in 30 years.\\" Leslie Moonves, chief executive officer of CBS Corp., told The Associated Press, \\"At the end of the day, everybody won. \\"It was a fair deal and one that the companies can live with, and it recognizes the large contribution that writers have made to the industry.\\" The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which represents production companies and media conglomerates, has had no comment on the agreement. The vote meant that the Academy Awards ceremony on February 24 will be the usual scripted gala, the AP reported. \\"I am ecstatic that the 80th Academy Awards presentation can now proceed full steam ahead,\\" without \\"hesitation or discomfort\\" for the nominees, Sid Ganis, president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which stages the Oscars, told the AP. As long as the strike continued, the traditional Oscars spectacular was in doubt since many Hollywood stars would not cross WGA picket lines. It's unclear how soon new episodes of scripted programs will start appearing, because production won't begin until scripts are completed, the AP reported. It will take at least four weeks for producers to get the first post-strike episodes of comedies back on the air; dramas will take six to eight weeks, the AP said. Verrone said the WGA achieved two of three goals through negotiations with the studios. Watch Verrone explain what he thinks the strike accomplished ». The first goal relates to writers' \\"jurisdiction\\" in new media, Verrone said, meaning that any content written by guild members specifically for new media, such as the Internet or cell phones, will be covered by their contract. The second goal relates to reuse of content in new media, Verrone said. The agreement bases payment for reuses on a distributor's gross formula for residuals, \\"so that when they get paid, we get paid,\\" he said. It is the \\"first time in our history that a new delivery system pays on a residual formula superior to the prior existing system,\\" Verrone said. The third goal, which Verrone said the guild did not achieve, was to shore up writers' shares of the revenue from animation and reality television. \\"Giving up animation and reality was a heartbreaking thing for me personally,\\" he said. \\"But it was more important that we make a deal that benefited the membership, the town as a whole, that got people back to work and that solved the biggest problems in new media.\\" E-mail to a friend.

Please answer the following question: Process: - The air is cold - Water is in the air - The water forms tiny ice crystals - The ice crystals collide with each other - The ice crystals stick to each other - The ice crystals get bigger as more of them stick together - The ice crystals get too heavy to be in the air - The ice crystals become snowflakes - The snow flakes fall to the ground as snow. Question: suppose there is less cloud cover happens, how will it affect LESS snow. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","completion":"B: Less To understand this answer, it is essential to first grasp the entire process of snow formation as outlined in the initial statement, and then to analyze how the presence of less cloud cover impacts each stage of the process. Snow forms through a series of steps that require specific atmospheric conditions to converge. The process commences when cold air, containing water vapor, cools to the point where tiny ice crystals start to form. Subsequently, these ice crystals interact and combine as they move through the air, eventually growing larger and amassing more ice particles. As this aggregation of ice crystals continues and becomes too unwieldy to stay in the atmosphere, snowflakes are generated. This results in the snowfall that reaches the ground. Cloud cover plays an integral role in the formation of snow. Clouds consist of water vapor, which is the essential ingredient for snow production. Clouds can also act as an insulator, trapping energy that keeps temperatures below the clouds colder. This aids in maintaining the optimal conditions for snow formation. Consequently, less cloud cover will have a direct impact on the amount of snowfall. Firstly, fewer clouds reduce the volume of water vapor available in the atmosphere. This directly impacts the earliest stages of the process, where ice crystals rely on atmospheric water vapor to develop. Secondly, decreased cloud cover also means there is less insulation to keep heat trapped, leading to warmer temperatures at ground level. This rise in temperature hinders the preservation of optimal conditions for snow formation, as temperatures must remain below freezing for ice crystals to form and accumulate. As a result, less cloud cover creates less favorable conditions for the formation and sustainment of snow. Reduced water vapor in the atmosphere and elevated temperatures at ground level both work against the process of creating snowfall. Thus, the correct answer is B: Less. With less cloud cover present, less snow will be produced."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Another disadvantage is on mixed flight deck operations where helicopters are also present such as a US Landing Helicopter Dock or Landing Helicopter Assault amphibious assault ship a ski jump is not included as this would eliminate one or more helicopter landing areas, this flat deck limits the loading of Harriers but is somewhat mitigated by the longer rolling start provided by a long flight deck compared to many STOVL carriers.

Your task is to generate answer for given question based on set of context paragraphs and supporting facts. Context_1 : Maverick is a steel roller coaster built by Intamin at Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio, United States. It was the seventeenth roller coaster built at the park since Blue Streak in 1964. It is notable as being the 500th roller coaster designed by German engineer Werner Stengel and the first roller coaster featuring a Twisted Horseshoe Roll. Maverick's US21-million price tag makes it Cedar Point's fourth most expensive roller coaster, behind Millennium Force, Top Thrill Dragster, and GateKeeper. The 4450 ft course makes it the fourth longest roller coaster at Cedar Point. Context_2 : Hades 360 is the name of a wooden roller coaster located at Mt. Olympus Water & Theme Park in Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin. It was originally known as Hades before the 360 degree roll was added in 2013. It is the largest roller coaster in the park. Hades 360 is a rarity among wooden roller coasters due to its 360 degree roll, 110-degree over banked turn, steep 65-degree drop as well as its 90-degree banked turn, as drops and angles this steep are generally not included on wooden roller coasters due to structural limitations. The ride was designed by The Gravity Group. Context_3 : Leviathan is a steel roller coaster in the Medieval Faire section of the park at Canada's Wonderland in Vaughan, Ontario, Canada. It is the first roller coaster designed by Swiss firm Bolliger & Mabillard to exceed a height of 300 ft , putting it in a class of roller coasters commonly referred to as \\"giga\\". At 5486 ft long, 306 ft tall, and with a top speed of 92 mph , Leviathan is the tallest and fastest roller coaster in Canada. s of 2015 , Leviathan is ranked as the eighth-tallest, and the eighth-fastest roller coaster in the world, and the third-tallest traditional lift-style coaster in the world. It was the 16th roller coaster to be built at Canada's Wonderland, and the ride's track was completed in February 2012, with the first test run being completed on 15 March 2012. The coaster opened to season pass holders on 27 April 2012, and to the general public on 6 May 2012. Context_4 : Ravine Flyer II is a hybrid wooden roller coaster located at Waldameer Park in Erie, Pennsylvania, United States. It was ranked as the best new ride of 2008 by Amusement Today Magazine. The \\"Ravine Flyer II\\" took place of the park's old Ravine Flyer, which was removed in 1938 due to a tragedy resulting in a man's death. Initial concepts for the replacement ride were developed by Custom Coasters International in the early 1990s, further developed by Dennis McNulty several years later, then finalized and constructed by The Gravity Group with Jeff Mason overseeing construction. Context_5 : A wooden roller coaster is most often classified as a roller coaster with running rails made of flattened steel strips mounted on laminated wooden track. Occasionally, the support structure may be made out of a steel lattice or truss, but the ride remains classified as a wooden roller coaster due to the track design. Because of the limits of wood, wooden roller coasters, in general, do not have inversions (when the coaster goes upside down), steep drops, or extremely banked turns (overbanked turns). However, there are exceptions; the defunct Son of Beast at Kings Island had a 214 ft drop and originally had a 90 ft loop until the end of the 2006 season, although the loop had steel supports. Other special cases are Hades 360 at Mount Olympus Water and Theme Park in Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin. The coaster features a double-track tunnel, a corkscrew, and a 90-degree banked turn. There is also The Voyage at Holiday World (an example of a wooden roller coaster with a steel structure for supports) featuring three separate 90-degree banked turns. Ravine Flyer II at Waldameer Park has a 90-degree banked turn, T Express at Everland in South Korea with a 77-degree drop, and Outlaw Run at Silver Dollar City which has 3 inversions and 120-degree overbanked turn. Context_6 : White Cyclone (ホワイトサイクロン , Howaito Saikuron ) is a wooden roller coaster at Nagashima Spa Land in Mie Prefecture, Japan. At 1700 m in length, White Cyclone is the third longest wooden roller coaster in the world, and is the longest wooden roller coaster outside of the United States. Despite its length, White Cyclone is still considerably shorter than the 2479 m Steel Dragon 2000, the world's longest steel roller coaster, which is also at Nagashima Spa Land. In addition to being the third longest wooden roller coaster, White Cyclone is the seventh tallest wooden roller coaster in the world and the fourth tallest wooden roller coaster outside the United States. A single ride on the White Cyclone costs ¥1,000 (approximately 9 USD), and the ride is restricted to those individuals above 1.3 m in height; and those individuals under 54 years of age. Context_7 : Blue Streak is a wooden roller coaster built in 1937 at Conneaut Lake Park in Conneaut Lake, Pennsylvania. It is the only wooden coaster operating in the park and the biggest. Blue Streak follows an out and back design. It is the 17th oldest wooden roller coaster in the United States, and it is one of two shallow coasters designed by Ed Vettel still operating. The second is The Cyclone at Lakeside Amusement Park in Denver, Colorado. This Blue Streak at Conneaut Lake Park first opened in 1938. The layout of the Blue Streak is very simple out and back style roller coaster. The trains immediately enters a tunnel in the shape of an 'S\\" and enters a 77 foot high climb up the lift hill. The train plummets down the first drop reaching up to top speed of 50 Mph and into a flat section. The flat section is followed by 2 medium size hills, then a wide turnaround section. After the turnaround, there is the uphill turn. The uphill turn slams riders against their seat. The train then follows 4 smaller camel back hills, providing airtime, then entering the break run and making a 360 degree turn back into the platform/station. Context_8 : Green Lantern Coaster is a steel roller coaster at Warner Bros. Movie World on the Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia. The ride is themed after DC Comics' Green Lantern and is located within the park's DC Comics superhero hub. The ride is an El Loco roller coaster manufactured by S&S Worldwide, characterised by a tight circuit featuring a beyond-vertical drop and an outward banked turn. It holds the record for the steepest drop of any roller coaster in the Southern Hemisphere, and the second steepest in the world. \\"Green Lantern Coaster\\" officially opened on 23 December 2011. Context_9 : Millennium Force is a steel roller coaster built by Intamin at Cedar Point amusement park in Sandusky, Ohio, United States. It was the fourteenth roller coaster to be built at the park since Blue Streak opened in 1964. Upon completion in 2000, Millennium Force broke six world records and was the world's first Giga Coaster, a roller coaster that exceeds 300 ft in height and completes a full circuit. It was briefly the tallest and fastest in the world until Steel Dragon 2000 opened later the same year. The ride is also the third-longest roller coaster in North America after The Beast at Kings Island and Fury 325 at Carowinds. It was the first roller coaster to use a cable lift system rather than a traditional chain lift. The coaster has a 310 ft , 45-degree lift hill with a 300 ft drop and features two tunnels, three overbanked turns, and four hills. It has a top speed of 93 mph . Context_10 : Tatsu is a steel flying roller coaster designed by Bolliger & Mabillard at the Six Flags Magic Mountain amusement park located in Valencia, California, United States. Announced on November 17, 2005, the roller coaster opened to the public on May 13, 2006 as the park's seventeenth roller coaster. Tatsu reaches a height of 170 ft and speeds up to 62 mph . The ride's name means \\"Flying Beast\\" in Japanese. The roller coaster is also the world's tallest and fastest flying coaster; is the only flying roller coaster to feature a zero-gravity roll; and has the world's highest pretzel loop. It was the world's longest flying coaster until The Flying Dinosaur surpassed it. fact_1 : Ravine Flyer II is a hybrid wooden roller coaster located at Waldameer Park in Erie, Pennsylvania, United States. fact_2 : A wooden roller coaster is most often classified as a roller coaster with running rails made of flattened steel strips mounted on laminated wooden track. fact_3 : Ravine Flyer II at Waldameer Park has a 90-degree banked turn, T Express at Everland in South Korea with a 77-degree drop, and Outlaw Run at Silver Dollar City which has 3 inversions and 120-degree overbanked turn.

Answer the following question: Given the background: Alpine tundra occurs at high enough altitude at any latitude. Portions of montane grasslands and shrublands ecoregions worldwide include alpine tundra. Large regions of alpine tundra occur in the North American Cordillera, the Alps and Pyrenees of Europe, the Himalaya and Karakoram of Asia, the Andes of South America, and the Eastern Rift mountains of Africa.Alpine tundra occupies high-mountain summits, slopes, and ridges above timberline. Aspect plays a role as well; the treeline often occurs at higher elevations on warmer equator-facing slopes. Because the alpine zone is present only on mountains, much of the landscape is rugged and broken, with rocky, snowcapped peaks, cliffs, and talus slopes, but also contains areas of gently rolling to almost flat topography.Averaging over many locations and local microclimates, the treeline rises 75 metres (245 ft) when moving 1 degree south from 70 to 50°N, and 130 metres (430 ft) per degree from 50 to 30°N. Between 30°N and 20°S, the treeline is roughly constant, between 3,500 and 4,000 metres (11,500 and 13,100 ft). and the situation: Gill and Ann were two fellow botanists. Gill studied alpine tundras extensively, while Ann studied tropical forests. They both discovered very interesting facts about nature and plants. Answer the following question: Which person learned less about shrublands ecoregions? Answer:","completion":"Ann, who studied tropical forests, likely learned less about shrublands ecoregions compared to Gill, who studied alpine tundras. This is because alpine tundra is a part of montane grasslands and shrublands ecoregions, whereas tropical forests are a separate type of ecosystem and not typically associated with shrublands ecoregions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The survey was asked to carried out by Pencourage, a new anonymous \\"diary-style\\" social media website. Researchers found that at least one in four women exaggerated or twisted what they are doing on social media once a month. The survey of 2000 women found they mostly pretended to be out on the town, when in fact they are home alone, and beautify about an exotic holiday or their job. The most common reasons for women to write _ included worrying their lives would seem \\" boring\\", jealousy at seeing other people's more exciting posts and wanting to impress their friends and acquaintances. Psychologists suggested that as people attempt to stay connected on social media, they can in fact be left more isolated. They also said that the more we try to make our lives seem perfect, the less perfect we feel. According to the OnePoll survey, one third of women surveyed admitted to dishonesty on social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter at some stage. Almost one in four admitted to lying or exaggerating about key aspects of their life online between one and three times a month while almost one in 10 said they lied more than once a week. Nearly 30 percent of women lied about \\"doing something when I am home alone\\", almost a quarter overstated their alcohol consumption while one in five were not truthful about their holiday activities or their jobs.

They also acknowledged Mrs Obama's work for the education of girls around the world and on behalf of refugees. Lord Mayor Cllr Brendan Carr confirmed the couple had indicated through contacts their happiness to accept. A meeting will be held with US Embassy officials within days and a visit could be organised by the end of the year, he added. He also said the couple saw it as an opportunity for another visit. President Obama and his wife visited the Republic of Ireland in 2011 as part of a tour of Europe. During their stay, the Obamas went to Moneygall, a small village in County Offaly which was home to one of President Obama's ancestors who emigrated to the US in 1850. The motion to grant the honour was carried by 30 votes in favour with 23 against. Cllr Carr, who proposed the motion, told councillors there was precedent for a couple receiving the honour as it was granted to the Crown Prince and Princess of Japan in 1985 for their diplomatic activities. He said Mr Obama had regretted some US actions in the Middle East and the honour was not a \\"canonisation\\" of the couple. Other international figures to receive the honour include former US President Bill Clinton, former South African President Nelson Mandela and Burmese pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi.

Exposing yourself to HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can be a long-term cost to what you consider a little bit of fun. You might put yourself in dangerous situations in the pursuit of sexual pleasure such as illegal prostitution. If you know the risks yet continue to put yourself in risky situations, this might be part of an addiction. You might feel stressed or overworked and use sex as a way to feel better. Just like drug addicts turn to drugs when life feel overwhelming, you might turn to sex. If you start to feel out of sorts or ‘off,’ you may use sex as a reset to return to normal. When you feel stressed, you might turn to sex as your first option to relieve stress over other options available to you. If you use sex as a stress reliever or if you have trouble stopping, then you may have a sex addiction. Some people with a sex addiction have trouble experiencing true intimacy. This can include being intimate with someone on an emotional level or sexual level. You may form little attachment to your sexual partners or fail to truly connect with any love interests beyond sex. You may want to have a relationship yet not know how to connect in an intimate way beyond sex. Sex may not feel fulfilling as a form of intimacy.

A:","completion":"Mary Thom was an editor of \\"Ms. Magazine\\" for 20 years, from 1972 until 1992. Ms. Magazine is an American feminist publication founded by Gloria Steinem and Dorothy Pitman Hughes, and is widely recognized for its influence on discussions regarding gender, politics, and social issues. As a political publication, it is essential to analyze the political agenda of Ms. Magazine, and by extension, Mary Thom's work within. The political agenda of Ms. Magazine during Mary Thom's tenure as an editor can be described as primarily focused on advocating for women's rights and advancing feminist agendas, with additional focus on broader sociopolitical issues and civil rights. Here are a few key aspects of the political goals and positions the magazine pursued: 1. Gender Equality: At its core, Ms. Magazine is a feminist publication striving for gender equality in all realms of life, including equal pay, access to education, and fair treatment in the workplace. Mary Thom and her fellow editors contributed significantly to raising awareness and support for the Equal Rights Amendment to the US Constitution and championing Title IX, which prohibits gender discrimination in federally funded education programs. 2. Reproductive Rights: A pivotal aspect of Ms. Magazine's political agenda has been advocating for women's reproductive rights, particularly access to safe and legal abortions, contraception, and comprehensive sex education. Throughout her tenure, Thom worked to inform readers about domestic and international policies that impacted reproductive rights and urged political activism in support of pro-choice legislation. 3. Violence Against Women: Ms. Magazine has been instrumental in bringing attention to the pervasive issue of violence against women, addressing topics such as domestic violence, sexual assault, and harassment. Under Thom's editorial oversight, the magazine played an essential role in shaping public discourse around violence against women and supporting the development and enactment of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). 4. LGBTQ+ Rights: Alongside its focus on women's rights, Ms. Magazine also took a strong stance in support of LGBTQ+ rights. During the tenure of Mary Thom, the magazine actively tackled various issues related to the LGBTQ+ community, such as same-sex marriage, anti-discrimination policies, and HIV/AIDS awareness. 5. Racial and Social Justice: Recognizing the intersectionality of gender with other forms of discrimination, Ms. Magazine has long been committed to advancing racial and social justice. Mary Thom and her colleagues addressed issues such as racial and economic inequality, immigrants' rights, and welfare reform, with a particular emphasis on the unique challenges faced by women of color. In summary, the 20-year tenure of Mary Thom as an editor at Ms. Magazine was marked by a political agenda centered on championing women's rights, gender equality, and broader social justice issues.

Article: The Protestant Reformation inspired a literal interpretation of the Bible, with concepts of creation that conflicted with the findings of an emerging science seeking explanations congruent with the mechanical philosophy of René Descartes and the empiricism of the Baconian method. After the turmoil of the English Civil War, the Royal Society wanted to show that science did not threaten religious and political stability. John Ray developed an influential natural theology of rational order; in his taxonomy, species were static and fixed, their adaptation and complexity designed by God, and varieties showed minor differences caused by local conditions. In God's benevolent design, carnivores caused mercifully swift death, but the suffering caused by parasitism was a puzzling problem. The biological classification introduced by Carl Linnaeus in 1735 also viewed species as fixed according to the divine plan. In 1766, Georges Buffon suggested that some similar species, such as horses and asses, or lions, tigers, and leopards, might be varieties descended from a common ancestor. The Ussher chronology of the 1650s had calculated creation at 4004 BC, but by the 1780s geologists assumed a much older world.

Build a movie plot around this: Who sneaked onto the plane? Eliot","completion":"Title: \\"The Infiltrator\\" Genre: Action-Adventure, Thriller Plot: Act 1: The Riddle in the Skies The story begins with a series of mysterious airplane hijackings occurring around the globe. The world's top intelligence agencies are baffled, unable to identify any pattern to the incidents. Air travel has become increasingly risky, as criminal organizations keep demanding ransoms for the safe release of the passengers on board. Eliot Kowalski, a former Air Force pilot turned cybersecurity expert, notices a crucial detail that has been overlooked - a strange symbol that appears in each hijacking ransom video. Curiosity piqued, he conducts a thorough analysis and discovers a secret underground organization is orchestrating these hijackings. Act 2: The Secret Agent Determined to take the organization down, Eliot secures an offer from the CIA, eager to use his unique skills. Disguised as a passenger, Eliot is tasked to sneak onto multiple airplanes on high-risk routes and locate any potential hijackers on board before they can make their move. During his mission, Eliot befriends a bright and resourceful flight attendant named Mia, who starts noticing the same symbol that first intrigued Eliot. Together, they manage to thwart several hijackings, and the duo begins to form a bond as they keep traveling together and risking their lives. Act 3: Ground War Word of their successes eventually reaches the mastermind behind the organization: Maxwell Benedict. Furious that his plans are being thwarted, Maxwell decides to take matters into his own hands and lays an elaborate trap to capture Eliot and Mia. In a thrilling blend of air-bound combat and digital warfare, Eliot and Mia must fight off Maxwell, his henchmen, and a network of ruthless hackers. They must race against time to outwit and outfight their enemies, all while discovering the true motives behind the hijackings. Act 4: Unmasking the Truth As the story reaches its crescendo, Eliot and Mia uncover the shocking revelation - Maxwell's motive was to acquire chaos and fear in the world of air travel, all to promote his own company that sells security systems for the aviation industry. Eliot and Mia must use their combined skills and wit to bring Maxwell and his organization to justice, saving air travel from the grips of their malicious intent. Act 5: Safe Landing The final act sees a daring last stand between Eliot, Mia, and Maxwell in the sky, culminating in a pulse-pounding mid-air showdown. Our heroes use their brains, brawn, and resourcefulness to overcome their enemies, ultimately saving thousands of lives and ensuring the safe return of hijacked planes to their destinations. The epilogue shows Eliot and Mia testifying in court against Maxwell, leading to his conviction and the disbanding of his organization. The two friends, now partners in more ways than they ever imagined, resolve to continue protecting the world from unknown threats, forming an unlikely duo of secret agents always ready to answer the call. \\"The Infiltrator\\" - where unmatched courage and uncompromising intellect stand against the sinister forces that threaten to turn the very skies into a battleground."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Statement 1: \\"A drummer in a blue shirt is looking to his left.\\" Here, we have three pieces of information: a. There is a drummer. b. The drummer is wearing a blue shirt. c. The drummer is looking to his left. Statement 2: \\"A drummer looks at his friend to the left.\\" In this statement, we have two pieces of information: a. There is a drummer. b. The drummer is looking at his friend, who is to the left. Now, let's compare the information provided in these two statements. In both cases, there is a drummer, and the drummer is looking to his left. Therefore, the premise \\"A drummer in a blue shirt is looking to his left\\" could be true for the situation if \\"a drummer looks at his friend to the left,\\" provided that additional details are consistent. However, there is one detail in Statement 1 that is not mentioned in Statement 2: the blue shirt. Since Statement 2 does not say whether or not the drummer is wearing a blue shirt, we cannot confirm with certainty that the premise is true. It is also important to note that these statements can refer to different drummers or different situations. Taking these factors into account, the correct answer is (II).

Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? Choose your answer from: (I) no; (II) yes;","completion":"(I) no; The two questions are asking about different concepts in the field of physics. Let's break down each question to clarify. 1. What is the difference between potential and kinetic energy? Potential and kinetic energy are two types of mechanical energy. Mechanical energy is the energy that an object possesses due to its motion or its position. Kinetic energy and potential energy are closely linked, and the key difference lies in the nature of their definition. Kinetic Energy: Kinetic energy is the energy that an object possesses due to its motion. It is defined by the work needed to accelerate an object from rest to its stated velocity. The faster an object moves, the more kinetic energy it has. The formula used to determine an object's kinetic energy is KE = 0.5 * m * v^2, where m is mass and v is velocity. Potential Energy: Potential energy is the stored energy in an object due to its position relative to other objects. It is associated with forces that act on a body in a way that the body's position changes. Gravitational potential energy, elastic potential energy, and chemical potential energy are all examples of potential energy. The formula used to determine an object's gravitational potential energy is PE = m * g * h, where m is mass, g is gravity, and h is height. In summary, kinetic energy is associated with an object's movement, while potential energy is associated with an object's position or state. 2. What is the difference between kinetic energy and momentum? Kinetic energy and momentum are interrelated, but they are not the same thing. Kinetic Energy: As stated above, kinetic energy is the energy that a body possesses due to its motion. It is a scalar quantity, meaning it does not have direction, only magnitude. It is related to the velocity of an object squared, therefore even a lighter, slower moving object can have a large kinetic energy. Momentum: Momentum, on the other hand, is a vector quantity, it has both magnitude and direction. It is defined as the mass of an object multiplied by its velocity. The formula used to determine an object's momentum is p = m * v, where p is momentum, m is mass, and v is velocity. Unlike kinetic energy, momentum only depends on the object's mass and velocity, not the square of its velocity. Thus, momentum of a system remains conserved unless an outside force acts on it - this property is at the core of Newton's laws of motion. In summary, kinetic energy relates to the work an object can do due to its motion, relies on velocity squared and it is a scalar quantity. Momentum on the other hand, is a product of mass and velocity, it is a vector quantity and its conservation principle is fundamental to dynamics. Therefore, these are two distinct concepts within physics, each with their own definitions, formulas, and characteristics. So the two questions are not inquiring about the same information, hence, the answer is (I) no."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

In 1864 , the Taiping rebellion ended with the defeat of America , and Yang fled by ship from Nanjing to Shanghai .","completion":"These two sentences may seem similar at first glance, but they actually convey different meanings. Let's break down each sentence to understand their distinct implications. Sentence 1: In 1864, the Taiping Rebellion ended with defeat to the Nanjing, and Yang fled to America from Shanghai by ship. This sentence tells us that: 1. The Taiping Rebellion ended in 1864. 2. The defeat took place in Nanjing, suggesting that Nanjing was the losing side. 3. After the rebellion, a person named Yang fled from Shanghai (presumably in China) to America by ship. Sentence 2: In 1864, the Taiping rebellion ended with the defeat of America, and Yang fled by ship from Nanjing to Shanghai. This sentence conveys that: 1. The Taiping Rebellion ended in 1864, just like in the first sentence. 2. However, in this case, it states that America was defeated, which means America was somehow involved in the rebellion and was on the losing side. This would be historically incorrect, as the Taiping Rebellion took place in China and did not involve America. 3. The person named Yang fled from Nanjing to Shanghai by ship. It doesn't mention him fleeing to America. Instead, his journey is within China. In summary, the first sentence tells us about the end of the Taiping Rebellion resulting in a defeat in Nanjing and Yang's escape from Shanghai to America. The second sentence incorrectly implicates America as being defeated in the Taiping Rebellion and states that Yang fled from Nanjing to Shanghai within China."},{"prompt":"Given a sentence in German, generate a new German sentence by performing small changes on the sentence.

The journal was edited for several years by Stewart Duke-Elder. Currently, Harminder Dua and Arun Singh act as editors-in-chief. - The genocide in Bangladesh began on 26 March 1971 with the launch of Operation Searchlight, as West Pakistan began a military crackdown on the Eastern wing of the nation to suppress Bengali calls for self-determination rights. During the nine-month-long Bangladesh war for independence, members of the Pakistani military and supporting Islamist militias from Jamaat-e-Islami killed up to 3,000,000 people and raped between 200,000 and 400,000 Bangladeshi women in a systematic campaign of genocidal rape.

It also is derived from principles espoused by United States President Woodrow Wilson following World War I, after which some new nation states were formed, or previous states were revived after the dissolution of empires. The principle does not state how the decision is to be made, nor what the outcome should be, whether it be independence, federation, protection, some form of autonomy or full assimilation.

In 1939, a western branch of this Society changed its name to the Society of Western Artists. - The Logan Medal of the Arts was an arts prize initiated in 1907 and associated with the Art Institute of Chicago, the Frank G Logan family and the Society for Sanity in Art. From 1917 through 1940, 270 awards were given for contributions to American art. - James Brooks ( October 18 , 1906 -- March 9 , 1992 ) was an American muralist , abstract painter , and winner of the Logan Medal of the Arts . 'james brooks ' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'movement'? Choices: - abstract expressionism - cubism - modern art - surrealism The answer is:","completion":"abstract expressionism. James Brooks, an American muralist and abstract painter, is related to the movement of abstract expressionism. Born on October 18, 1906, and passing away on March 9, 1992, Brooks was well-known for his contributions to the American art scene. As a winner of the prestigious Logan Medal of the Arts, which was awarded between 1917 and 1940 for significant contributions to American art, Brooks was highly recognized and celebrated in the art community. As an artist, Brooks played an important role in the development and progression of abstract expressionism. This movement, which began in the 1940s, is characterized by its focus on the process of creating art and the emotional expression that the artist aims to represent. Abstract expressionism challenged the more traditional and formal art movements such as cubism, surrealism, and the modern art movement that had dominated European and American art scenes before. While Brooks was affiliated with numerous art organizations, his relation to the Society for Sanity in Art is of particular interest. This society, which included members staunchly opposing modern art forms such as cubism, surrealism, and abstract expressionism, witnessed a branch in its organization change its name to the Society of Western Artists in 1939. Despite this internal conflict, Brooks went on to become a prominent figure in the abstract expressionist movement. In this movement, artists like Brooks were unafraid to experiment with bold colors, gestural brushstrokes, and other techniques that sought to evoke emotion and meaning into their artwork. His works, like those of other abstract expressionist artists, are not meant to depict a specific object or scene but, instead, showcase the emotions and experiences of the artist during the creation process. In conclusion, James Brooks is connected to the object entity of abstract expressionism through the relation of 'movement.' As a celebrated painter and muralist, Brooks was a vital component in the development and progression of this groundbreaking art movement, which shook the foundations of traditional art forms and introduced a new way of perceiving and creating art in America and around the world."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Premise: \\"yeah yeah first economic battle we've ever been involved in\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"We've been in many economic fights before.\\"?","completion":"If we accept the premise \\"yeah yeah first economic battle we've ever been involved in\\" as true, then it provides us with an understanding that there has not been any prior involvement in economic battles. This would mean that it is a new experience or struggle in the realm of economics for the group or individual. To analyze whether this premise entails the hypothesis \\"We've been in many economic fights before,\\" we need to examine the logical connection between these two statements. Entailment is a logical relation where one statement necessarily follows from another. In other words, if a statement A entails statement B, then whenever A is true, B must also be true. The hypothesis is clearly stating that the subject has been in multiple economic fights before. This implies a previous engagement in economic struggles or competitions. Now, let's compare it with the given premise. The premise illustrates that this is the first economic battle, which refutes the claim that there is any past experience in this field. This indicates that there is a contradiction in the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. Thus, if we take the premise to be true, it does not entail the hypothesis \\"We've been in many economic fights before.\\" In fact, the truth of the premise suggests that the hypothesis cannot be true, as it directly contradicts the notion that it's the first instance of involvement in an economic battle."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. To begin, stand up straight with your arms extended by your ears. Then, sit back, like you're going to lean back in a chair. As you do this, swing your arms down and back behind you. Your knees should be directly over your feet, not positioned in front of your feet, or you won't generate enough momentum to land on your hands. Swing your arms forward until they reach over your head. Follow your hands with your eyes. At the same time, push through your toes to gain momentum and launch your body backward. Keep your legs together and your core muscles tight. Arching your back too much is called undercutting and will not only make your back handspring look less pretty, but it could also injure your back. As you fall, let your legs continue to drive you upward and backward. Point your toes and extend through your ankles. Make sure you keep your head back between your arms as they approach the floor. Reach for the floor as you fall backwards and make sure to keep your body arched. Keep your arms straight so you don't hit your head on the floor. Your fingers should be pointing up and away from your face with your palms flat on the ground. Let the momentum of your legs, with your lower body still following, carry you over. When your hands are planted on the floor, use the pads of your hands and fingers, your arms, and your shoulders for support. Don't put all of your weight and pressure on your hands. Snap your legs over your head and around to the floor, with your feet together and your toes pointed. Don't lock your knees, but keep your legs almost straight. Keep your shoulders in line with your hands. Continue by swinging your legs and feet over and snapping them down firmly toward the floor. Keep your upper body straight as your toes approach the floor. To finish the back handspring, land with your legs slightly bent and pop up to release your momentum. Bring your arms straight in front of you and then raise them up over your head. Don't be discouraged if you don't get it right immediately. Work with a spotter until you feel comfortable enough to do it on your own. With enough hard work, you'll have a neat and smoothly-executed back handspring in no time. Summary:","completion":"The user has provided detailed instructions on how to execute a back handspring in gymnastics. 1. Stand straight with arms extended by ears. 2.

Options: - toxic - light - isolated from sulphide pbs - very heavy - very dense The answer is \\"very heavy\\" because Answer:","completion":"The answer is \\"very heavy\\" because the difficulty the child faces in lifting the box of lead is directly related to its weight. Let us analyze each of the given options to understand why \\"very heavy\\" is the appropriate answer in this situation. 1. Toxic: While lead is known to be toxic, especially to children, this option does not explain why the child could not lift the box. Toxicity is related to the harmful effects the substance may have on individuals, but in this scenario, we are considering the physical properties that hinder the child's ability to lift the box. Therefore, toxicity is not the appropriate answer here. 2. Light: This option contradicts the situation presented. The child is unable to lift the box, which implies that the box is not light but heavy. A light box would not pose any difficulty for the child to lift, so this option is incorrect. 3. Isolated from sulphide pbs: This option refers to the chemical composition or source of the lead, specifically that it is not in the form of lead sulphide (PbS). While this may be an interesting fact about the material, it does not explain the child's difficulty in lifting the box. The weight of the box is the key issue in this scenario, not its chemical composition, so this option is not relevant to the answer. 4. Very heavy: The accurate answer is \\"very heavy\\" because it directly addresses the challenge the child faces in lifting the box. The heaviness of the box, which is due to the high density of lead, creates a significant obstacle for the child in this situation. The heavy weight prevents the child from lifting the box, and as a result, this answer best describes the reason why the child was unable to do so. 5. Very dense: While it is true that lead is a very dense material, this option does not fully explain the child's difficulty in lifting the box. Density refers to the mass of an object per unit volume, which is a related but distinct property from weight. A very dense material can be heavy, but the primary issue is the heaviness of the box, not its density. Therefore, this option does not capture the essence of the problem as well as \\"very heavy\\" does. In conclusion, out of the provided options, the answer \\"very heavy\\" most accurately and directly describes the reason why the child could not lift the box of lead. The box's weight, primarily attributed to the high density of lead, creates a considerable obstacle for the child, making it impossible for them to lift it."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Sabrina starts by mentioning some of the not-so-pleasant aspects of having children, such as diaper changing, dealing with throwing up and crying babies, and constantly attending to hyperactive small kids. She assumes that these challenges could be enough for someone to change their mind about wanting children quickly. Danie, however, responds saying that they love all those aspects of taking care of children and do not seem deterred by these challenges. Richard then brings up the fact that having children may mean giving up on certain activities such as dancing or traveling to places like New York, London, and Cambridge. Danie acknowledges that they are aware of these potential sacrifices and the benefits of being single and 'free'. They also indicate that they are currently filling their time with these activities until the right circumstances present themselves for having children. Richard jokes with Danie about exchanging babies for dancing, suggesting that Danie is really eager to become a parent. Danie confirms this by saying that having babies has always been their top priority, but they need the right circumstances for it to happen.

The premise and the hypothesis are not logically connected such that the truth of one necessarily implies the truth of the other. The premise states that several organizations were led by individuals who had spent years building personal relationships with members and working to champion the purpose and mission of their organizations. This statement highlights the commitment and dedication of these individuals to their organizations, as well as their focus on fostering strong connections with members and advancing the objectives of the group. On the other hand, the hypothesis claims that several organizations that were led by individuals did not care about themselves nor the people they swore to help. This statement portrays these individuals as indifferent and unconcerned about the well-being of the people they were supposed to assist and exhibits a lack of genuine interest in the goals of the organization. These two statements present contrasting scenarios involving the leaders of the organizations. While the premise emphasizes the positive and dedicated actions of the leaders, the hypothesis focuses on their perceived indifference and apathy towards the people they intended to help. To determine if the premise leads to the hypothesis, we have to consider the possibility of a causal relationship between the two. However, there does not appear to be a clear connection between the committed actions described in the premise and the indifferent attitude portrayed in the hypothesis. The premise does not offer any information or evidence that would suggest that such dedicated leaders would suddenly become uncaring or uninterested in their organization and its members. In conclusion, given the contrasting descriptions in the premise and hypothesis, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is true as well. The two statements do not have a logical connection establishing that the truth of one implies the truth of the other. It is essential to examine additional evidence or context that could explain the changed behavior of the leaders before drawing any definitive conclusions."},{"prompt":"Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What was the full name of the person who built a large wooden woolshed that still stands today?? The area now called Yarralumla is part of two original land grants, which were granted to free settlers for the establishment of farms. In 1828 Henry Donnison, a Sydney merchant who had arrived with his wife and family on the brig Ellen on 29–30 July 1828, was granted an allotment on the western side of Stirling Ridge. A second grant was made to William Klensendorlffe (a German who had served in the British Navy and arrived free in the Colony in 1818), who had bought the land from John Stephen, on 7 March 1839. Donnison's land was named Yarralumla in a survey of the area conducted in 1834. Yarralumla was a name for the area used by the local people, apparently meaning \\"echo\\". An area to the west of what is now the suburb was the Yarrolumla parish.The prominent New South Wales parliamentarian Sir Terence Aubrey Murray (1810–1873) purchased Yarralumla in 1837. He lived there with his wife Mary Murray (née Gibbes, 1817–1858), the second daughter of the Collector of Customs for NSW, Colonel John George Nathaniel Gibbes (1787–1873), MLC. In 1859, Murray sold Yarralumla to his brother-in-law, Augustus Onslow Manby Gibbes (1828–1897). Later that same year, Augustus' parents came to live with him at Yarralumla homestead. Augustus Gibbes improved the estate and acquired additional land by purchase and lease. However, In 1881, he sold Yarralumla for 40,000 pounds to Frederick Campbell, a descendant of Robert Campbell, in order to travel overseas. Frederick Campbell erected a new, three-storey, brick house on the site of the former Yarralumla homestead at the beginning of the 1890s. Campbell's house would later form the basis of what is now the Governor-General of Australia's official Canberra residence, known colloquially as \\"Yarralumla\\" or \\"Government House\\". Campbell also built a large wooden woolshed nearby in 1904. It remains standing to this day.In 1908, the Limestone Plains area, including Yarralumla, was selected as the site for the capital city of the newly established Commonwealth of Australia.

The Willamette's main stem is 187 miles (301 km) long, lying entirely in northwestern Oregon in the United States. Flowing northward between the Oregon Coast Range and the Cascade Range, the river and its tributaries form the Willamette Valley, a basin that contains two-thirds of Oregon's population, including the state capital, Salem, and the state's largest city, Portland, which surrounds the Willamette's mouth at the Columbia. Originally created by plate tectonics about 35 million years ago and subsequently altered by volcanism and erosion, the river's drainage basin was significantly modified by the Missoula Floods at the end of the most recent ice age. Humans began living in the watershed over 10,000 years ago. There were once many tribal villages along the lower river and in the area around its mouth on the Columbia. Indigenous peoples lived throughout the upper reaches of the basin as well. Rich with sediments deposited by flooding and fed by prolific rainfall on the western side of the Cascades, the Willamette Valley is one of the most fertile agricultural regions in North America, and was thus the destination of many 19th-century pioneers traveling west along the Oregon Trail. The river was an important transportation route in the 19th century, although Willamette Falls, just upstream from Portland, was a major barrier to boat traffic. In the 21st century, major highways follow the river, and roads cross it on more than 50 bridges. Since 1900, more than 15 large dams and many smaller ones have been built in the Willamette's drainage basin, 13 of which are operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE).

Sewards Answer:","completion":"Title: A Crimson Banquet Genre: Horror, Mystery, Comedy Plot: Act 1: Introductions and Suspicions The Sewards, a high society couple with a penchant for lavish parties, decide to host a dinner party in their noble mansion in Victorian England. Mr. William Seward is a successful businessman, while his wife, Lady Elizabeth Seward, is well-known for her social connections and impeccable taste. News spreads quickly, and the guest list expands with several distinguished figures from society. Rumor has it that Count Dracula, a mysterious and intriguing foreign aristocrat from Transylvania, will be in town. Upon hearing this, Lady Elizabeth, always looking to impress her peers, extends an invitation to him. To her delight, Count Dracula graciously accepts the invitation, leaving the Sewards thrilled yet slightly uneasy. At the night of the party, an air of excitement and intrigue fills their lavish home. Guests are intrigued to meet the elusive Count Dracula firsthand, while others are more apprehensive of the unknown Count's reputation. The atmosphere is a mix of anticipation, gossip, mingling, and secret suspicions. Act 2: The Crimson Banquet As the dinner commences, the guests cautiously observe Count Dracula, who appears to be the perfect gentleman with an entrancing charm. Despite everyone's initial fears, they find themselves drawn to him, listening closely as he regales them with tales of his castle and homeland. As the night proceeds, odd occurrences begin to unravel: mirrors seem to be missing or hidden, garlic dishes are absent from the menu, and some guests show signs of eventual weakness and uneasiness. Meanwhile, the Count remains as poised and enigmatic as ever, quietly observing everyone around him. Act 3: Unraveling the Mystery Lady Elizabeth, despite her initial fascination, begins to wonder if inviting Count Dracula was a wise move. Even Mr. Seward, who initially dismissed his concerns about the Count, starts to feel uneasy as more strange incidents transpire throughout the party. When a guest suddenly falls ill with an unknown ailment marked by two puncture wounds on her neck, panic erupts. The Sewards' physician, Dr. Van Helsing, joins the party and shares his knowledge of ancient vampire lore. He suspects Count Dracula may not be who he claims to be but rather a predator amongst the aristocracy. The Sewards and Dr. Van Helsing team up, utilizing the knowledge of vampires to identify and confront Count Dracula. As his true nature becomes apparent, a battle ensues between the remaining guests, the Sewards, and the Count, culminating in a thrilling chase that leads to the climax of the movie. Act 4: Confrontation and Resolution With Dr. Van Helsing's guidance, the Sewards lead the guests in a final confrontation against Count Dracula. Utilizing daylight and traditional weapons against the undead, they corner the vampire and force him to reveal his true identity. Realizing he is outnumbered and stands no chance, Count Dracula retreats, vowing to return. Though the night started with extravagance and splendor, it concludes with the relief of the guests who have bonded through shared adversity. The Sewards' party becomes infamous, going down in history as the most unsettling and exhilarating event that rekindles their love and determination to forego anything too mysterious.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Scalp eczema can cause problems for your scalp or any affected areas of your skin. Common symptoms include flaky skin (dandruff), itching, red skin, scaliness or crusting of the skin, greasy patches, and hair loss. Inflammation leads to red patches and high fatty acid content, which can make the skin greasy and yellow in some people. In infants, it is common in the scalp and can present as red, dry scaly plaques, or in more severe cases as thick white or greasy yellow scales. Other skin diseases such as fungal infection, psoriasis, dermatitis, and lupus may resemble scalp eczema. However, these differ based on the location and layers of the skin involved. If you aren’t sure whether your symptoms match those of scalp eczema, see your doctor. S/he can help you determine the cause of your symptoms and whether they are severe enough to require treatment. In addition to decreased oils and moisture present, doctors believe that a certain kind of yeast, Malassezia furfur, has a role in causing seborrheic eczema. Malassezia yeast is usually present on the outer surface of the skin. In those with scalp eczema, this yeast invades the superficial layers of skin and secretes substances that increase fatty acid production. This leads to inflammation and enhances production and dryness of skin, which causes the skin to flake. If your eczema is atopic, meaning that your family has a tendency to develop eczema, yeast may not be the culprit. Doctors believe that many people with atopic eczema have a faulty skin barrier due to a changed gene within the skin’s structural proteins. While doctors are not certain why some people develop seborrheic eczema, and others don’t, there do appear to be some factors that increase your risk, including: Being overweight or obese Fatigue Environmental factors (such as dry weather) Stress Other skin issues (such as acne) Certain medical conditions, including stroke, HIV, Parkinson’s disease, or head injury Alcohol removes protective oils from the skin surface, causing the scalp to dry out. This can make the flaking and itching worse and may be a contributing cause of seborrheic eczema. Be gentle with washing your skin and scalp. Do not scrub! Gently massage your skin with your fingers when washing your hair. The goal is to clean your hair without stripping the oils from your scalp. or surrounding skin. Though it can be difficult to avoid scratching when a part of your body feels dry and itchy, you should try not to scratch the affected areas of your scalp because the skin can become irritated and bleed. You could even cause a secondary infection if you scratch excessively. It is unlikely that you will be able to completely “cure” your disease with an effective treatment. Scalp eczema appears and then disappears when it is treated. However, it usually comes back and will require continuous treatment. Luckily, many of the treatments can be continued for long periods.","completion":"The article discusses scalp eczema, a skin condition causing symptoms such as flaky skin, itching, redness, and hair loss, and explores its potential causes, including the role of Malassezia yeast and genetic predispositions.

Philadelphia (CNN) -- A judge has ordered a singer known as \\"Black Madam\\" -- suspected of carrying out a fatal injection last year -- to stand trial on charges she performed illegal cosmetic procedures, including buttocks enhancements. Police arrested Padge Victoria Windslowe in March before she was about to host a \\"pumping party,\\" at which people pay for illegal silicone injections, police said. The 42-year-old remains in jail on 750,000 bail. She was charged with aggravated assault and deceptive business practices after an illegal injection of silicone was pumped into the buttocks of a 23-year-old woman in February, police said. Windslowe is scheduled for a formal arraignment on June 6. A trial date has not been set. The woman Windslowe is accused of injecting ended up in intensive care with possible silicone in her lung after paying 1,000 for the procedure, police said. She received the injection in the same house where Windslowe was arrested at another alleged \\"pumping party.\\" Police said Windslowe was sitting at the dining room table at the time of her arrest with unknown substances, syringes, cotton balls and instant glue. Windslowe first came to the attention of law enforcement last year after the death of Claudia Aderotimi, 20, a British woman who paid 1,800 for buttocks enhancements in a hotel room near Philadelphia International Airport, according to police. Police say they believe Windslowe was responsible for injecting Aderotimi with a substance that was supposed to be silicone. Windslowe has not been charged in connection with the death, which is still under investigation. The cause of death remains uncertain. A 23-year-old exotic dancer testified Wednesday that the February 2012 injections that landed her in the hospital were not the first she'd received from Windslowe, according to CNN affiliate Philly.com. \\"It was terrible ... her face was all over the news,\\" she said. \\"I thought, 'That was the same person who was touching me,'\\" reported Philly.com. Despite the controversy, she still went forward with the second procedure. \\"She still has silicone in her lungs,\\" Philadelphia district attorney Bridget Kirn told CNN affiliate KYW. \\"She'll continue to have silicone in her lungs, and the best hope that we have is that it stays there and she is able to have some quality of life. But as the doctor testified, it's precarious and we don't know.\\" A phone call to Windslowe's attorney Douglas Gould for comment was not immediately returned.

Tan has heard reports of caulk and other products being used in the injections, as well as injection substances being purchased outside of medical supply stores, she said.

While racing wildly with his friends in the snow, Richie's butler, Herbert Cadbury, controls the cars using a remote and guides the children back to Richie's house. He then reminds him about his responsibilities that are due to be executed on Christmas Eve, and instructs him to change his clothes and get ready for tea. Before going to do so, he visits his home scientist, Professor Keanbean, who shows him his recent invention, a wishing machine which works only on Christmas Eve. The day being that, Richie wishes for a \\"big pie\\" from it, and is given a \\"pig sty\\" instead. Cadbury is disgusted seeing this, and sends him off to change his clothes. He meets his parents, Richard and Regina Rich, to ask what they would like to have for Christmas. While with them, he also tries out his father's new fishing rod invented by Keanbean, which hooks on to a tuna sandwich in the vicinity. He then goes on to change his clothes. During tea, Richie meets his spoiled cousin, Reggie Van Dough, who wishes that he was as rich as Richie. Later, he dresses up like an elf with Cadbury as Santa Claus to distribute Christmas presents to the orphanage. While getting ready, Cadbury tells Richie about how he was a rock star in his youth days, in a band called Root Canal. When they take off in the sleigh with Richie driving it, Reggie takes control of it using the remote invented by Keanbean that Cadbury used earlier. He guides it through streets by shops, houses, and people, thus nearly destroying everything in the whole process. Richie and Cadbury end up in an accident in which the sleigh falls and literally explodes along with the presents, while Cadbury hurts his ankle badly. Richie runs off to fetch help, but once he enters the city, he sees that the situation has changed dramatically. Reggie is cooking up rumors about him, and all the people have turned against him.

Carbonation and caffeine can irritate the bladder, worsening urinary symptoms. Try to drink no more than 200 milligrams of caffeine daily—about the amount in 2 cups of coffee. That’s about half the maximum amount for a healthy adult. Drink no more than 4 alcoholic drinks in a given day or 14 drinks in a given week. It’s best to reduce your alcohol consumption as much as possible. Avoid drinking excess liquid in the evenings before you go to sleep. Going to bed with an empty bladder can help you avoid urinary discomfort and frequent urges overnight. Increase your fluid intake earlier in the day to make sure you are drinking enough overall. Men should aim to drink 15.5 cups (3.7 liters) of fluid a day. If you exercise strenuously or the weather is very hot, increase your fluid intake accordingly. Eat more fiber-rich foods, such as fruit with the skin on, vegetables, lentils, nuts, and beans, to ward off constipation. Constipation can worsen enlarged prostate symptoms and put additional pressure on your bladder. Fiber-rich fruits and vegetables include broccoli, apples, pears, carrots, Swiss chard, raspberries, and strawberries. Men should get 30–38 grams (1.1–1.3 oz) of fiber per day depending on their age. While fiber supplements are safe, they can cause constipation. Aim to get your fiber from your diet rather than supplements whenever possible. Wait about 30 seconds after you’ve finished urinating before trying to urinate again. Avoid straining or pushing. This can help you empty your bladder fully and reduce the frequency of UTIs. Talk to your doctor if you notice urinary troubles after starting another medication for an unrelated condition. Certain decongestants and antidepressants may aggravate urinary symptoms or cause prostate enlargement. Your doctor can advise if there is a different medication you should try that would manage your condition without causing prostate problems.

When single father Thurman Williams needed help filling out papers in a custody suit recently, he didn't look to his lawyer for help. He walked to a computerized kiosk at the Lamoreaux Justice Center in Orange and started tapping the keys. As part of a legal experiment, litigants without lawyers across California are using computerized video kiosks to prepare common court filings and seek basic legal advice. The kiosk used by Williams is part of a statewide effort to cope with a flood of litigants who cannot afford or refuse to hire lawyers. Court officials statewide fear the number of self-represented litigants has reached crisis levels and threatens to clog court calendars. Like Williams, more than 6,000 Orange County litigants have initiated court actions on I-CAN! kiosks or accessed the programs on the Internet, using home computers. Similar programs are operating in Sacramento, San Diego and Ventura. A recent study of the kiosks' first 18 months of operation concluded it is too soon to tell if the system will relieve pressure on court calendars. But the report, by UC Irvine's School of Social Ecology, said users were overwhelmingly positive about the free legal assistance. \\"It's made life a lot easier for me,\\" Williams said. \\"It's helped keep me from going to the poorhouse.\\" The 29-year-old Orange resident was directed to a kiosk in the Lamoreaux Justice Center by court staff. After putting on headphones and following the directions of a videotaped instructor, Williams filled out a quarter-inch stack of paternity and custody documents.

Julius Caesar is informed, and laughs. He makes a decision with his council and goes to Armorica, to speak with Vitalstatistix. He gives the Gauls a series of 12 tasks, inspired by Hercules (but new ones, since the 12 Labours are outdated). Vitalstatistix assembles their best warriors, Asterix and Obelix, to do the job. The Roman Caius Tiddlus is sent along with them to guide them and check they complete each task.The Twelve Tasks:1. Run faster than Asbestos, champion of the Olympic Games. Asterix, helped by the magic potion, follows Asbestos until he runs so fast he becomes a rocket and exceeds the speed of sound, before hitting an apple tree. His nose swells up like a balloon and Obelix comments on how Gaulish it looks.2. Throw a javelin farther than Verses, the Persian. Verses' javelin hits North America (still only inhabited by Indians, including another Goscinny-Uderzo character, Oumpah-pah), but Obelix's javelin somehow enters a stable orbit and ends up pursuing Verses into the distance. As far as anyone can tell, he's still running from it.3. Beat Cilindric, the German. Cilindric turns out to be an unexpectedly diminutive man wearing a Judo gi but he quickly beats Obelix with a \\"fighting technique he learnt in a distant land\\". Asterix defeats Cilindric by tricking him into giving a lesson and asking for demonstrations that eventually end up with Cilindric's own arms and legs tied in knots.4. Cross a lake. The problem being that in the middle of the lake is the \\"Isle of Pleasure\\", a paradise inhabited by beautiful Sirens. Both Asterix and Obelix are enchanted and drawn to the island, but Obelix comes to his senses quickly after discovering that there are no wild boars on the island, has an incandescent argument with the Sirens, and storms off declaring that they can't call it the Isle of Pleasure if they don't serve wild boars, calling Asterix to follow... Answer:","completion":"Caius Pupus, the hypnotist, hypnotizes himself. In Task 11 of \\"The Twelve Tasks of Asterix,\\" Asterix and Obelix are challenged to make the hypnotist laugh because no one has ever been able to make him laugh before.

The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil). - General Motors Holden, generally known as Holden, is an Australian automobile manufacturer that operates in Australia and is headquartered in Port Melbourne, Victoria. The company was founded in 1856 as a saddlery manufacturer in South Australia. In 1908 it moved into the automotive field, before becoming a subsidiary of the United States-based General Motors (GM) in 1931. After becoming a subsidiary of GM, the company was named General Motors-Holden's Ltd, becoming Holden Ltd in 1998the current name was adopted in 2005. - Hesse or Hessia (, Hessian dialect: \\"Hesse\\" ) is a federal state (\\"Land\\") of the Federal Republic of Germany, with just over six million inhabitants. The state capital is Wiesbaden; the largest city is Frankfurt am Main. Until the formation of the German Reich in 1871, Hesse was an independent country ruled by a Grand Duke (Grand Duchy of Hesse). Due to divisions after World War II, the modern federal state does not cover the entire cultural region of Hesse which includes both the State of Hesse and the area known as Rhenish Hesse (Rheinhessen) in the neighbouring state of Rhineland-Palatinate. - Engineers design materials, structures, and systems while considering the limitations imposed by practicality, regulation, safety, and cost. The word \\"engineer (\\"from the Latin \\"ingeniator\\"\\")\\" is derived from the Latin words \\"ingeniare\\" (\\"to contrive, devise\\") and \\"ingenium\\" (\\"cleverness\\"). The foundation education of an engineer is typically a 4-year bachelor's degree or in some countries, a master's degree in an engineering discipline plus 46 years peer-reviewed professional practice culminating in a project report or thesis. Engineers who seek a professional engineer license in N. America will be required to take further exams in ethics, law and professional practice. - Fritz Adam Hermann von Opel , before 1918 Opel ( 4 May 1899 , Rüsselsheim , Grand Duchy of Hesse - 8 April 1971 ) , was the only child of Wilhelm von Opel and a grandson of Adam Opel , founder of the Opel company . He is remembered mostly for his spectacular demonstrations of rocket propulsion that earned him the nickname \`\` Rocket Fritz '' . Opel was born in Rüsselsheim and educated at the technical university of Darmstadt . After graduation , he was made director of testing for the Opel company and also put in charge of publicity . In the 1920s , he became interested in using rockets in publicity stunts for the company and sought advice from Max Valier of the newly formed Verein für Raumschiffahrt ( VfR - \`\` Spaceflight Society '' ) and Friedrich Sander , a pyrotechnics manufacturer from Bremerhaven . On 15 March 1928 Opel tested his first rocket - powered car , the RAK.1 , and achieved a top speed of 75 km / h ( 47 mph ) in it , proving the feasibility of the concept of rocket propulsion . Less than two months later , he reached a speed of 230 km / h ( 143 mph ) in the RAK.2 , driven by 24 solid - fuel rockets . Later that same year , he purchased a sailplane named the \`\` Lippisch Ente '' ( Ente is \`\` duck '' in German ) from Alexander Lippisch and attached rocket motors to it , creating the world 's first rocket plane on 11 June . The aircraft exploded on its second test flight , before Opel had had a chance to pilot it himself , so he commissioned a new aircraft , also called the RAK.1 , from Julius Hatry , and flew it at Frankfurt - am - Main on 30 September 1929 . In the meantime , another mishap had claimed the RAK.3 , a rocket - powered railway car powered by 30 solid - fuel rockets which had reached a speed of 254 km / h ( 157 mph ) . Also in 1928 , Opel built and test ran a rocket - powered motorcycle called the Monster . Opel left the family firm and Germany after 1929 . On 25 April 1940 Fritz von Opel was taken off the Italian liner Conte di Savoia by the British authorities at Gibraltar .

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? surprised at the variety of tones in spielberg 's work","completion":"The sentiment of the following sentence \\"surprised at the variety of tones in Spielberg's work\\" can be considered as positively neutral. First, let's analyze the elements of the sentence. The sentence is focused on the reaction of a person to the variety of tones in the works of Steven Spielberg, a well-known film director, producer, and screenwriter. The emotion \\"surprised\\" can be both positive and negative depending on the context in which it appears. In this case, the surprise seems to be related to the realization that Spielberg's works offer a variety of tones, which is often considered to be a testament to a talented filmmaker's versatility and creativity. The admiration of the variety of tones in Spielberg's work can be considered a positive sentiment as it acknowledges the multifaceted and diverse nature of Spielberg's artistic endeavors. However, the sentence does not explicitly highlight whether the surprise is because of a positive or negative discovery, leaving room for potential neutrality. Thus, the sentiment can neither be concluded as overtly positive nor negative in nature. In conclusion, given the context and the presence of surprise without further specification, the sentiment of the sentence can be categorized as positively neutral. This means that while it may not be an overtly positive statement, it leans more toward the positive side of the spectrum by appreciating Spielberg's range as a filmmaker and the variety of tones he has masterfully applied in his work."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - Water evaporates from the ground up to the sky - Water droplets are in clouds - The air gets cold - Water droplets turn into ice crystals - Ice crystals in clouds stick together and become snowflakes. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more ice crystals become snowflakes happens, how will it affect LESS snow. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"To analyze the perturbation hypothesis, we will go through the process step by step: 1. Water evaporates from the ground up to the sky. - In this instance, the perturbation hypothesis does not directly affect the evaporation process. 2. Water droplets are in clouds. - The perturbation hypothesis does not directly impact water droplets' formation in clouds. 3. The air gets cold. - This step remains unaffected by the perturbation hypothesis as well. 4. Water droplets turn into ice crystals. - The perturbation hypothesis does not directly influence the formation of ice crystals from water droplets. 5. Ice crystals in clouds stick together and become snowflakes. - Here, the perturbation hypothesis suggests that more ice crystals become snowflakes. This implies that the rate at which ice crystals combine to form snowflakes increases. Now, let's consider how this increased rate of snowflake formation affects the possibility of LESS snow: - If more ice crystals become snowflakes in a shorter time, it might lead to a higher concentration of snowflakes in the clouds. This could, in turn, cause the clouds to be \\"overloaded\\" with snowflakes, leading to sooner and faster snowfall than under normal circumstances. - However, once these \\"overloaded\\" clouds have released their snow, it could result in a period of less snowfall or even no snowfall, as the process of evaporation, cloud formation, and ice crystal formation has to restart. The speed of this process would depend on various factors, such as temperature, humidity, and wind currents. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis might indirectly lead to LESS snow, although this reduction may only be temporary. The increased rate of snowflake formation could cause a faster snowfall earlier on, but this may be followed by a period of reduced snowfall as the atmosphere transitions back to the beginning of the process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He walked to a computerized kiosk at the Lamoreaux Justice Center in Orange and started tapping the keys. As part of a legal experiment, litigants without lawyers across California are using computerized video kiosks to prepare common court filings and seek basic legal advice. The kiosk used by Williams is part of a statewide effort to cope with a flood of litigants who cannot afford or refuse to hire lawyers. Court officials statewide fear the number of self-represented litigants has reached crisis levels and threatens to clog court calendars. Like Williams, more than 6,000 Orange County litigants have initiated court actions on I-CAN! kiosks or accessed the programs on the Internet, using home computers. Similar programs are operating in Sacramento, San Diego and Ventura. A recent study of the kiosks' first 18 months of operation concluded it is too soon to tell if the system will relieve pressure on court calendars. But the report, by UC Irvine's School of Social Ecology, said users were overwhelmingly positive about the free legal assistance. \\"It's made life a lot easier for me,\\" Williams said. \\"It's helped keep me from going to the poorhouse.\\" The 29-year-old Orange resident was directed to a kiosk in the Lamoreaux Justice Center by court staff.

Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","completion":"Yes, both questions are inquiring about the same information, i.e., the process of selecting keywords. To answer the question: \\"How to choose keywords?\\" Here's a step-by-step approach to choosing keywords: 1. Identify your topic: First, you need to know what your content, product, or service is about. This will allow you to brainstorm and think of relevant words and phrases that people might use to search for your content. 2. Brainstorm keyword ideas: Write down all the keywords you think are relevant to your topic. These keywords can be single words or phrases. You can include synonyms and various forms of the same word. 3. Use keyword research tools: There are a number of free and paid keyword research tools available online, such as Google Ads Keyword Planner, Moz's Keyword Explorer, and SEMrush. These tools can help you find more keyword ideas and provide information on search volume, competition, and other relevant data. 4. Analyze keyword metrics: Once you have a list of keywords, investigate the search volume, competition, and relevance of each keyword. Choose keywords with high search volume and low competition, as these keywords have the potential to drive more traffic to your content. 5. Check competitor keywords: If your competitors are ranking well for certain keywords, it might be worth targeting those keywords as well. Analyze what keywords your competitors are using and see if they can be incorporated into your strategy. 6. Group and prioritize keywords: Organize your keywords into groups based on their relevance to your content. Prioritize which keywords you want to target based on their potential to drive traffic, taking into consideration their search volume, competition, and relevance. 7. Refine and update your keyword list: Keyword research is an ongoing process. As your content evolves and your target audience changes, you may need to revisit your keywords and update them accordingly. Keep an eye on your analytics to determine the effectiveness of your targeted keywords and make adjustments as needed. In summary, choosing the right keywords involves brainstorming ideas, using keyword research tools, analyzing keyword metrics, evaluating competitors, and refining your keyword list over time."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

PCBs intended for extreme environments often have a conformal coating, which is applied by dipping or spraying after the components have been soldered. The coat prevents corrosion and leakage currents or shorting due to condensation. The earliest conformal coats were wax; modern conformal coats are usually dips of dilute solutions of silicone rubber, polyurethane, acrylic, or epoxy. Another technique for applying a conformal coating is for plastic to be sputtered onto the PCB in a vacuum chamber. The chief disadvantage of conformal coatings is that servicing of the board is rendered extremely difficult.

Kingdoms are divided into smaller groups called phyla. Traditionally, some textbooks from the United States used a system of six kingdoms (Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Protista, Archaea/Archaeabacteria, and Bacteria/Eubacteria) while textbooks in Great Britain, India, Australia, Latin America and other countries used five kingdoms (Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Protista and Monera). Some recent classifications based on modern cladistics have explicitly abandoned the term \\"kingdom\\", noting that the traditional kingdoms are not monophyletic, i.e., do not consist of all the descendants of a common ancestor. When Carolus Linnaeus introduced the rank-based system of nomenclature into biology in 1735, the highest rank was given the name \\"kingdom\\" and was followed by four other main or principal ranks: class, order, genus and species. Later two further main ranks were introduced, making the sequence kingdom, phylum or division, class, order, family, genus and species. In the 1960s a rank was introduced above kingdom, namely domain (or empire), so that kingdom is no longer the highest rank. Prefixes can be added so \\"subkingdom\\" (\\"subregnum\\") and \\"infrakingdom\\" (also known as \\"infraregnum\\") are the two ranks immediately below kingdom. Superkingdom may be considered as an equivalent of domain or empire or as an independent rank between kingdom and domain or subdomain. In some classification systems the additional rank \\"branch\\" (Latin: \\"ramus\\") can be inserted between subkingdom and infrakingdom (e.g. Protostomia and Deuterostomia in the classification of Cavalier-Smith).

The 10-part documentary tells the real-life story of Steven Avery. He was wrongfully imprisoned for 18 years for sexual assault. After his release he was then accused and found guilty of murdering a young woman, Teresa Halbach. Many think he was set up by law officials in Manitowoc County, Wisconsin, who feared they faced a huge financial penalty over the first case. Mr Strang said the series was a good exploration of larger issues in the American criminal justice system \\"through the prism of two small, compelling story lines\\". Steven Avery's nephew Brendan Dassey is 16 in the documentary and finds himself involved with murder allegations against his uncle. He is convicted of helping to kill Ms Halbach, and imprisoned. Mr Strang described a scene in which the teenager is being questioned as \\"really wrenching viewing\\". \\"That's unfortunately not an uncommon experience for children who are pulled into a police investigation or into the adult criminal justice system, and indeed for many people with learning disabilities or difficulties who are confronted with well-trained and aggressive police interviewers.\\" Mr Strang had a front row seat during the trial and defended claims from the prosecutor Ken Kratz that crucial facts had been left out. \\"The perspective on this is interesting, right? \\"This film manages to cram in all of the most significant evidence and arguments that the state made.

Si vous diminuez le pourcentage d'utilisation du bien meuble à des fins commerciales, vous pourriez devoir rembourser une partie du CTI déjà obtenu. Translate to English","completion":"If you percentage of usage of the movable property for commercial purposes decreases, you might be required to reimburse a portion of the Input Tax Credit (ITC) already obtained. In this context, the movable property refers to a certain type of asset that is utilized for commercial purposes, while the Input Tax Credit (ITC) is a tax mechanism that allows businesses to deduct the tax they have paid on inputs used in the production process or for providing services. Decreasing the percentage usage of a movable property could potentially impact the eligibility for ITC, which is why businesses might have to reimburse a portion of the ITC already obtained. This is because the tax credits are calculated based on the percentage of the movable property utilized for commercial purposes. Thus, reducing the usage means the business should have claimed a lesser amount of ITC initially. To ensure that the correct ITC amount is claimed and any necessary adjustments are made, businesses should monitor the usage of their movable property and update their records accordingly. Reimbursing the over-claimed portion of ITC can help maintain compliance with tax regulations and prevent any penalties or interest charges on the over-claimed amount. In addition, businesses may also need to adjust their future ITC claims to accurately reflect the updated usage of the movable property for commercial purposes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Question: \\"Who mentions a connection with the narrative mentiond?\\" Context: \\"Davies identifies Paine's The Age of Reason as \\"the link between the two major narratives of what Jean-François Lyotard calls the narrative of legitimation\\": the rationalism of the 18th-century Philosophes and the radical, historically based German 19th-century Biblical criticism of the Hegelians David Friedrich Strauss and Ludwig Feuerbach. \\"The first is political, largely French in inspiration, and projects 'humanity as the hero of liberty'. The second is philosophical, German, seeks the totality and autonomy of knowledge, and stresses understanding rather than freedom as the key to human fulfilment and emancipation. The two themes converged and competed in complex ways in the 19th century and beyond, and between them set the boundaries of its various humanisms. Homo homini deus est (\\"The human being is a god to humanity\\" or \\"god is nothing [other than] the human being to himself\\"), Feuerbach had written.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"In the given context, it is Davies who mentions a connection between the two major narratives of what Jean-François Lyotard calls the \\"narrative of legitimation.\\" Davies identifies Thomas Paine's work, The Age of Reason, as the link between these two narratives. The narratives discussed here are derived from various philosophical movements and intellectual traditions, which, according to Lyotard, often seek to provide legitimation for certain ideas or beliefs. The two particular narratives that Davies connects through Paine's The Age of Reason can be outlined as follows: 1. The first narrative is rooted in the political and philosophical ideas of the 18th-century French Enlightenment, also known as the philosophes. This narrative is heavily influenced by rationalism and the belief in the power of reason. It highlights themes of liberty and emancipation, promoting the idea of \\"humanity as the hero of liberty.\\" Thinkers such as Voltaire, Rousseau, and Montesquieu are associated with this narrative. 2. The second narrative is based on the philosophical, historical and theological ideas arising from German 19th-century Biblical criticism, specifically from Hegelians David Friedrich Strauss and Ludwig Feuerbach. This narrative focuses on the pursuit of a comprehensive and autonomous understanding of knowledge. Unlike the first narrative, this one emphasizes the importance of understanding as the key to human fulfillment and emancipation. Davies argues that Paine's The Age of Reason bridges the gap between these two narratives by combining political and philosophical elements from both the French Enlightenment and German 19th-century Biblical criticism. As a result, the book serves as a linking piece that helps to create a dialogue and illuminate the similarities and differences between the two ways of thinking. Furthermore, these two narratives converged and competed in various ways throughout the 19th century, setting the boundaries for different interpretations of humanism. Feuerbach's statement, \\"Homo homini deus est\\" (\\"The human being is a god to humanity\\" or \\"god is nothing [other than] the human being to himself\\"), encapsulates the essence of this humanistic perspective and the connections between the two narratives. In summary, Davies identifies a connection between the two major narratives of legitimation discussed by Jean-François Lyotard. Through Thomas Paine's The Age of Reason, elements of French rationalism and German philosophical criticism come together, contributing to the development and understanding of humanism in the 19th century and beyond."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: U.S. President Henry Ashton (Hurt) attends a political summit in Salamanca, Spain, to promote an international treaty. Displayed with eight differing viewpoints, an assassination attempt on the president occurs, relayed in a time span of 23 minutes. Each time the events unfold from the beginning, a new vantage point is shown revealing additional details, which ultimately completes the story of what actually took place during the incident.[2] From the first vantage point, GNN producer Rex Brooks (Weaver), directs various media personnel from a mobile television studio as the president arrives at the gathering. Mayor De Soto (Rodriguez) delivers a short speech and then introduces the president, who is shot twice as he greets the crowd from the podium. An explosion outside the plaza soon follows. Moments later, the podium itself is destroyed by a secondary explosion, killing and injuring numerous people. As the smoke clears, GNN reporter Angie Jones (Saldana) is seen lying dead in the rubble.[2] The second vantage point follows Secret Service agents Thomas Barnes (Quaid) and Kent Taylor (Fox). Barnes notices a curtain fluttering in the window of a nearby building that was allegedly vacated. He also observes American tourist Howard Lewis (Whitaker) filming the audience. After the president is shot, Barnes tackles a man rushing to the podium named Enrique (Noriega). Taylor pursues a lead to a potential assassin. Following the second explosion, Barnes barges into the GNN production studio and asks to view their footage. He calls Taylor, who reports the direction of the suspected assassin's escape route. Barnes then views an image on one of the camera's live feeds that startles him and prompts him to run out.[2] In the third vantage point, Enrique, a Spanish police officer assigned to protecting the mayor of Salamanca, sees his girlfriend Veronica (Zurer), being embraced by a stranger and overhears them speaking about meeting under an overpass.

Answer:","completion":"Given the layered intricacies of the movie plot involving the assassination attempt on U.S. President Henry Ashton at a political summit in Salamanca, Spain, there are many aspects that can give rise to inquiries. You may ask about character motivations, the narrative structure, or the implications of the differing viewpoints. One of the possible questions about this movie plot could be: \\"How do the eight differing viewpoints contribute to the overall narrative structure and suspense in the movie plot, particularly in unraveling the intricacies behind the assassination attempt on U.S. President Henry Ashton during the political summit in Salamanca, Spain?\\" This question probes into the core narrative technique used in the storyline - the aspect of reframing the same time span of 23 minutes from eight different perspectives. The key factor addressed in this question revolves around the suspense and the uncovering of the event's dynamic, including the attempted assassination of the President and the two subsequent explosions. Moreover, this question delves into how these differing viewpoints — right from GNN producer Rex Brooks, Mayor De Soto, Angie Jones, Secret Service agents Thomas Barnes and Kent Taylor, to the Spanish police officer Enrique — influence the viewer's perception and understanding of the event. It also opens up a discussion on whether these multiple angles lead the narrative towards a more comprehensive understanding or if they create further confusion and misdirection. Additionally, this question places importance on various subtle cues noticed by different characters, such as the curtain fluttering in the window of a supposedly vacant building observed by Secret Service agent Barnes, and the seemingly innocent conversation about meeting under an overpass overheard by the Spanish police officer Enrique. Each small detail contributes immensely to the plot development, and analyzing the effect of these vantage points would delve into the ingenious intertwining of characters' perspectives in the movie plot."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

On 4 August 1950, with the PRC invasion of Taiwan aborted, Mao Zedong reported to the Politburo that he would intervene in Korea when the People's Liberation Army's (PLA) Taiwan invasion force was reorganized into the PLA North East Frontier Force. China justified its entry into the war as a response to \\"American aggression in the guise of the UN\\".\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"Based on the context provided, President Truman dispatched the United States Seventh Fleet to the Taiwan Strait on June 27, 1950, while Mao Zedong reported to the Politburo about his plans to intervene in Korea on August 4, 1950.

The events took place during a tense period in the Cold War, following the end of World War II and the establishment of the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1949.

The United States, under the umbrella of the United Nations, intervened on behalf of South Korea to repel the invasion and prevent the spread of communism in Asia. Fearing a possible invasion of Taiwan by the PRC, President Truman dispatched the United States Seventh Fleet to patrol the Taiwan Strait. This action aimed to prevent military hostilities between the Nationalist Republic of China (Taiwan) and the communist-led People's Republic of China. The presence of the Seventh Fleet effectively prevented the PRC from launching an invasion of Taiwan, prompting Mao Zedong to reevaluate his strategy. On August 4, 1950, Mao Zedong reported to the Politburo about his decision to commit Chinese forces to the Korean conflict. This commitment was contingent on the reorganization of the People's Liberation Army's (PLA) Taiwan invasion force into the PLA North East Frontier Force. Mao justified China's entry into the Korean War as a response to what he considered \\"American aggression in the guise of the UN.\\" In conclusion, President Truman's dispatching of the United States Seventh Fleet to the Taiwan Strait on June 27, 1950, happened earlier than Mao Zedong's report to the Politburo on August 4, 1950. This sequence of events unfolded amidst the backdrop of the Korean War and the ongoing tensions between the United States, China, and the Soviet Union during the Cold War era."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

News article: Victims blamed in India's rape culture Indians in Siliguri protest violence against women on July 26, calling for stricter punishments for rapists. Editor's note: Ruchira Gupta is the president of Apne Aap Women Worldwide, an Indian organization dedicated to ending sex trafficking. She is the 2009 recipient of the Clinton Global Citizen Award for her work with victims and survivors of sexual violence. (CNN) -- When I read about the rape of a 23-year-old photojournalist in Mumbai, I thought, here we go again. On December 6, 1992, when I was a 29-year-old reporter covering the demolition of a mosque in northern India, I was attacked. I wasn't raped, but my attackers sexually assaulted and then tried to kill me. Someone dragged me to a trench outside the mosque and pulled my shirt off. But a passerby jumped in, fought off my attackers and saved me. When I appeared in court to testify against the attackers, their lawyers asked me questions that implied I was responsible. How could the daughter of a good family have gone to cover the demolition? Did I smoke? What kind of clothes was I wearing? Did I believe in God? The judge did not stop them. It was a demoralizing and toxic experience, but one that is not unknown to women in India who choose to speak out against sexual attacks. They are silenced by a process that heaps shame, fear and guilt on them. Indian women feel sorrow, anger at U.S. student's harassment In rural Rajasthan in 1992, a judge dismissed charges filed by a low-caste, or Dalit, grassroots social worker, Bhanwari Devi, who said she was gang raped. She had been campaigning against child marriage. A judge said, \\"a middle-aged man from an Indian village could not possibly have participated in a gang rape in the presence of his own nephew.\\" A judgment like this not only deters other women from testifying against their rapists, it also emboldens the attackers, who know that they will get away with it. Most women say they would never tell the police about an attack, afraid that they would be ignored or even abused by the cops themselves. In June, 13 anti-rape protesters were arrested outside the home of the West Bengal chief minister and detained for more than eight hours. Ironically, they were protesting the lack of police protection for women in the state following the rape and murder of a 20-year-old college student whose body was found lying near a river near the outskirts of Kolkata, and that of a 14-year-old girl who was raped and killed in the town of Gede, 90 miles away, only three days later. Few women want to appear in court only to be stigmatized and traumatized -- unlike treatment of the suspects. While India's legal framework has improved for women over the past 20 years, the people implementing it are mostly male cops and lawyers who live in a deeply patriarchal society. Incidents of rape have gone up by 873% in India in the past 60 years. On average, each day, three Dalit women are raped in some part of our country. The conviction rate for rape cases in 2011 was 25% -- although some estimate only one in 10 rapes is reported. The conviction rate for men accused of raping Dalit women is almost nil. The National Crime Records Bureau's annual report of crime statistics also reports disturbing findings: A woman is raped somewhere in India every 20 minutes, and the number of children raped has increased by 336% in the past 10 years. This culture of impunity is certainly one of the reasons rape has too often become the weapon of choice for frustrated young men who blame women, increasingly visible in the workplace, for their unemployment, and who hope to regain jobs by frightening women back home through sexual violence. The desire to blame women is fed by a cult of masculinity promoted by corporate and political leaders who serve as role models for the rest of society. Harassment in India: 'The story you never wanted to hear' In the course of my work with Apne Aap Women Worldwide, I have seen the steady creeping of a rape culture into the fabric of India. We work to organize women in prostitution to resist their own and their daughters' rape. The biggest challenge we face is the attitude of politicians, senior police officials, heads of foundations and even policy makers who view rape as a normal part of society. Many have told me: \\"Men will be men.\\" Recently, when National Crime Records Bureau pegged West Bengal as the state with the highest incidence of crimes against women, the chief minister contested the bureau's statistics rather than tackling the problem. Continually, budget allocations to the Ministry of Women and Child Development are reduced. Debates to ensure equal power sharing between the sexes through the Women's Reservation Bill have gone nowhere. But no amount of violence and intimidation is going to force women back into their homes. In fact, homes are often the places where females are in the most danger -- from the time they are conceived to old age. An average Indian female could likely be a victim of foeticide, infanticide, malnourishment, dowry, child marriage, maternal mortality, domestic servitude, prostitution, rape, honor killings and domestic violence -- simply because she is female. Equipped with better education, women are courageously taking their place in the public sphere as doctors, lawyers, journalists, bankers, politicians, farmers, teachers and more. They are signing up for social justice movements to end the growing inequality and unemployment in our country. As yet another gang-rape victim suffers in a Mumbai hospital in India, we have to recognize the need to overhaul the criminal justice system. In December 2012, India and the world were shocked by the brutal gang rape and beating aboard a moving bus of a 23-year-old physiotherapy intern, who later died of massive internal injuries. It prompted desperate calls for reform, protests and close examination of India's attitudes toward rape. But after the initial outrage, it seems that the law has only changed on paper. The rape in Mumbai might not have happened if the culture of rape was truly overcome and sexual assaults were taken seriously. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.

This House would penalise religious hate speech What argument could one make about this debate topic?","completion":"Introduction: In today's diverse and multicultural world, religious hate speech is a deeply concerning issue. The debate on whether to penalise religious hate speech seeks to address the conflict between upholding freedom of speech and maintaining social harmony and fostering a culture of tolerance and acceptance. This topic challenges us to evaluate the implications of suppressing hate speech against the rights of individuals to express their beliefs openly. To that end, this essay will present an argument in favor of penalising religious hate speech to safeguard the rights and dignity of different religious groups and ensure social cohesion. Argument 1: Religious hate speech can lead to violence and discrimination. Allowing religious hate speech without any repercussions increases the risk of violence and discrimination against the targeted groups. In many instances, hate speech has acted as a catalyst for social unrest and has ignited violence against specific religious communities. For example, during the Rwandan genocide, hate-speeches by radio stations led to further violence against the Tutsis. Punishing those who incite hatred and discrimination enables governments and legal bodies to act proactively in preventing physical violence and potential loss of innocent lives. Argument 2: Penalising religious hate speech promotes social cohesion. Religious hate speech disrupts the social fabric of societies by promoting negative stereotypes, fostering fear, and spreading false information about certain religious groups. By addressing and penalising such actions, society can work towards reducing divisions and misunderstandings amongst its inhabitants. A socially cohesive society would work harmoniously, respecting one another's religious beliefs instead of spreading hatred and intolerance. Thus, penalising religious hate speech is essential for ensuring a peaceful and tolerant society. Argument 3: Respecting human dignity and emotional well-being. The right to human dignity is a universally accepted value, and every individual, regardless of their religious affiliation, deserves to be treated with respect. Hate speech often targets the core beliefs and values of an individual, leading to emotional distress and a loss of dignity. By penalising religious hate speech, the rights and dignity of every individual can be protected, fostering a safer environment where people can practice their faith without fear of being attacked verbally or emotionally. Argument 4: Drawing a line between free speech and hate speech. While freedom of speech is a deeply cherished right in democratic societies, it is not absolute. There has to be a balance, and a line should be drawn to prevent individuals from misusing the right to freedom of speech to spread hatred and provoke unnecessary discord. To that end, penalising religious hate speech allows society to establish a clear boundary between what can and cannot be said regarding religious matters. Such restrictions demonstrate that freedom of speech comes with the responsibility to respect and be sensitive to others' beliefs and backgrounds. Argument 5: Demonstrating a commitment to combat extremism and radicalisation. By penalising religious hate speech, governments are sending a strong message against the spread of extremism and radicalisation. Hate speech, as seen in recent years, has led to religious radicalisation and increased instances of terrorism and hate crimes. In penalising religious hate speech, governments and legal institutions can send a clear signal to identify and isolate extremists before their ideologies escalate into more significant issues or violent incidents. Conclusion: In conclusion, penalising religious hate speech is a necessary measure to protect society from the damaging effects of such expressions. By promoting social cohesion, respecting human dignity, and drawing clear boundaries between free speech and hate speech, governments around the world can create a more tolerant, harmonious, and safe environment for all religious groups. The responsibility to maintain and uphold these values lies with each individual, society as a whole, and the government as the enforcer of the laws. Therefore, this debate topic ultimately seeks to find the balance and harmony necessary for a diverse and multicultural society to thrive."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Firstly, the description of the actors - Vardalos and Corbett - suggests that they have performed well in their roles. The use of the word \\"vibrant\\" implies that their performances are full of energy and life, in a way that is enjoyable for the audience to watch. Furthermore, the word \\"charm\\" adds to the positive tone of the phrase because it indicates that they have been successful in creating engaging and likable characters, a quality that is often associated with a positive viewing experience. They have been effective and captivating in their portrayal of the characters, winning over the audience with their charisma. Additionally, comparing the subject of the sentence to these two actors - who have evidently performed well - suggests that the subject is also deserving of praise.

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Declines in population size can result in a loss of genetic diversity, and owing to genetic variation's role in the evolutionary potential of a species, this could in turn result in an observable Allee effect. As a species' population becomes smaller, its gene pool will be reduced in size as well. One possible outcome from this genetic bottleneck is a reduction in fitness of the species through the process of genetic drift, as well as inbreeding depression. This overall fitness decrease of a species is caused by an accumulation of deleterious mutations throughout the population. Genetic variation within a species could range from beneficial to detrimental. Nevertheless, in a smaller sized gene pool, there is a higher chance of a stochastic event in which deleterious alleles become fixed (genetic drift). While evolutionary theory states that expressed deleterious alleles should be purged through natural selection, purging would be most efficient only at eliminating alleles that are highly detrimental or harmful. Mildly deleterious alleles such as those that act later in life would be less likely to be removed by natural selection, and conversely, newly acquired beneficial mutations are more likely to be lost by random chance in smaller genetic pools than larger ones.Although the long-term population persistence of several species with low genetic variation has recently prompted debate on the generality of inbreeding depression, there are various empirical evidences for genetic Allee effects. One such case was observed in the endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi). The Florida panther experienced a genetic bottleneck in the early 1990s where the population was reduced to ≈25 adult individuals. This reduction in genetic diversity was correlated with defects that include lower sperm quality, abnormal testosterone levels, cowlicks, and kinked tails. In response, a genetic rescue plan was put in motion and several female pumas from Texas were introduced into the Florida population. This action quickly led... I am facing a new situation today: Molly and Brian are two friends who moved away from one another after becoming close in college. They still talk on the phone regularly and see each other a couple times a year. During a recent conversation, the subject of population comes up. Molly's town is currently increasing a steady decrease in population, and Brian's town has been seeing an increase in population. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: An Allee effect is not currently happening in which town? A:","completion":"Molly's town B: Brian's town Before answering the question, let's briefly analyze the Allee effect and its relation to population size and genetic diversity: - The Allee effect is an observable decrease in the overall fitness of a species. - It can occur when there is a decline in population size, leading to a loss of genetic diversity. - A smaller gene pool increases the chance of deleterious alleles becoming fixed through genetic drift. Now, let's analyze the new situation: - Molly's town is experiencing a steady decrease in population. - Brian's town is experiencing an increase in population. Based on the information provided, an Allee effect would likely not occur in Brian's town since the population is increasing, which would maintain or increase genetic diversity. Therefore, the correct answer is: B: Brian's town"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

He clashes with his liaison officer, Lieutenant Commander Robert Yarrow, over the fact that his men are not allowed to arm themselves against the Japanese. When the enemy lands in force on the island, he finally takes matters into his own hands, leading his men into the fray. This prevents Yarrow from springing a carefully devised trap that would have wiped out the invaders in a murderous machinegun crossfire, with minimal American losses. Instead, many of Donovan's men are killed unnecessarily. As a result of this tragedy, Yarrow finally convinces the US Navy to form Construction Battalions (CBs, or the more familiar \\"Seabees\\") with Donovan's assistance, despite their mutual romantic interest in war correspondent Constance Chesley. Donovan and many of his men enlist and receive formal military training. The two men are teamed together on yet another island. The Japanese launch a major attack, which the Seabees barely manage to hold off, sometimes using heavy construction machinery such as bulldozers and a clamshell bucket.

The acting was poor, and the storyline was non-existent. It was a waste of our money and we should have left, but we stayed hoping it would get better. It never did. From the grocery store incident, to the frosty's on the roof this movie had it's many flaws. As a comedy the jokes fell flat, and as a Christmas Story there was no magic at all. Please take my word for it this is a movie that you want to avoid at all costs.Pros - NoneCons -Bad Acting, direction, and script caused this movie's numerous flaws.

Solve this instance: Article: One of the sailors who sailed with Christopher Columbus on his second voyage to the New World was a man named Juan Ponce de Leon. This voyage changed his life. He decided to stay when Columbus returned. Ponce was named governor of Puerto Rico (then called Boriquien) in 1508. While there, he heard many stories of a magical water source. People called it the Fountain of Youth and said that drinking its water kept you young. For the next few years, Ponce tried to find out where the Fountain of Youth was. He asked permission from Spain's King Charles V to go in search of it. The king _ , as long as Ponce paid for the ships and crew himself. The young explorer did so readily, and they set off. It was March 1513. They sailed for days but didn't see the fountain. On March 27, he came within sight of the Florida coast. On April 2, he landed at what he named St. Augustine. This was the first Spanish settlement on the mainland of North America. He had several adventures along the way. He did not, however, find the Fountain of Youth. He returned to Boriquien. He continued to govern tile island, and he continued to hear stories of the Fountain of Youth. Finally, in 1521, he set out again. This time, he landed on the Florida coast again. While he and his men were building houses for a new settlement, they were attacked by native tribesmen . Many of his men died, but Ponce escaped, although he was injured. He reached Cuba and entered a hospital, where he died of wounds from the attack in Florida. Juan Ponce de Leon never found the Fountain of Youth. Neither did anyone else, at least as far as we know.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write some highlights for the following article: The United Nations is trying to put sexual violence on the international policy map, telling political and military leaders that wartime mass rape \\"is no more inevitable than, or acceptable than, mass murder.\\" Rape is being used by armed groups to reignite flames of conflict and to terrorize and humiliate communities in Africa, according to Letitia Anderson, women's rights specialist with the U.N.'s Action Against Sexual Violence in Conflict initiative. The U.N. is monitoring five countries closely because of sexual violence in conflicts. The five are the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire), Liberia, the Darfur region in Sudan, Chad and Cote d'Ivoire (formerly Ivory Coast). But it's not just Africa at which the U.N. is looking; it's cross-regional, Anderson told CNN. She said armed groups are branding the bodies of women and children with signature patterns, as cattle are branded, in places such as Congo, leaving scars so that their families and community members know they are victims of aggravated sexual violence. U.N. officials cite not just the mass scale of such crimes, but the horrific nature of the crimes as well. \\"Many are child soldiers, and they maybe have to rape their mother or their siblings and then kill them afterwards,\\" said Margot Wallstrom, the U.N. secretary-general's special representative on sexual violence in conflict. There have been no reparations for survivors in Africa because of the complete collapse of the legal system during conflicts, Anderson said. Wartime rape \\"is one of the great peace and security challenges of our time,\\" she said, but added it \\"has been the least condemned and most silenced war crime.\\" Wallstrom told reporters recently that in modern war, \\"rape is not a side effect, but it is actually a new frontline.\\" U.N. action on that frontline has included a 2008 Security Council unanimous adoption of a resolution acknowledging rape as a tactic of war and an impediment to peace. With the U.N.'s Action Against Sexual Violence in Conflict initiative, U.N. representatives have tried to put sexual violence in the spotlight. In May, Wallstrom took the U.N.'s message to the Democratic Republic of Congo where, she said, more than 200,000 women have been raped in the past 12 years of conflict. She visited Liberia in June and learned rape is still the No. 1 reported crime. One government survey in a Liberian county in 2005-2006 found that 92 percent of 1,600 women interviewed reported that they had experienced some form of sexual violence, including rape. Tackling stereotypes about the crime of rape will help ease the shame many societies attach to rape, and initiating discourse is the first step \\"to break the silence,\\" she said, repeating a well-known phrase among anti-rape advocates worldwide. Her message is motivated by the women and children she's met, Wallstrom said, adding, \\"Survivors are their own best advocates.\\" \\"The word 'woman' is not synonymous with 'victim' or 'vulnerable,' \\" Wallstrom added. \\"The women that I've met in the DRC, in Liberia, are agents of recovery and change.\\" As the U.N. initiative works to fight against wartime rape and to protect victims of that crime, Wallstrom sees her own U.N. role in a highly personal perspective. \\"I'm responsible not only to the secretary-general and Security Council,\\" she said, \\"but above all, to the survivors of this soul-shattering crime.\\" Highlights:","completion":"1. The United Nations wants to stop sexual violence during wars, saying it is not okay just like mass murder isn't okay. 2. They are watching five countries closely because of sexual violence: Congo, Liberia, Darfur in Sudan, Chad, and Cote d'Ivoire. 3. Armed groups are hurting women and children to scare communities. 4.

Write some highlights for the following article: The second season of the Showtime hit \\"Homeland\\" ended with an explosive finale that left the CIA headquarters in shambles and a former war hero on the run, suspected of setting a bomb that killed 219 innocent people. The third season, which premieres Sunday, begins 58 days where season two left off. At the Washington premiere of the new season, the cast told CNN what to expect when \\"Homeland\\" returns. With that in mind, here are 10 things you need to know about what's coming up on the Emmy-winning drama:. 1. Brody is missing. In the two episodes provided to critics, former military hero Nicholas Brody (Damian Lewis) is nowhere to be found. Now that he's a wanted terrorist -- whose videotaped confession from season one is public -- nobody knows where he is. The show's trailers reveal he's in hiding overseas, but how soon he shows up is anyone's guess. 2. The bomber of the CIA is revealed. The last season left viewers wondering if Brody was responsible for the bombing, but the true culprit (or culprits) will be revealed sooner rather than later. Jackson Pace, who portrays Brody's son, Chris, said we find out who set up the bombing and if Brody is culpable \\"relatively early in the season.\\" 3. The CIA is in a mess of trouble. After missing all the signs of Brody's continued ties to terrorism and the plot to bomb the memorial service of the vice president, the CIA faces the consequences of another massive intelligence failure. Claire Danes, who plays intelligence expert Carrie Mathison, put it this way: \\"The CIA is in a very precarious position, is being held on trial and may not survive.\\" 4. Brody's family is left to deal with the consequences. With her husband a wanted terrorist, Jessica (Morena Baccarin) is struggling to raise her two children under intense media scrutiny with the assistance of her mother after the military has turned its back on the family. 5. Dana is in a very dark place. Brody's daughter, Dana (Morgan Saylor), starts out the season in a really bad psychological place. \\"Her father was one of her closest allies and his bombing, as it's known ... has really put her in a bad place,\\" Saylor said. In fact, we learn early on that Dana recently attempted to kill herself. 6. Saul's loyalties are put to the test. In the aftermath of the bombing, Saul Berenson (Mandy Patinkin) is in charge of the CIA. His loyalty to long-term protÃ©gÃ© Carrie will again be put to the test as he tries to clean up the department's mistakes while seeking to protect the woman he's often clashed with in the past. 7. Carrie and Mrs. Brody will interact more. \\"We have a lot of really great scenes together this season,\\" Baccarin said about her work with Danes. In the earlier seasons, the two -- who have fought over the heart and loyalty of Nicholas Brody -- have only appeared together onscreen a few times, but expect more fireworks when they reunite. 8. The investigation into the bombing will play a major role. A Senate investigation is under way into the terrorist bombing. Both Saul and Carrie are asked to testify at heated hearings, where questions about Brody and his alliances with the CIA take center stage. 9. Everyone is at risk. In the season two finale, several main characters were killed off, showing that anyone could die at any moment. In fact, there were plans to kill off Brody, both in the first and second seasons. When asked how he makes the writers keep him alive, Lewis laughingly responded, \\"I have something on each of them.\\" But no one knows how long those secrets can keep him -- or any of the other characters on the show -- alive. 10. Despite it all, the cast is hopeful about the future. Members of the cast sounded optimistic when asked what they would like to see happen to their characters. \\"It would be amazing if the Brody family found a way to reconcile,\\" Baccarin said. Danes said that if she could decide, her character \\"would live happily ever after.\\" But as the show's fans know, that seldom happens on \\"Homeland.\\"","completion":"The third season of the Emmy-winning drama series \\"Homeland\\" premieres 58 days after the explosive finale of the second season, which left many questions unanswered. Here are 10 things you need to know about the upcoming season: 1. Brody (Damian Lewis) is missing in the first two episodes, with his whereabouts unknown after being accused of setting a bomb that killed 219 people. He may be hiding overseas, but when he will return is uncertain. 2. The identity of the CIA bomber is revealed early in the season, clarifying whether Brody is responsible. 3. The CIA faces the consequences of missing signs of Brody's connection to terrorism and the bombing plot, putting its future survival at risk. 4. Brody's family, including his wife Jessica (Morena Baccarin), struggles to cope with the aftermath of Brody being a wanted terrorist, facing intense media scrutiny and being abandoned by the military. 5. With her father a suspected terrorist, Dana (Morgan Saylor), Brody's daughter, is on a dark psychological path, having even attempted to kill herself. 6. Saul Berenson (Mandy Patinkin), now in charge of the CIA, must balance loyalty to long-term protégé Carrie and fixing the department's mistakes. 7. Carrie (Claire Danes) and Jessica Brody have more powerful interactions in this season. 8. A Senate investigation into the terrorist bombing plays a significant role, with Saul and Carrie testifying in heated hearings. 9. Anyone's fate is uncertain, as demonstrated by the deaths of several main characters in the previous season. 10. The cast is hopeful about their characters' futures, but as the show's fans know, happy endings are rare on \\"Homeland.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Organizers of the grand slam event said Thursday that they had introduced an \\"extreme heat policy\\" after temperatures rose above 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit). That means that matches already under way on court will be suspended at the end of the set being played. The organizers said the roofs would be closed at the Rod Laver Arena and the Hisense Arena so that players could continue their matches on those courts. But new matches won't start on outdoor courts \\"until the temperature falls back down to a temperature deemed fit for play by the tournament director,\\" the statement on the website said. The severe heat at Melbourne Park this week has already caused problems for players. Canadian Frank Dancevic fainted during his defeat in the first round on Tuesday. He said he thought the conditions were \\"inhumane.\\" On the same day, China's Peng Shuai blamed the heat after she cramped up and vomited during her defeat to Kurumi Nara of Japan. And it's not just players who have succumbed to the elements. One of the ball boys fainted during 11th-seed Milos Raonic's four-set victory over Spain's Daniel Gimeno-Traver on Tuesday. Some players worried. Several players have voiced concerns about the conditions. \\"Whether it's safe or not, I don't know. You've just got to be very careful these days,\\" Britain's Andy Murray, who has been a finalist in Melbourne in three of the last four years, said Tuesday. \\"There's been some issues in other sports with, you know, players having heart attacks.\\" Women's world No. 1 Serena Williams said Wednesday the fear of dehydration was giving her sleepless nights. But 17-time Grand Slam winner Roger Federer appeared unfazed. \\"Just deal with it, because it's the same for both (players),\\" he said Tuesday after defeating spirited Australian James Duckworth in the first round. Before Thursday, tournament officials had already introduced heat-related measures for matches in the women's draw, allowing for an extended break between the second and third sets. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology forecasts maximum temperatures in Melbourne of 44 degrees Celsius (111 degrees Fahrenheit) for Thursday and Friday. Temperatures are then expected to drop into the low 20s (high 60s and low 70s in degrees Fahrenheit) starting Saturday. The heat wave currently blasting southern Australia comes after the country experienced its hottest year on record in 2013, according to the Bureau of Meteorology.

Trivia question: \\"What does the Latin phrase \\"\\"ad infinitum\\"\\" mean?\\" And the answer is?","completion":"The Latin phrase \\"ad infinitum\\" translates to \\"to infinity\\" or \\"endlessly\\" in English. This phrase is derived from the Latin word \\"ad,\\" meaning \\"to\\" or \\"towards,\\" and \\"infinitum,\\" which is the accusative form of \\"infinitus,\\" translating to \\"infinite\\" or \\"boundless.\\" In various contexts, the use of \\"ad infinitum\\" holds different implications: 1. Mathematics: In mathematical contexts, \\"ad infinitum\\" is used to describe a process or sequence that continues indefinitely or infinitely. For instance, in the concept of limits or series, we often encounter an infinite number of terms in a sequence, requiring calculations or summations to be carried out \\"ad infinitum.\\" 2. Philosophy: Within the realm of philosophy, the phrase often comes up in the context of infinite regress - a series of propositions that require justification for each preceding proposition, with no end to the chain. This concept can be found in discussions on the nature of causation or existence, where the argument could go on \\"ad infinitum.\\" 3. Rhetoric: In literary or rhetorical contexts, \\"ad infinitum\\" typically conveys that a point or argument can be iterated indefinitely or that a certain action can be repeated endlessly. For example, when stating that history tends to repeat itself ad infinitum, it means that occurrences and patterns continue without coming to an ultimate end. 4. Arts: \\"Ad infinitum\\" is also used in art and music when referencing a composition or design created with an intention to be repetitive or limitless. For example, a musical piece with repeating motifs might be described as continuing ad infinitum, as the motifs can be played over and over without reaching an end. 5. Everyday Language: In colloquial language, people may employ \\"ad infinitum\\" to emphasize the never-ending nature of something, like when complaining about a monotonous task or discussing something that appears to have no resolution. In summary, the Latin phrase \\"ad infinitum\\" means \\"to infinity\\" or \\"endlessly,\\" and it is utilized in numerous contexts such as mathematics, philosophy, rhetoric, arts, and everyday language. The phrase is often employed to express the indefinite, infinite, or repetitive nature of an action, event, or process."},{"prompt":"After decades of debate, Brunei decided to adopt electrical vehicles and use them extensively, ultimately phasing out gasoline powered vehicles.

I was one of those children, carefree and happy. I live on a street that is only one block long. I have lived on the same street for sixteen years. I love my street. One side has six houses on it, and the other has only two houses, with a small hill in the middle and a huge cottonwood tree on one end. When I think of home, I think of my street. Only I see it as it was before. Unfortunately things change. One day, not long ago, I looked around and saw how different everything has become. Life on my street will never be the same because neighbors are quickly grown old, friends are growing up and leaving, and the city is planning to destroy my precious hill and sell the property to contractors. It is hard for me to accept that many of my wonderful neighbors are growing old and won't be around much longer. I have fond memories of the couple across the street, who sat together on their porch swing almost every evening, the widow next door who yelled at my brother and me for being too loud, and the crazy old man in a black suit who drove an old car. In contrast to those people, the people I see today are very old neighbors who have seen better days. The man in the black suit says he wants to die, and another neighbor just sold his house and moved into a nursing home. The lady who used to yell at us is too tired to bother any more, and the couple across the street rarely go out to their front porch these days. It is difficult to watch these precious people as they near the end of their lives because at once I thought they would live forever.

Styx is an American rock band from Chicago that formed in 1972 and became famous for its albums released in the late 1970s and early 1980s. They are best known for melding hard rock guitar balanced with acoustic guitar, synthesizers mixed with acoustic piano, upbeat tracks with power ballads, and incorporating elements of international musical theatre. The band established itself with a progressive rock sound in the 1970s, and began to incorporate pop rock and soft rock elements in the 1980s. Styx is best known for the hit songs \\"Lady\\", Dennis DeYoung and Tommy Shaw released a string of solo albums, beginning with DeYoung's Desert Moon and Shaw's Girls with Guns in 1984. Both Shaw and DeYoung generated a moderate amount of interest with their first solo albums. DeYoung scored a Top 10 hit with the title track, \\"Desert Moon\\", which was also heavily featured on MTV. Shaw also cracked the Top Forty with \\"Girls with Guns\\" and he made a cameo appearance on the NBC television series Miami Vice. DeYoung's follow up single \\"Don't Wait for Heroes\\" also featured a video that was heavily featured on MTV, but it failed to generate significant radio airplay, only peaking at No. 83. During the filming of the video, DeYoung injured his back, causing him to back out of opening a North American concert tour for Huey Lewis and the News. Shaw, however, did tour in the fall of 1984 as an opening act for the Kinks. Shaw's 1985 album What If and DeYoung's 1986 album Back to the World also charted, along with singles from film soundtracks. Shaw's \\"What If (Remo's Theme)\\" from Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins entered the Billboard Hot 100, while DeYoung's \\"This Is the Time\\" from The Karate Kid, Part II soundtrack was featured for a short while on MTV. The first single from DeYoung's Back to the World album, \\"Call Me\\", peaked at No. 6 on the Adult Contemporary chart and was a modest pop hit, peaking at No. 54 on the Billboard Hot 100. However, by the late 1980s, both Styx members' solo careers gradually simmered down to a modest but loyal fan base. Neither Shaw's Ambition (1987) nor DeYoung's Boomchild (1989) achieved nearly the same levels of earlier albums, although Shaw's cover of Jim Peterik's \\"Ever Since the World Began\\" charted briefly. Shaw also recorded sessions with Peterik's group, Survivor, on 1986's When Seconds Count, and Shaw's solo band opened the majority of the US shows for Rush's 1987-88 Hold Your Fire Tour. Meanwhile, James Young recorded his own solo albums: City Slicker (1985 with Jan Hammer) and Out on a Day Pass (1988), both attracting only minimal attention. In 1995 James Young partnered with other Chicago musicians and released an album under name James Young Group titled \\"Raised by Wolves\\". In 1989, Tommy Shaw formed Damn Yankees with Ted Nugent, Jack Blades and Michael Cartellone. Meanwhile, the remaining members of Styx made plans for a comeback in the new decade.

Political Editor PUBLISHED: 13:48 EST, 7 October 2013 | UPDATED: 17:59 EST, 7 October 2013 President Obama used a photo-op at a Federal Emergency Management Agency headquarters to blame Republicans for shutdown-related furloughs at the agency. But his speech made no mention of the veto threat his administration leveled at FEMA funding just three days ago. The latest round of saber-rattling on the federal government's partial shutdown came as Washington, D.C. tangled with 45-mph winds and tornado watches, and as midwestern and Gulf of Mexico states recovered from violent weekend storms and threats of devastation from Tropical Storm Karen. 'If the president and Washington","completion":"Democrats really want to help out FEMA and address the severe weather issues facing our nation,' Obama said, 'then they need to stop playing partisan politics and come together to find a solution that reopens the government and properly funds this crucial agency.' His call for unity, however, seemed to be at odds with his administration's recent actions, as just three days prior, the White House had threatened to veto a bill that would have provided much-needed funds to FEMA. The president's inconsistent messages have only added to the confusion in Washington, as both Republicans and Democrats struggle to find a path forward amidst an increasingly bitter and high-stakes political battle. With the clock ticking and the nation's emergency management system hanging in the balance, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are growing increasingly frustrated as they attempt to untangle the tangled web of politics that has enmeshed the FEMA funding issue. 'It's disheartening to see the president use an important organization like FEMA as a pawn in his political game,' said a Republican lawmaker, who asked to remain anonymous. 'If the president is serious about protecting Americans during natural disasters, he needs to put aside his partisan differences and work with Republicans to ensure that FEMA has the resources it needs.' Meanwhile, Democrats have accused Republicans of refusing to budge on critical government funding bills, asserting that the GOP's unwillingness to compromise has led to the current crisis. They argue that the only way to resolve the situation is for Republicans to end their push for budget cuts and accept a clean funding bill that would reopen the federal government and restore resources to FEMA and other vital agencies. As the standoff drags on, millions of Americans--including those in the path of severe weather events--are left to wonder if their leaders in Washington can ever put aside their differences long enough to serve the best interests of the people they were elected to represent. For now, with tornado watches, storms, and a potential hurricane looming, the fate of FEMA remains as unpredictable as the turbulent weather that threatens our nation's coastlines and communities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the person Field ask for assistance from because they needed a keyboardist? Anthony Field and Jeff Fatt were members of The Cockroaches, a Sydney pop band known for their \\"good-time R&B material\\" and several singles recorded by independent labels during the 1980s. In 1988, Field's infant niece, who was the daughter of Cockroaches founder and band member Paul Field, died of SIDS, and the group disbanded. Anthony Field enrolled at Macquarie University in Sydney to complete his degree in early childhood education, and later stated that his niece's death \\"ultimately led to the formation of [The] Wiggles\\". Murray Cook, also \\"a mature-aged student\\", was the guitarist in the pub rock band Bang Shang a Lang before enrolling at Macquarie. Greg Page, who had been a roadie for and sang with The Cockroaches during their final years, had enrolled in Macquarie to study early childhood education on Field's recommendation. Field, Cook, and Page were among approximately 10 men in a program with 200 students.In 1991, while still a student, Field became motivated to use concepts in the field of early childhood education to record an album of music for children. The album was dedicated to Field's niece. A song he wrote for The Cockroaches, \\"Get Ready to Wiggle\\", inspired the band's name because they thought that wiggling described the way children dance. Like a university assignment, they produced a folder of essays that explained the educational value of each song on the album. They needed a keyboardist \\"to bolster the rock'n'roll feel of the project\\", so Field asked his old bandmate Fatt for his assistance in what they thought would be a temporary project.The group received songwriting help from John Field, Anthony's brother and former bandmate, and from Phillip Wilcher, who was working with the early childhood music program at Macquarie. After contributing to their first album, hosting the group's first recording sessions in his Sydney home, and appearing in a couple of the group's first videos, Wilcher left the group and went into classical music. The group reworked a few Cockroaches tunes... Answer:","completion":"Jeff Fatt"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? mike leigh populates his movie with a wonderful ensemble cast of characters that bring the routine day to day struggles of the working class to life","completion":"The sentiment of the sentence provided is predominantly positive. Let's analyze the key elements of the sentence to understand why this is the case. 1. \\"Mike Leigh populates his movie\\" - This part of the sentence does not carry a clear positive or negative sentiment, as it simply states an action by Mike Leigh, referring to the director and his movie. 2. \\"wonderful ensemble cast of characters\\" - This specific phrase indicates a strong positive sentiment. The word \\"wonderful\\" is an adjective often used for praising or showing appreciation, and the fact that the ensemble cast is referred to as 'wonderful' suggests that the writer is extremely impressed with the choice and performance of the actors. 3. \\"bring the routine day to day struggles\\" - This part of the sentence sets the scene and clarifies what the actors do within the movie. While the topic of \\"struggles\\" might suggest negativity, it is important to understand that, in this instance, the word is being used as a description of a concept within the movie rather than an opinion on it. 4. \\"working-class to life\\" - The last part of the sentence communicates that the ensemble cast accurately portrays the life of the working class, allowing the audience to connect with and understand their daily experiences. This is also a positive sentiment, as it highlights the movie's effectiveness in realistically presenting the struggles of the working class. In conclusion, the overall sentiment of the sentence is positive. The author expresses a strong appreciation for the ensemble cast that Mike Leigh selects for his movie, emphasizing their ability to portray the daily struggles of the working class vividly and believably. Even though the topic of the struggles may suggest potential negativity, its context within the sentence is a narrative description and should not be misinterpreted as a negative sentiment."},{"prompt":"Question: Cees Nooteboom - Cees Nooteboom (born 31 July 1933) is a Dutch novelist poet and journalist.

After seeing Jeremy Brett as Sherlock Holmes, no actor should ever display such conceit as to imagine that he could ever come close to Mr. Brett's portrayal of \\"one of the most interesting characters in literature\\".

This unequivocal endorsement of Jeremy Brett's performances and his place as the ultimate Sherlock Holmes indicates that the reviewer harbors an overwhelmingly positive opinion of the movie. Rogers even suggests that the book on this matter should be closed once and for all, leaving the public to revel in the unmatched uniqueness of Mr. Brett's portrayal of the famed detective. Other aspects contributing to the positive nature of the review include the acknowledgment of the \\"absolutely top-notch productions\\" which added to Brett's performances, and the generous tip of the hat towards Basil Rathbone as a close second,although still incomparable to Brett's Holmes.

Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Greenwich is on the River, five miles from the middle of London, and its history is two thousand years old. The first English people were fishermen there, and they named the place Greenwich, meaning \\"green village\\". Later the English kings and queens lived at Greenwich in their beautiful places. The name of the earliest palace was Placentia. Its windows were made of glass--the first in England. But trouble was coming to Greenwich. In 1649, a war started in England and for eleven years there was no king. The men who had worked for him at Placentia decided to live in the place themselves. They sold all its beautiful things, and bought small pieces of the palace garden with money. Finally, the war ended and King Charles II came back. But Placentia was falling down. So King Charles built a new and bigger palace, which is now open to the public. At this time, Charles was worried about losing so many of its ships at sea because their sailors did not know how to tell exactly where they were. So in 1675, Charles made John Flamsteed, the first astronomer in England, try to find the answer. Flamsteed worked in a new building on the high ground in Greenwich Park. From it with a telescope which he made himself, Flamsteed could look all round the sky. And he did, night after night, for twenty years. Carrying on Flamsteed's work a hundred years later, an astronomer called Harrison finally made a clock which told the time at sea, and helped sailors to know where they were.You can see Harrison's clock, still working, in Greenwich's museum of the sea. Because of Flamsteed's work, every country in the world now tells its time by Greenwich time.

A better answer to the question would discuss the various types of international instruments that can create confusion when trying to understand a treaty, like conventions, protocols, and agreements, explaining the differences between them and why it may result in confusion. A detailed response could be: Convention, protocol, and agreement are examples of different types of international legal instruments that can create confusion when discussing treaties. This confusion can arise due to the varied terminology and the specific purposes each type of instrument serves. However, it is important to note that these terms often overlap in usage, as all of them are tools used to create legally binding obligations for their signatory countries. A convention is a formal agreement between nations that usually deals with a specific subject matter. Typically, conventions are used when addressing broad issues of a general nature, establishing a legal framework and principles for cooperation between the signatory parties. An example of a convention is the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which governs the rights and duties of nations in relation to the world's oceans and maritime areas. A protocol, on the other hand, is an additional legal instrument that complements, modifies, or amends an existing treaty or convention. Protocols are used to address specific aspects of a primary agreement that may require further elaboration or regulation. For example, the Kyoto Protocol is an addition to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and it specifies targets and commitments for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by developed countries. Agreements, which can also be referred to as treaties, compacts, or covenants, cover a wide range of subject matters and formats. They can be bilateral (between two countries) or multilateral (among several countries), and they may deal with issues as varied as trade, environmental protection, or diplomatic relations. Agreements can be either formal, like the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), or more informal, like a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between countries. The confusion surrounding the various terms can be attributed to the fact that there is no strict hierarchy or categorization for these instruments. In general, each term can be used interchangeably, although their specific meanings may vary depending on the context in which they are used. As a result, people may find it difficult to differentiate between the terms or understand the full implications of a particular document, which could potentially lead to misunderstandings or misconceptions regarding the legal obligations and responsibilities of the parties involved. Therefore, it is essential to pay attention to the context and scope of each instrument to better comprehend its purpose and effect in international law."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Given the below context: Sir Henry Joseph Wood (3 March 1869 – 19 August 1944) was an English conductor best known for his association with London's annual series of promenade concerts, known as the Proms. He conducted them for nearly half a century, introducing hundreds of new works to British audiences. After his death, the concerts were officially renamed in his honour as the \\"Henry Wood Promenade Concerts\\", although they continued to be generally referred to as \\"the Proms\\". Born in modest circumstances to parents who encouraged his musical talent, Wood started his career as an organist. During his studies at the Royal Academy of Music, he came under the influence of the voice teacher Manuel Garcia and became his accompanist. After similar work for Richard D'Oyly Carte's opera companies on the works of Arthur Sullivan and others, Wood became the conductor of a small operatic touring company. He was soon engaged by the larger Carl Rosa Opera Company. One notable event in his operatic career was conducting the British premiere of Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin in 1892. From the mid-1890s until his death, Wood focused on concert conducting. He was engaged by the impresario Robert Newman to conduct a series of promenade concerts at the Queen's Hall, offering a mixture of classical and popular music at low prices. The series was successful, and Wood conducted annual promenade series until his death in 1944. By the 1920s, Wood had steered the repertoire entirely to classical music. When the Queen's Hall was destroyed by bombing in 1941, the Proms moved to the Royal Albert Hall. Wood declined the chief conductorships of the New York Philharmonic and Boston Symphony Orchestras, believing it his duty to serve music in the United Kingdom. In addition to the Proms, he conducted concerts and festivals throughout the country and also trained the student orchestra at the Royal Academy of Music. He had an enormous influence on the musical life of Britain over his long career: he and Newman greatly improved access to classical music, and Wood... Guess a valid title for it!

Which one of the following options would the answer to this be?","completion":"Mormons, also known as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, have a unique set of beliefs that set them apart from other Christian denominations. Their principal beliefs can be categorized into several core areas including the nature of God, the plan of salvation, scripture, religious authority, and the afterlife. 1. Nature of God: Mormons believe in the existence of God the Father, His son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost. These three beings are separate entities, which Mormons often refer to as the Godhead. However, they are united in purpose, working together for the salvation and exaltation of mankind. God the Father and Jesus Christ are believed to have physical, tangible bodies of flesh and bones, while the Holy Ghost is a personage of spirit that communicates God's influence and guidance to individuals. 2. Plan of Salvation: Central to Mormon beliefs is the plan of salvation, which encompasses the purpose of life on Earth, the role of Jesus Christ, and the progression of individuals toward exaltation. This plan is often referred to as the \\"Great Plan of Happiness.\\" According to Mormon doctrine, God's purpose in creating the earth was to provide a place where His children could grow and progress spiritually by learning to choose between good and evil. Jesus Christ's atoning sacrifice is seen as the focal point of this plan, making it possible for all individuals to be forgiven and cleansed of their sins, ultimately allowing them to return to live with God eternally. 3. Scripture: Mormons believe in the Bible as the word of God, but they also accept additional volumes of scripture as sacred and authoritative. These include the Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price. The Book of Mormon is viewed as an ancient historical record of God's dealings with the people living in the Americas, while the Doctrine and Covenants contains revelations given to Latter-day prophets, including Joseph Smith, the founding prophet of the Church. The Pearl of Great Price is a compilation of various historical texts, translations, and revelations that cover topics such as the nature of God, the creation of the world, and the story of Moses. 4. Religious Authority: Mormons believe that God continues to guide and direct His Church today through living prophets and apostles. Joseph Smith, who founded the Church in 1830, is considered the first prophet of the modern era. Prophets and apostles have the authority to receive revelation from God, provide guidance and direction to Church members, and administer priesthood authority necessary for essential ordinances, such as baptism. Current Church leaders are viewed as successors to Joseph Smith, and the current prophet and president of the Church stands as the foremost spiritual authority for Mormons. 5. The afterlife: Mormons have a distinctive understanding of the afterlife, which can be divided into three main realms: the pre-mortal existence, mortal life, and the post-mortal life. The pre-mortal existence is the premortal spiritual realm where the spirits of all human beings lived with God before coming to earth. The mortal life on earth is a period of testing and growth, where individuals are given a physical body and the opportunity to learn from their experiences, including their mistakes. Finally, the post-mortal life encompasses a temporary spirit world followed by the resurrection and final judgment, resulting in one of three degrees of glory in the afterlife: the Celestial, Terrestrial, and Telestial kingdoms. In conclusion, the Mormon faith is grounded in beliefs regarding the nature of God, the plan of salvation, scripture, religious authority, and the afterlife. These beliefs, largely based on additional sacred scriptures and the authority of modern prophets and apostles, make The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints unique within Christianity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Paragraph: Independence with Partition: The British began to see India's independence as inevitable; however, only a few seemed to understand the vital role of the religious groups. Britain prepared a parliamentary democracy with majority rule, but the majority were Hindus — and Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs had been killing each other in war for many centuries. Nehru's Congress Party, largely Hindu with a socialist leadership, wanted a parliamentary democracy. As counterweight, British legislation reserved parliamentary seats for religious minorities, but the Punjab and Bengal had such a complicated mixture of Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs that it was not possible to avoid fights over how separate constituencies were to be formed. The seeds of future trouble were sown. The legislation on reserving seats gave the Muslims the basis for an alternative to an India in which they were only a quarter of the population: Partition. In 1930, the poet Muhammad Iqbal proposed a separate Muslim homeland in the northwest of India. A small group of Indian Muslims at Cambridge came up with the name Pakistan, using the initials of the Punjab, Afghania (N.W. Frontier Province), Kashmir, and Sind (at the same time producing the word pak, meaning \\"pure\\"), and adding \\"stan,\\" the Persian suffix for the word \\"country. \\" The Muslim campaign for Partition was led by London-trained Bombay lawyer, Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Meanwhile, Gandhi vehemently opposed any dismemberment of the country, and tried to keep people united by fasting to uphold the spirit of love, and by focussing on the common adversary: the British. Advocating civil disobedience, he led his famous Salt March to the sea, to scoop up salt and circumvent the hated British salt tax. This put more than 60,000 in jail. Against this militancy, World War II did not elicit the solidarity of the first. Indians courageously fought alongside the British troops, in Burma, the Middle East, and Europe, but Gandhi saw the British as a provocation for Japanese invasion and was jailed yet again, for launching a \\"Quit India\\" campaign in the year 1942. Some anti-British extremists saw the Japanese as an Asian liberator. Winston Churchill didn't want any Indian independence and so it was probably as well for India that he was defeated by Attlee's Labor Party in 1945. With riots growing ever more bloody in Bengal, Bihar, and the Punjab, India's last viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, kept a mandate to make the British departure as quick and as smooth as possible. Quick it was — six months after his arrival — but not smooth.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. There should be a rule that states quite clearly that movies like Resident Evil are supposed to be made in the spirit of the game, not in the spirit of blowing up everything possible. RE was a survival horror game, and a damn effective one at that, yet Paul WS Anderson managed to make it like any other video game movie to come along. Alone in the Dark is essentially the same kind of a spirit as Resident Evil, so of course, there is the slight hope the director will manage to have some piece of a brain enough to make a horror movie and not an action movie. Instead, Alone in the Dark just proves that there is no longer hope for video games becoming movies. The plot, despite the fact that it obviously isn't supposed to matter, is the largest of many problems with the movie. The movie starts with what can only be described as five minutes of scrolling text that may or may not be important, as after a minute passes, the audience stops caring and just sits through the rest hitting the object closest to them. Then there's something about an orphanage, some artefacts, an ancient tribe, some bureaucracy and some demons, all of which get so jumbled together that the viewers really can't follow with what is going on. Characters move in and out of the plot like candy, some having huge build-ups for meaningless deaths. Basically, what I can understand is that some demons got released, and Edward Carnby (Slater) has some link to them thanks to some operation given to children in his orphanage which has failed on him. He finds an artefact involving the demons and brings it to an ex-girlfriend anthropologist (Reid), who of course he manages to have sex with right away for no good reason. Then, out of nowhere, all hell breaks loose, and the pair end up with a military team led by some asshole commander (Dorff), who apparently has a mutual hatred for Carnby. It's all ridiculous, and the reason I don't really understand it isn't just because it's complicated and jumbled, but it leaves no room for anyone to really care. Instead, I highly recommend that, if you must see this film, bring a tennis ball or something to occupy yourself when the plot manages to bore you into confusion. The action scenes in a movie with a plot as terrible as this should at least bring it up a little, right? Too bad, this movie is like any other ruined crap ever made, with enough quick cuts to behead a coop of chickens. Considering that this is based on a horror game, not an action game, it is especially annoying. The first action scene involving a man chasing Cranby from a taxi is among the worst I have ever had to witness, and the rest isn't all that great either. The demons look somewhat cool, though the fact that they turn into powder when killed takes away all that effect. Scenes involving lots of guns which should be cool to watch instead involve the muzzle fire as the only source of light and the camera zooming and panning faster than the head of a crack addict. It's all the kind of seizure inducing crap that keeps children in bed at night. The acting is what I like to call taking actors and making them do nothing. Slater does nothing but sound important for the whole movie, though he does seem to have more talent than he is letting on. The same is true of Dorff, who gets a thankless role despite actually having some talent (something that has happened to him a lot). Reid is pretty much exactly what she should be, background sex appeal, as whenever she tries to act it is a disaster (as is the incredibly bad scientist look she has in the beginning). In all, this is the type of movie that worries me about future video game movies. If they keep ruining the spirit like this, it's only a matter of time before Samus Aran is killing Middle-Easterns with an AK-47 and Tommy Vercetti is fighting a squadron of aliens. Unlike Resident Evil, however, this one doesn't deserve a second chance, as I don't think anything could possibly help me forget just how terrible this movie is. It's bland, uninteresting and unexciting. This is the movie equivalent of diarrhea; it's all thrown together, nothing really fits and, in the end, you're just glad it's over.

If you beat a dog in Schuylkill County, you'll probably get a 100 fine. If you repeatedly beat a woman, you'll probably get the same fine. In 2001, county judges heard 98 Protection From Abuse cases, finding the defendant guilty in 48 percent of those cases, either after a hearing or through a technical violation or plea. Of those found guilty, the majority were ordered to pay court costs, plus a 100 fine. No defendants were ordered to pay more than a 250 fine for violating the court order. In 27 percent of the cases, the charges were dismissed or the defendant was found not guilty. In the rest of the cases, charges were withdrawn or the matter is not yet resolved. Sarah T. Casey, executive director of Schuylkill Women in Crisis, finds it disturbing that in most cases, the fine for violating a PFA is little more than the fine someone would get for cruelty and abuse toward an animal. \\"In most of the counties surrounding Schuylkill County, the penalties given for indirect criminal contempt are much stiffer than those in Schuylkill County,\\" Casey said. \\"What kind of message are we sending those who repeatedly violate Protection From Abuse orders? That it's OK to abuse women in Schuylkill County, because you'll only get a slap on the wrist?\\" Under state law, the minimum fine for contempt of a PFA is 100; the maximum fine is 1,000 and up to six months in jail. Like others who are familiar with how the county's legal system does and doesn't work for victims of domestic violence, Casey believes some changes are in order. Valerie West, a manager/attorney with Mid-Penn Legal Services, with offices in Pottsville and Reading, regularly handles domestic violence cases. She finds fault with the local requirement that a custody order must be established within 30 days after a PFA is filed. West said she feels a custody order should be allowed to stand for the full term of the PFA - up to 18 months - as it does in many other counties in the state. \\"It places an undue burden on the plaintiff, in terms of cost, finding legal representation and facing their abuser - not to mention a further burden on the system to provide those services,\\" West said. \\"It may be difficult for the parties to reach an agreement so soon after violence has occurred.

Input: Passage: On a moonlit, tropical night, the native workers are asleep in their outdoor barracks. A shot is heard; the door of a house opens and a man stumbles out of it, followed by a woman who calmly shoots him several more times, the last few while standing over his body. The woman is Leslie Crosbie, the wife of a British rubber plantation manager in Malaya; the man whom she shot is recognized by her manservant as Geoff Hammond, a well-regarded member of the European community. Leslie tells the servant to send for her husband Robert, who is working at one of the plantations. Her husband returns, having summoned his attorney and a British police inspector. Leslie tells them that Geoff Hammond \\"tried to make love to me\\" and that she killed him to save her honor. Leslie is placed under arrest and put in jail in Singapore to await trial for murder; that she killed a man makes such a trial inevitable, but her eventual acquittal seems a foregone conclusion, as the white community accepts her story and believes she acted heroically. Only her attorney, Howard Joyce, is rather suspicious. Howard's suspicions seem justified when his clerk, Ong Chi Seng, shows him a copy of a letter Leslie wrote to Hammond the day she killed him, telling him that her husband would be away that evening, and pleading with him to come—implicitly threatening him if he did not come. Ong Chi Seng tells Howard that the original letter is in the possession of Hammond's widow, a Eurasian woman who lives in the Chinese quarter of town. The letter is for sale, and Ong himself, whom Howard had believed to be impeccable, stands to receive a substantial cut of the price. Howard then confronts Leslie with the damning evidence and she breaks down and confesses to having written it, though she stands by her claim of having killed Hammond in self-defence. Yet Leslie cleverly manipulates the attorney into agreeing to buy back the letter, even though in doing so he will risk his own freedom and career.

There is a little girl, which we can classify as a child. 2. She is wearing a red dress. 3. She is standing on a trail, which implies an outdoor location. 4. The setting is described as a forest, further indicating an outdoor environment. 5. There is a horse in the background, which is an animal. Now, let's analyze the second sentence: \\"A child is outside in view of an animal.\\" This sentence broadly summarizes some key points from the original sentence: 1. A little girl can be considered a child, so the \\"child\\" description is accurate. 2. The sentence does not specify the child's attire, but this is not crucial to determining the truth of the statement. 3. The child being outside is supported by the mention of a trail in the forest in the original sentence. 4.

There are multiple factors to consider. Firstly, the premise states that Ireland's political organization continued much as it had under pagan Celtic rule, but it does not provide specific details about the efficiency or effectiveness of that political organization. In other words, while there is continuity in the political structure's characteristics, it does not directly entail that the government was functioning at a high level of performance. Additionally, even if the government's structure stayed the same, other external factors might have contributed to its efficiency or lack thereof. For instance, the socio-economic situation, levels of education, and prevailing attitudes might have differed between the periods, impacting government operations in various ways. Furthermore, different leaders may have held power during this time, which could have led to alterations in governance styles, approaches, and overall effectiveness. Without knowing the specifics about these leaders and their ability to govern successfully, it remains unclear whether the government was working well at that time. Lastly, it is essential to recognize that \\"working well\\" can be subjective and depends on the criteria being used to evaluate the government's effectiveness. For some, a government works well if it maintains stability and order, while others might value other aspects, such as citizen participation, human rights, or economic prosperity. Without knowing the measuring standards, it is impossible to determine if the government was functioning well during this period. In conclusion, based on the premise given, it is not possible to tell whether the government was working well at that time.

Summarize this article: The black-footed ferret, North America's rarest mammal, is returning to the western prairie 35 years after being declared extinct. The comeback trail for Mustela nigripes began in 1981, when a ranch dog with a dead ferret in its mouth led to the rediscovery of a remnant population near Meeteetse in northwestern Wyoming. (See stunning pictures of the rarest animals on Earth.) The last 18 survivors of that population formed the seed stock for a captive-breeding program that reintroduced the species to its former range at 25 sites from southernmost Canada to northern Mexico. Yet numbers in the wild remain low—fewer than 500, according to Peter Gober, recovery coordinator at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's National Black-Footed Ferret Conservation Center in Carr, Colorado. A major hurdle is disease, particularly sylvatic plague, a flea-borne infection that appeared in North America in the early 1900s. Because the disease is non-native, the black-footed ferret—a member of the weasel family—has no natural resistance; neither does its prey, the prairie dog. (Related: [Video] \\"Why Do Prairie Dogs Do 'The Wave'?\\") Prairie dogs are \\"pretty much all the ferrets eat,\\" Gober says. They also \\"provide shelter, because the ferrets make use of their burrows. \\"There are quite a few prairie dogs in the West still, despite the fact that they've been reduced by 90 percent plus since historical times,\\" he adds. \\"The problem is that they fluctuate wildly, due to drought and because of this plague.\\" The reintroduced ferret populations mirror these fluctuations. They \\"come and go\\" like \\"lights blinking on a Christmas tree,\\" Gober says. (Read about how scientists decide what species to save.) Repopulating ferrets over a wide range of their old territory helps manage the risk of disease, but that requires access to suitable land with plenty of prairie dogs. \\"There's a lot of raw habitat out there, but it's degraded,\\" Gober says. Such habitat is typically found on livestock ranches, where historically prairie dogs haven't been welcome. Because they compete with cattle for grass, millions were exterminated during the past century. Wealthy landowners like media mogul Ted Turner are already on board with the program, but accommodating the ferrets' increasing need for habitat will require financial support for the ranching community in return for tolerating significant numbers of prairie dogs. The Natural Resources Conservation Service, a division of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, so far has provided about a million dollars to a dozen landowners in Colorado, and hopes to expand the program to other states. New hope also comes in the form of a recently developed vaccine to combat sylvatic plague. Meanwhile, Gober and his colleagues in Colorado are breeding some 250 black-footed ferrets annually. ||||| Rancher Gary Walker squats in his cowboy boots and jeans and rests a small animal carrier against a black-tailed prairie dog hole before swinging the door open. He's careful to keep his hands out of the way. \\"These are little vicious guys, too,\\" Walker says, with a laugh. \\"I just love 'em.\\" The black-footed ferret inside is timid at first, and buries herself in the shredded paper of her enclosure. But with a little coaxing, she bounds into the hole, than peeps her head out to stare across 65,000 acres of flat, short-grass prairie that will be her new home. Her pink snout twitches. Her eyes blink behind a Zorro-like mask of black fur. If all goes well, this little girl and her buddies will live to be 3 or 4 years old here on Walker's Turkey Creek Ranch, located between Fort Carson and Pueblo West. They'll live in prairie dog holes, emerging mostly at night, when they'll search from burrow to burrow until they find a sleeping prairie dog, which they'll bite on the neck and asphyxiate with their slinky bodies. A ferret can live on a prairie dog corpse for about three days before killing again. She and the 18 others being released today could produce as many as four litters, usually of three to four kits, but sometimes as few as one or as many as 10. Less than a year after they're born, the young males will begin mostly solitary lives. The females hopefully will grow up and have families of their own. But there's plenty of things that could cut these ferrets' lives short. Luckily, since Gary Walker and his wife Georgia have agreed to allow the ferrets and prairie dogs to live on their land (and have already set aside over 21,888 acres as a conservation easement that will never be developed), they won't be poisoned or otherwise killed. \\"Before we're through, we hope that from Penrose to Piñon and across the Arkansas River, our holdings, the Walker Ranch holdings, will never be part of a development,\\" Gary Walker says. \\"These will be open spaces forever, where the ferrets can roam free.\\" Prairie dogs, which live throughout the Great Plains, as far north as Canada and as far south as Mexico, have often been targeted by ranchers who say they compete too heavily with cattle for grass, or by farmers who see them as pests. They now cover less than 2 percent of their former territory. And as the prairie dogs have disappeared, so have the ferrets, which in a natural setting help keep prairie dog populations in check. A huge part of the problem for both has been Sylvatic plague, which was brought from overseas ages ago, and canine distemper. Both diseases spread quickly and are fatal. Ferrets can also fall prey to any number of predators. \\"They have a tough, short little life,\\" says John Hughes, a wildlife biologist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. But for the black-footed ferret, the only American species of ferret, which was nearly extinct not so long ago, any kind of life is a gift. And it's only through a massive effort involving federal and state agencies, nonprofits, tribes and landowners that they're finally making a comeback. The black-footed ferret has been thought extinct twice. They were assumed gone in the late 1950s, but in 1964 a small population was found in Mellette County, S.D. Scientists attempted to breed some of them in captivity but were unsuccessful. The last one died in 1979. Then, in 1981, a ranch dog dragged a strange-looking creature home near Meeteetse, Wyo. The rancher brought it to a taxidermist, who identified it and called government officials. The population that was found peaked to 129 ferrets in 1984, but it was hit hard by disease. Between 1985 and 1987, 24 were captured, 18 of whom survived. Seven bred. And from that, we now have hundreds of ferrets, both in the wild and in captivity. Della Garelle, a veterinarian and director of field conservation at Cheyenne Mountain Zoo, estimates that there might be around 800 of them alive. The zoo, which is one of five breeding sites in the country, has 28. It's been a breeding site since 1990, at a cost of hundreds of thousands of dollars. It also breeds other endangered species. Visitors don't usually see any of those animals. Garelle works with the other breeding sites, trading ferrets to maintain a carefully tracked balance of the genes of the original seven breeding ferrets. Many end up in Wellington, Colo., at the National Black-Footed Ferret Conservation Center. Hughes, the wildlife biologist, is one of the center staff that helps the ferrets at the facility, which he says is \\"basically a walled-in prairie dog town.\\" There, kits learn to hunt prairie dogs. The successful ones are considered for re-entry into the wild. They're only released in areas where they'll be relatively safe, and where there is a healthy prairie dog community that covers at least 2,000 acres. Even then, it's risky. Reintroduced populations are still wiped out by disease at times. While captive ferrets can be inoculated, their kits are harder to protect. Scientists travel to some of the wild places where they're released, to try and capture and inoculate new generations, but it's difficult work. Areas where ferrets live are also often dusted with pesticides to cut back on insects that can be vectors for disease. Scientists are currently working on an oral plague inoculation that could be baited to prairie dogs, hopefully creating \\"herd immunity.\\" \\"We could recover the species,\\" Hughes says, \\"without plague.\\" Prairie dogs are what is known as a \\"keystone species\\" — one with a disproportionate effect on its environment. That's because the holes they create help water reach plant roots in the arid West and provide homes for other animals, like the ferret, burrowing owls and swift fox. They're also prey for many species. But getting ranchers to stop killing prairie dogs has been difficult, and the release of ferrets wasn't even widely allowed in the state until the passage of 2013's Colorado Senate Bill 169, which allowed their release on private land with a landowner's consent, so long as the owners had signed on to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services' Safe Harbor Agreement. Safe Harbor offers incentives to landowners who agree to allow the government to manage an endangered species on their land. Landowners can't purposely kill the animals, but the program protects them if they accidentally kill animals in the general use of their land. The Walkers were considered trailblazers for allowing ferrets on their land, and dozens have been released there this year and last year. Several other property owners in the state have since allowed the ferrets on their land, and some public lands are also seeing ferrets introduced since the passage of 2014's Colorado House Bill 1267, which allowed for that. Tom Warren, the retired environmental program director for the Department of the Army at Fort Carson who has worked for years to bring back the ferret, says the key to recovering the species will be ongoing cooperation between experts and the environmental stewardship of ranchers. \\"It was golden opportunity,\\" he says of slow recovery of the ferrets, \\"that basically came to pass because a whole lot of us were dedicated to it and made it happen.\\" ||||| Summary:","completion":"The black-footed ferret, which is North America's rarest mammal, is returning to the western prairie 35 years after it was declared extinct.

Detailed Instructions: In this task, you need to provide the parts-of-speech tag of a word present in a sentence specified within curly braces ( '{{ ... }}' ). The parts-of-speech tags are coarse labels that represent a category of words with similar grammatical properties. The list of part-of-speech tags i.e. tagset of this corpus is 'ADJ': Adjectives are words that typically modify nouns and specify their properties or attributes, 'ADP': Adposition is a cover term for prepositions and postpositions, 'ADV': Adverbs are words that typically modify verbs for such categories as time, place, direction or manner, 'AUX': An auxiliary is a function word that accompanies the lexical verb of a verb phrase and expresses grammatical distinctions not carried by the lexical verb, such as person, number, tense, mood, aspect, voice or evidentiality, 'CCONJ': A coordinating conjunction is a word that links words or larger constituents without syntactically subordinating one to the other and expresses a semantic relationship between them, 'DET': Determiners are words that modify nouns or noun phrases and express the reference of the noun phrase in context, 'INTJ': An interjection is a word that is used most often as an exclamation or part of an exclamation, 'NOUN': Nouns are a part of speech typically denoting a person, place, thing, animal or idea, 'NUM': A numeral is a word, functioning most typically as a determiner, adjective or pronoun, that expresses a number and a relation to the number, such as quantity, sequence, frequency or fraction, 'PART': Particles are function words that must be associated with another word or phrase to impart meaning and that do not satisfy definitions of other universal parts of speech, 'PRON': Pronouns are words that substitute for nouns or noun phrases, whose meaning is recoverable from the linguistic or extralinguistic context, 'PROPN': A proper noun is a noun (or nominal content word) that is the name (or part of the name) of a specific individual, place, or object, 'PUNCT': Punctuation marks are non-alphabetical characters and character groups used in many languages to delimit linguistic units in printed text, 'SCONJ': A subordinating conjunction is a conjunction that links constructions by making one of them a constituent of the other. The subordinating conjunction typically marks the incorporated constituent which has the status of a (subordinate) clause, 'SYM': A symbol is a word-like entity that differs from ordinary words by form, function or both, 'VERB': A verb is a member of the syntactic class of words that typically signal events and actions, can constitute a minimal predicate in a clause, and govern the number and types of other constituents which may occur in the clause, 'X': The tag X is used for words that for some reason cannot be assigned a real part-of-speech category.

The first statement, \\"Two boys performing what appears to be a kissing scene in a lunchroom,\\" describes a particular event or situation involving two individuals. This could be any event at any location, and the individuals involved do not have a specified relationship or purpose. This statement is purely observational and describes a single occurrence without further context. On the other hand, the second statement, \\"Indiana Jones writes poetry,\\" provides information about a fictional character named Indiana Jones, who is known for his adventures as an archaeologist in popular movies. This statement gives us insight into an unexpected hobby or interest of Indiana Jones, showing that he has a creative side in addition to his more action-oriented pursuits. There is no logical connection or evidence that connects these two statements. To conclude that these two statements are related, a reasonable link or context is required, which is absent in this case. However, one could attempt to combine the two statements into a more coherent and connected scenario by providing additional context or information. For example: \\"Indiana Jones writes a poem about an emotional scene between two boys during lunchtime, which inspires the boys to reenact it as a form of performance art.\\" In this context, there is a clear connection between Indiana Jones' poetic writing and the event involving the two boys. But in the original statements given, there is no logical or reasonable basis to connect the two.

Write a summary based on this article: ........................................................................................................................................................................................ My column this morning, an obituary of sorts for an old New Mexico Douglas fir named “Yoda” , was a chance to reconnect with scientists I’ve been talking to, and science I’ve been writing about, for a long time. I stumbled on Henri Grissino-Mayer’s work on the trees of the Malpais by accident back in the 1990s, which led to one of the first stories I ever did on the tree ring record of long term drought in New Mexico Yoda figured prominently in a science book for middle school kids I wrote five years ago. But Yoda, while charismatic, is far from the oldest Douglas fir out at the Malpais. When we were talking last week, Henri pointed to this, a list kept by tree ring scientists of the oldest known trees of various species around the world. It reports that one of Yoda’s kin, just down the road near Bandera Ice Cave, is 1,275 years old. ||||| .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — Yoda, a 7-foot-tall Douglas fir on the lava flows south of Grants, died this summer at the age of 650 or so. An icon for scientists studying the history of New Mexico’s climate, Yoda survived many a drought. But the tree couldn’t get through the latest one, said University of Tennessee professor Henri Grissino-Mayer. Yoda was alive in March, according to Grant Harley of the University of Mississippi, one of a posse of researchers who have been tracking the tree. But when Harley brought a group of students to the remote site in August, the tree was dead. “Bummer,” Harley wrote in an email sharing the news. “We had a moment of silence to pay our respects.” Grissino-Mayer was a graduate student in 1991 when he and a colleague found Yoda among a stand of Douglas fir trees growing out of a lava flow at El Malpais National Monument south of Grants. Douglas firs can grow 150 feet tall or more. Yoda was maybe 7 feet tall. But when Grissino-Mayer carefully removed a pencil-thin core of wood (this doesn’t harm the trees) to count Yoda’s annual growth rings, he found that the tree had been alive since at least 1406. Gnarled, with a head of dead branches and a few live ones springing from his crown, Yoda looked every bit the wise elder. “Size,” as the tree’s Star Wars namesake said, “matters not.” “He became kind of our spokes-tree out there,” Grissino-Mayer recalled when I phoned him last week to reminisce about the life and times of Yoda the Douglas fir. The wisdom found in Yoda’s rings, and the rings of the other trees of the Malpais, has been crucial to our understanding of the history of New Mexico’s climate. Under the right circumstances, trees like the Douglas fir of the Malpais put on wider growth rings during wet years, and thinner ones during dry years. By counting back the years, and measuring many trees, Grissino-Mayer and other tree ring scientists have assembled a chronology of New Mexico’s droughts and wet spells. It tells us far more than we would know simply by looking at the records kept in the past few hundred years that measurements have been taken. Yoda and the other Douglas firs of the Malpais are especially useful, Grissino-Mayer said, because their remote and rugged location means they’ve been largely unmolested by the press of humanity that makes many forests hard for the tree ring scientists to work in. If you’ve ever tried to walk across the lava flow, you’ll understand why logging and ranching have had no impact on Yoda. One of the things Yoda and company have told us is that New Mexico has been subject to droughts far longer than we have experienced in the modern era. Among the worst was a period in which Yoda and the other trees show thin rings and therefore dry weather for half a century beginning in the mid-1500s, including an awful 25-year stretch from 1575 to 1600, according to Grissino-Mayer. “Yoda lived through it,” Grissino-Mayer said. By the numbers, the current drought does not approach the great megadrought of the 16th century. It’s been going on for 15 years. Twelve of the past 15 years have been drier than the long-term average in New Mexico, and 13 of them have been warmer than average. But comparisons are complicated by the fact that, although the current drought has been shorter, the warm weather has been particularly tough on trees, according to research by former Los Alamos National Laboratory scientist Park Williams. A new study by the U.S. Forest Service’s Rocky Mountain Research Station noted “increasing mortality and declining growth” in the state’s forests in the past decade. Grissino-Mayer is cautious about comparisons between the current situation and the megadrought of Yoda’s youth. Fifteen years is not enough, he said, to draw conclusions. “We can’t really say yet that this is a worse drought, because I don’t think this drought has ended,” he said. Grissino-Mayer plans to return to New Mexico in the next year to study what’s happening, including gathering data on how many of Yoda’s aging kin also have perished in the current drought. In the meantime, Harley found a cone at Yoda’s feet, and plans are underway to try to grow new trees from the seed. “Hopefully,” Harley said, “there will be Yoda descendants.” UpFront is a daily front-page opinion column.

There is so much wrong with the film you can't help but be amazed at how bad it really is. This movie had so much potential to be good, but ultimately made nothing of it. The characters were as dumb as one can be; for the entire movie you're just asking yourself \\"why would you do that?\\" or \\"what's your point in doing this?\\"...this is how illogical and stupid the characters are. We get NO background into them, so naturally you really don't give a rats as about their fate...you could only laugh at their stupidity. - The 'slut' (Marcy) for instance... was she that horny that she had to sleep with Paul (Rider Strong)? There was no point in that....its almost as if the filmmakers needed a excuse to give her the virus so voila! UGH. - Would anyone really go into the woods and drink water from the faucet of a cabin WITHOUT looking at it first? - Why didn't Bert just shoot the sick guy from the start? Movie would've been over that way....besides, they ended up killing him anyway. - Why did it take them so long to finally decide to leave the cabin, even if they had to walk? 'No, I'll just wait until 2 of my friends are infected (one a blink away from death) to finally opt to walk outta there. - What was exactly the reasoning behind Paul's attempt to fish out the body of the Hermit, only to fall in the contaminated reservoir and get infected with the virus? Pure STUPIDITY! I swear, common sense was not a friend, much less an aquaintance to these idiots. I don't think there has ever been a worse ending to a movie. In the beginning the kids ask the hick store cashier what the rifle was for, and he replied that 'its for the niggers'. In the end of the film, 3 young Blacks (dressed in baggy clothes, one of them in a du-rag no less) go into the store....come to find out that the cashier was cleaning it for them to be used for hunting. THEN, he proceeds to give them all pounds and handshakes and joke around with them as if they're his homeboys. Okay, WHAT THE HELL WAS THE POINT OF THAT?!?!?!? How tasteless can one be, what were the filmmakers THINKING putting that in the movie? I as a Black man was of course offended by the initial 'Nigger' comment. It was a tasteless, pointless remark. My question to the filmmakers: what was the point of the ending with the Black kids? Was that to force me to forget about the initial racist comment made earlier? To smooth things over with Black viewers, by making a joke out of it? Well, I for one, did NOT find that pathetic attempt at humor funny in the least bit. The whole movie was a joke....a PATHETIC attempt at filmmaking that shouldn't be given the time of day. Peter Jackson really thought this film was that good? What film was HE looking at? ZERO * out of **** stars....if I could give it a lower rating I would. Please, fellow IMDb'ers, don't waste 1 1/2 hours of your precious life watching this abomination of a 'movie'.

I put my hand to my mouth in a dramatic gesture of embarrassment . Isla did the same . I giggled . What might Ian mean when he calls something a \\" bottom burp . \\"","completion":"When Ian refers to something as a \\"bottom burp,\\" he is using a humorous and informal term to describe the act of passing gas or flatulence. Flatulence is the expulsion of gas from the digestive system through the rectum. This natural bodily function is a result of the digestion and fermentation of food in the stomach and intestines, primarily caused by the presence and activity of bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract. The term \\"bottom burp\\" combines the words \\"bottom\\" (a colloquial term for the buttocks or rectum) and \\"burp\\" (the act of expelling gas from the stomach through the mouth). By using this playful and somewhat childlike phrase, Ian is making a comparison between the act of burping, which is generally more socially acceptable, and the less socially acceptable act of flatulence. This comparison serves to lighten the mood, adding a touch of humor and levity to an embarrassing or potentially uncomfortable situation. In the given context, when the grand finale rumble (or bottom burp) is mentioned, it is describing the sound and action of passing gas. The characters then put their hands to their mouths in dramatic gestures of embarrassment, acknowledging the unexpected and amusing occurrence. They both react in a similar manner, which helps to create a shared moment of amusement and connection. In conclusion, when Ian refers to something as a \\"bottom burp,\\" he is humorously describing the act of passing gas or flatulence. The choice of words allows him to draw a connection between burping and flatulence as similar bodily functions while also injecting humor and lightness into the situation, transforming an otherwise embarrassing moment into one of laughter and camaraderie."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The 1933 double eagle, a 20 gold piece with a mysterious history that involves a president, a king and a Secret Service sting operation, was auctioned Tuesday last night for a record price for a coin, 7.59 million, nearly double the previous record. The anonymous buyer, believed to be an individual collector who lives in the United States, made the winning bid in a fiercely contested nine-minute auction at Sotheby's in Manhattan. Eight bidders were joined by 500 coin collectors and dealers in an auction house audience seemingly devoid of celebrity bidders, while an additional 534 observers followed the bidding on eBay. As auction houses prepare for their fall seasons in an uncertain economy, the sale price \\"suggests that the marketplace for important items is enormously strong,\\" said David Redden, a vice chairman at Sotheby's, who was the auctioneer. \\"This is an astonishing new record for a coin,\\" he said. In an unprecedented move, the auction proceeds were split by the U.S. Mint and a London coin dealer, Stephen Fenton, who had won that right in court after having been arrested by Secret Service agents for trying to sell the coin in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan in 1996. Henrietta Holsman Fore, the director of the U.S. Mint, who witnessed the sale, said, \\"The monies we receive will go toward helping to pay down the debt and to fight the war on terrorism.\\" Fenton commented that the double eagle had been on \\"a long historic journey, with a very satisfying ending.\\" He added, \\"I am thrilled with the price.\\" The previous numismatic record holder was an 1804 U.S. silver dollar, which sold for 4.14 million in 1999. Sotheby's partner in the one-lot auction was Stack's Rare Coins, with which it shared the customary 15 percent commission. \\"I have never seen as much interest in the sale of any coin in my 30 years in the business,\\" said Lawrence R. Stack, the company's managing director. \\"This is the Mona Lisa of coins,\\" said Beth Deisher, editor of Coin World, the largest weekly coin publication in the United States, with a circulation of 85,000. \\"It is unique.

He understood the value of dedicating sufficient time to learn various teaching methodologies, assess different learning styles and develop strong communication skills. Robert, on the other hand, opted for a quicker certification program, feeling that practical experience in the classroom would be more valuable than extended training. Step 1: Understand the context and characters In this situation, we have two characters, Kenneth and Robert, with contrasting approaches to becoming certified teachers. Kenneth chooses to take his time, while Robert takes a faster route. Step 2: Expand on Kenneth's perspective Kenneth believes that a well-rounded education and comprehensive training are essential for an effective teacher. He wants to ensure that he has a strong understanding of various teaching methods, learning styles, and communication skills before stepping into the classroom. Step 3: Contrast with Robert's perspective Robert, on the other hand, thinks that practical experience in the classroom is more valuable than spending more time on certification and training. He prefers to learn as he goes and gain hands-on experience as a teacher. Step 4: Develop the story further As they pursued their respective paths, Kenneth and Robert had different experiences and outcomes. Kenneth found that the time he took to develop his skills in teaching and learning allowed him to create a more structured, inclusive, and supportive environment for his students. His lessons were engaging, adaptable, and encouraged critical thinking among his students. Robert's experience, while marked by occasional successes, also had its fair share of struggles. His lack of formal training and understanding of diverse learning styles sometimes resulted in difficulty managing his classroom and tailoring his teaching methods to individual student needs. Over time, however, Robert began to recognize the importance of professional development and sought out training opportunities to improve his practice. Step 5: Reflection on the characters' journeys In the end, both Kenneth and Robert became effective teachers, but their paths and the time taken to reach that point were vastly different. Kenneth's slow and steady approach allowed him to build a strong foundation, while Robert's faster path led him to encounter obstacles, which ultimately motivated him to seek further training and professional development.

Passage:Turkish Cypriot migration to Australia began in the late 1940s; they were the only Muslims acceptable under the White Australia Policy. Prior to 1940, the Australian Census recorded only three settlers from Cyprus that spoke Turkish as their primary language, although many Turkish Cypriot arrivals spoke Greek as their first language. A further 66 Turkish Cypriots arrived in Australia in the late 1940s, marking the beginning of a Turkish Cypriot immigration trend to Australia. By 1947-1956 there were 350 Turkish Cypriot settlers who were living in Australia. Between 1955-1960, the Turkish Cypriots felt vulnerable in Cyprus as they had cause for concern about the political future of the island when the Greek Cypriots attempted to overthrow the British government and unite Cyprus with Greece (known as \\"enosis\\"). After a failed attempt by the Greek Cypriots, the right-wing party, EOKA, reformed itself from 1963–1974 and launched a series of attacks. This resulted in the exodus of more Turkish Cypriots to Australia in fear for their lives. Early Turkish Cypriot immigrants to Australia found jobs working in factories, out in the fields, or building national infrastructure. Some Turkish Cypriots also became entrepreneurs and established their own businesses once they had saved enough money. By 1974, an exodus of more Turkish Cypriots to Australia occurred due to fears that the island would unite with Greece when the Greek military junta staged a coup d'état against the Cypriot President, with the help of EOKA B. Immigration to Australia has continued since as a result of an economic embargo which was launched against the Turkish Cypriots by the Greek Cypriot controlled Republic of Cyprus due to the establishment of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) which has remained internationally unrecognised except by Turkey.

Available options: (i). use a steel wool and water then keep wet as long as possible; (ii). use a steel wool and water then dry as much as possible;","completion":"(ii). use a steel wool and water then dry as much as possible Explanation: Using a steel wool and water to scrub the rust off the cast iron pan is effective in removing the rust. However, between the two options, the second one (ii) is the more sound solution based on naive physics reasoning. Option (i) suggests keeping the pan wet as long as possible, which makes it more prone to developing even more rust, as moisture and iron will react over time to form rust. On the other hand, option (ii) advises drying the pan as much as possible after using the steel wool, which helps prevent further rusting. It's important to dry the pan thoroughly to avoid moisture remaining on the surface and causing more corrosion. Additionally, it's recommended to apply a layer of oil to the pan's surface after cleaning and drying to further protect it from rusting."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Premise: \\"Napoleon named it Fort-de-France and that name was taken over for the town.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"Fort-de-France was named by Napoleon. \\" true?","completion":"Yes, based on the given premise, the hypothesis \\"Fort-de-France was named by Napoleon\\" is true. The premise states that Napoleon named the location \\"Fort-de-France\\" and the name was subsequently adopted for the town. This directly supports the hypothesis, as it establishes that Napoleon was the individual responsible for bestowing this name upon the town. In order to provide further historical context, Napoleon Bonaparte was a French military and political leader who rose to prominence in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. He was born in 1769 in Corsica and died in 1821 on the island of Saint Helena. Renowned for his military genius as well as his ambitious expansionist endeavors, Napoleon is considered one of the most significant figures in world history. During his reign, Napoleon was responsible for numerous territorial changes and reorganizations throughout Europe and its overseas territories. Fort-de-France, the capital of Martinique, a French overseas region in the Caribbean, was one such location impacted by his administrative decisions. By naming this fortification and effectively changing the town's name, Napoleon sought to establish and underscore the strategic importance of the location, while also further asserting French dominance in the area. In conclusion, the hypothesis that Fort-de-France was named by Napoleon is indeed true based on the provided premise. Given the historical context of Napoleon's reign and his actions in relation to territorial expansion, it is evident that he played a significant role in shaping the towns and geographic regions under French control during his lifetime, including the naming of Fort-de-France."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- Cuba will pardon more than 2,900 prisoners, the government said Friday, though U.S. subcontractor Alan Gross is not among those who will be freed. The decision to release the prisoners follows \\"numerous requests\\" from their family members and religious institutions, and is a humanitarian gesture, said Cuban President Raul Castro. Among those who might be freed are prisoners over the age of 60, along with those who are sick, female or young with no previous criminal record. With some exceptions, prisoners convicted of spying, terrorism, murder and drug trafficking will not be released. Those who will be freed have already served a \\"important\\" part of their sentences and exhibited good behavior, according to an official statement published on the state-run website Cubadebate. The jailed American, Gross, will not be among those pardoned, the Cuban Interests Section in Washington said. Gross was jailed in December 2009, when he was working as a subcontractor on a U.S. Agency for International Development project aimed at spreading democracy. Castro has accused him of importing satellite equipment to connect dissidents to the Internet, and this year Cuba's highest court upheld the 15-year sentence imposed on Gross for committing crimes against the security of the state. He has maintained his innocence and said he was trying to help connect the Jewish community to the Internet. Castro, speaking to the National Assembly, said that 86 prisoners from 25 countries would be among those released in coming days. He cited the upcoming visit of Pope Benedict XVI as one of the motivations behind the move, which he said showed the \\"generosity and strength of the revolution.\\" The pope has said he plans to visit Mexico and Cuba before Easter.

In this process, the candle wax (hydrocarbon compound) reacts with oxygen in the air to produce carbon dioxide, water (in the form of vapor), heat, and light. The formation of carbon dioxide and water from the wax and oxygen demonstrates that a new substance is being formed, and thus, this example shows a chemical reaction taking place. B). A shoelace being tied: Tying a shoelace is a physical change rather than a chemical reaction. In this process, the shoelace is not undergoing any change in its chemical composition. It only changes its shape or form. No new substance is being formed, and the process is entirely reversible. C). A pipe being cut in half: Cutting a pipe in half is another example of a physical change. In this process, the material of the pipe is not undergoing any change in its chemical composition. The pipe is merely being separated into two parts, with no new substance being formed. D). A block of ice melting: The melting of a block of ice is a physical change and not a chemical reaction. In this process, the ice (solid water) changes its state from solid to liquid, but the chemical composition remains the same (H2O). No new substance is formed during this process. In conclusion, option A (a candle burning) is the correct answer to this question, as it illustrates the formation of new substances (carbon dioxide and water) as a result of a chemical reaction (combustion)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

On a busy Friday morning in Manhattan, nine pedestrians suffered bullet or fragment wounds after police unleashed a hail of gunfire at a man wielding a .45 caliber pistol who had just killed a former co-worker. The officers unloaded 16 rounds in the shadow of the Empire State Building at a disgruntled former apparel designer, killing him after he engaged in a gunbattle with police, authorities said. Three passersby sustained direct gunshot wounds, while the remaining six were hit by fragments, according to New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly. All injuries were caused by police, he said Saturday. One officer shot nine rounds and another shot seven. Police identified the gunman as Jeffrey Johnson, 58, who was apparently laid off from his job as a designer of women's accessories at Hazan Import Co. last year. Johnson, who served in the U.S. Coast Guard in the mid-1970s, had two rounds left in his pistol. It holds eight, Kelly said. Police identified the slain co-worker as Steven Ercolino, 41, who had apparently filed a prior complaint against his assailant, claiming that he thought Johnson would eventually try to kill him. Both men had filed harassment complaints against each other in April 2011, Kelly added. Ercolino was listed as a vice president of sales at Hazan Import Corp., according to his LinkedIn profile. \\"It's not something that should happen to a loving person like that,\\" said his brother, Paul. \\"He's going to be so missed by everybody.

I don't know everything there is to know about bikes and bike repairs, and I absolutely HATE the pretentiousness of some of the people who work at other bike stores. It makes me not want to take my bike in when it needs repaired because I feel like an idiot. However, I tried these guys 3 or 4 years ago, and they have been amazing to me. There are no hangups about lack bike or part aptitude, and I don't feel guilty about walking in and saying, \\"It won't work\\" :) The guys here have always been super helpful, articulate and careful not to offend my (obviously) sensitive self. The repairs have always been relatively cheap and I have never felt ripped off. Furthermore, I just purchased a used road bike after moving back into the country, and I took it straight to them. They altered the brake lines a bit, pumped up the tires, gave me an oral diagnostic, and didn't charge me a dime.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the fifteen-year-old who auditioned for Lennon, impressing him with his playing? In March 1957, John Lennon, then aged sixteen, formed a skiffle group with several friends from Quarry Bank High School in Liverpool. They briefly called themselves the Blackjacks, before changing their name to the Quarrymen after discovering that a respected local group was already using the other name. Fifteen-year-old Paul McCartney joined them as a rhythm guitarist shortly after he and Lennon met that July. In February 1958, McCartney invited his friend George Harrison to watch the band. The fifteen-year-old auditioned for Lennon, impressing him with his playing, but Lennon initially thought Harrison was too young for the band. After a month of Harrison's persistence, during a second meeting (arranged by McCartney), he performed the lead guitar part of the instrumental song \\"Raunchy\\" on the upper deck of a Liverpool bus, and they enlisted him as their lead guitarist.By January 1959, Lennon's Quarry Bank friends had left the group, and he began his studies at the Liverpool College of Art. The three guitarists, billing themselves at least three times as Johnny and the Moondogs, were playing rock and roll whenever they could find a drummer. Lennon's art school friend Stuart Sutcliffe, who had just sold one of his paintings and was persuaded to purchase a bass guitar, joined in January 1960, and it was he who suggested changing the band's name to Beatals, as a tribute to Buddy Holly and the Crickets. They used this name until May, when they became the Silver Beetles, before undertaking a brief tour of Scotland as the backing group for pop singer and fellow Liverpudlian Johnny Gentle. By early July, they had refashioned themselves as the Silver Beatles, and by the middle of August shortened the name to The Beatles.Allan Williams, the Beatles' unofficial manager, arranged a residency for them in Hamburg, but lacking a full-time drummer they auditioned and hired Pete Best in mid-August 1960.

This potential biohazard poses a threat not only to the safety of our elected officials but also to public health in general. As a concerned citizen, I strongly urge you to take immediate action on this matter. To provide a background, the discovery of this letter containing billions of anthrax spores indicates a suspected case of bioterrorism. If not handled appropriately, these spores can cause serious harm to those exposed, including flu-like symptoms, respiratory failure, and even death. Furthermore, they can be released into the air and spread, affecting a larger population. I believe it is crucial to address this alarming situation by carrying out the following steps: 1. Investigate the source of the letter: An in-depth investigation should be launched to trace the origin of the letter and apprehend those responsible. This will send a strong message that such acts of terrorism will not be tolerated. 2. Ensure proper handling and disposal of hazardous materials: It is imperative that all personnel handling the letter were protected and followed appropriate safety protocols. Measures should be taken to confirm that the letter and its contents have been safely disposed of to eliminate further risk. 3. Strengthen security measures: To safeguard the well-being of our elected officials, it is advisable to review and reinforce security measures surrounding their correspondence, both physical and digital. 4. Raise awareness about bioterrorism: Increasing public awareness about the risks associated with bioterrorism should be prioritized. By recognizing the signs and understanding the implications of such threats, we can better equip ourselves to deal with these situations. 5. Collaborate with international counterparts: Sharing information and collaborating with foreign governments, law enforcement, and medical professionals can help deter future bioterrorist attacks and allow for a coordinated global response. To reiterate, the letter containing billions of anthrax spores sent to a senator is a disturbing event that warrants immediate attention. By taking these actions, we can ensure that our elected officials and the public remain safe from such biohazard threats. Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter.

It was an electrifying feeling that surged through my veins, making my skin tingle with excitement and anticipation. It felt as though there was a thousand tiny butterflies dancing inside my stomach, fluttering wildly on the strength of the powerful connection I had formed with him. And the way he looked at me—like I was the center of his universe—sent those butterflies into a frenzy. We walked down the hall, hand in hand, fingers intertwined, and it was a feeling of complete bliss to be so close to him, touching and connected. Our footsteps fell in sync, creating a calming rhythm as we made our way through the dimly lit corridor towards our room. The connection felt almost tangible, as though an invisible thread was weaving us closer together with each shared heartbeat, and the way he smiled at me from the corner of his eye was enough to make my knees weak. As we approached the door to our room, Trevor attempted to use the keycard. The magnetic strip refused to cooperate, and the tiny red light on the door flashed in rejection, causing him to curse under his breath. His frustration was palpable, a jolt of energy disrupting our calm. I couldn’t help but feel a twinge of amusement, understanding firsthand the impatience that came from wanting to cross the threshold into our private sanctuary, leaving the world behind. Sensing that the romantic moment was slipping through our fingers, I made my move. Sliding my arm around his waist, I nestled myself between Trevor and the stubborn door, our bodies pressed against each other as I gazed up at him. \\"Guess you'll just have to ravage me in this hallway,\\" I whispered, my voice sultry and teasing as I deliberately invoked the tantalizing image of our passionate embrace imposed against the backdrop of the empty corridor. The atmosphere changed instantly, the mounting frustration being replaced by renewed desire. Heat swirled between us, the intensity of our connection threatening to scald with every glance, every touch, every whispered word. And as Trevor looked into my eyes, the fire of our connection burned away all misgivings, leaving only the raw, towering passion that defined our relationship. As he pulled me closer, our lips met with the fury of a thousand suns, each kiss an offering to the gods of love and lust. The world around us seemed to fade away, until there was nothing left but Trevor and me, wrapped up in a whirlwind of passion so intense, it threatened to consume us whole. And as we kissed, I could feel those butterflies in my stomach taking flight once more, carried away on the winds of our love. The fluttering in my guts, that feeling of exhilaration and excitement, was as strong as it was the very first time I laid eyes on Trevor. It was a sign, I knew, of a relationship built on passion, trust, and devotion, and by holding him close, I pledged myself to this love for as long as the butterflies continued to dance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","completion":"1. Before storing brown sugar, first identify a cool, dry, and airtight container to prevent moisture from entering and causing the sugar to harden. A well-sealed plastic container or a glass jar with a tight lid work well for this purpose. This helps keep the brown sugar fresh and loose. 2. Place the brown sugar into the airtight container, gently pressing it down to eliminate any air pockets. To ensure the brown sugar remains soft, consider adding a small piece of bread or apple directly on top of the sugar before sealing the container. The moisture from the bread or apple will help maintain the sugar's softness overtime. 3. Securely seal the container to prevent any air exposure as it could cause the brown sugar to dry out and harden. Check that the lid is tight and well-fitted. 4. Store the container in a cool, dry location, such as a pantry or cupboard, away from direct sunlight and heat sources like the oven or stove. Maintaining a consistent temperature helps keep the brown sugar moist and soft. 5. Check the sugar's condition periodically to ensure it remains soft. If the bread or apple piece becomes dry, replace it with a fresh one as needed. Additionally, use your hands or a spoon to gently break up any clumps that may begin to form.

Step 1: Identify the situation - Jordan slept through their alarm and is now running late for school. Step 2: Understand common reactions to the situation - People typically feel stressed, anxious, or hurried when they are running late. This urgency could translate into hastily getting ready. Step 3: Consider the proposed answer - The proposed answer is that Jordan may feel \\"excited by having to get ready in a hurry.\\" Step 4: Compare the proposed answer with common reactions - Excitement, while not a typical reaction to running late, could be possible for some individuals. For instance, the adrenaline or rush related to trying to make up for lost time might make someone feel excited. Step 5: Determine validity of the answer - While the proposed answer is not the most common reaction, it still could be valid for some individuals depending on their personality and circumstances.

Her attempt fails and as she recovers, the story of her affair and her married life is played out in a mosaic of short and sporadic flashbacks.

Hester's new lover has awakened her sexuality, but the reckless, thrill-seeking Freddie can never give her the love and stability that her husband gave. Yet to return to a life without passion would be unbearable.

Whilst they are ridiculously expensive compared with most other nail polishes (AU39), they are still much more affordable than the AU1,000,000,000 a handbag costs (or so I estimate as I have never actually priced one). After seeing swatches of Peridot online, I knew that baby would one day be mine. The other two polishes in the collection - Quartz and Graphite - did not excite me the way Peridot did. That was until I read this review of Graphite on the Polish Police. Suddenly, Graphite was on my radar. It was stuck in my head like an ear worm; another baby, soon to be adopted. I argued with myself for about a month on whether to get these polishes or not. Could I really spend nearly 80 on nail polish. It did seem rather excessive to me. Then, Myers sent me a 10 voucher for my birthday and I got a 30 voucher for doing a survey so the decision was made. For 38 of my own money (less than the cost of two OPI's!) I became the proud owner of Peridot and Graphite. Here is my review of Graphite. Graphite is the most stunningly intriguing nail polish I have ever owned. In the bottle it looks a little bit dull and boring - grey and bland. But on the nail it is completely different. In some lights it is silvery, others a more gun metal grey, and in others it has almost a goldish tone to it. It is super sparkly, yet is not a glitter polish - though in saying that it appears more glitter than shimmer. It is quite opaque. Two coats and you can't see the nail line.

Needs to file court papers; b). live their new identity; c). Hide Austin;","completion":"Before Skylar can have Austin's name changed to help protect him, there are multiple steps Skylar would need to take, primarily considering option (a) - Needs to file court papers. While options (b) and (c) are also important aspects of protecting Austin, they follow the legal name change process. Below is a detailed breakdown of the steps that Skylar should follow: Step 1: Research Name Change Laws and Requirements Skylar should begin by researching the laws and requirements for a name change in their jurisdiction. Each state or country has its specific guidelines and protocols for legally changing a name. This step would involve understanding which court handles name changes and the specific documentation necessary for the process. Step 2: Obtain Necessary Forms Skylar would need to obtain the necessary legal forms required for changing Austin's name. These forms may be available at the local courthouse or can be downloaded from the court's website. Typically, forms required may include a petition for a name change, consent forms (if Austin is a minor), and an order granting the name change. Step 3: Complete the Required Forms Skylar must accurately complete the name change forms. They should provide the necessary information, such as Austin's current full name, date of birth, current address, the reason for the name change, and the desired new name. If Austin is a minor, Skylar would need to sign the forms and obtain consent from Austin's other legal parent or guardian, if applicable. Step 4: File the Petition Once the forms are completed, Skylar should file the petition for a name change with the appropriate court. There will likely be a filing fee associated with this step, which would need to be paid when submitting the paperwork. Skylar should check with the courthouse regarding the accepted methods of payment. Step 5: Public Notice In many jurisdictions, Skylar would need to publish a notice of the name change in a local newspaper for a specific number of weeks. This requirement serves as a method to inform the public of the name change request and allows for objections from anyone who may have a legitimate reason for objecting. Step 6: Attend Court Hearing (if necessary) Depending on the specific laws in Skylar's jurisdiction, they may need to attend a court hearing to finalize the name change process. If a hearing is required, Skylar should attend and present any supporting documents or witnesses, if applicable. In some cases, this step may require attendance from Austin as well. Step 7: Obtain a Certified Copy of the Court Order Once the judge approves the name change, Skylar should obtain a certified copy of the court order granting the name change. This document serves as legal proof of Austin's new name. After completing the name change process in court, Skylar should then proceed to option (b) - live their new identity. They should take steps to update Austin's official identification documents (Social Security card, passport, driver's license, school records, etc.) with the new name. Additionally, they should inform friends, neighbors, employers, and others as needed about the change. This may help protect Austin further by ensuring that individuals who know Austin by his new name are less likely to inadvertently reveal his previous name. Finally, Skylar may also consider option (c) - Hide Austin, which would involve taking measures to physically protect him from any potential threats. This could include moving to a new location, fortifying home security, or even enrolling Austin in a new school. Every precaution should be taken to ensure Austin's safety while living under his new identity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

I usually don't write negative reviews, but I couldn't let it slide this time. Upon arrival, we had to wait for more than 20 minutes to be seated, even though we had a reservation. The staff didn't seem concerned or apologetic about the delay. Once seated, the environment was incredibly noisy, and it was difficult to have a conversation with my dining companion. The tables were too close together, and I couldn't help but notice the stained tablecloth and dirty silverware as we sat down. The food quality was subpar. My entreé arrived lukewarm, and the presentation was lackluster. The dish claimed to be \\"expertly prepared,\\" but the flavors were bland and unremarkable. My companion's entreé was equally underwhelming, served with a side of soggy vegetables that seemed like they'd been sitting out for quite some time. The waitstaff, unfortunately, didn't improve our experience. Our server was inattentive and getting any question answered felt like an inconvenience to them. It took ages to receive our bill, and our server never checked in to see how we were enjoying our meal or if anything needed to be corrected. I wish I could say there was a saving grace, but I'm hard-pressed to find one in this instance.

Paragraph: Life for the partners of Cates, Katalinic & Lund holds little of the glamour one might expect from a career in law. Instead of lunches at Lut��ce, they caucus at the Palace Diner in Queens. Wooing clients means passing out fliers on street corners, not securing box seats at Madison Square Garden. To make ends meet, one partner stacks pipe and cleans the yard at a plumbing warehouse. Another handles urine samples in a hospital lab. A sign of failure, of a feeble economy, perhaps? Hardly. They are heeding the call of a growing pool of law schools, which are for the first time pointing graduates in a new direction and teaching them how to get there. Forget the lure of large firms, the security of a government post. Here is how to grapple \\"in the service of justice,\\" as many of the schools put it, instead. Convinced that corporate largess and government programs barely dent the nation's legal needs, the law schools are urging graduates to buck tradition, pass up big salaries and ignore mushrooming student debt to join tiny neighborhood practices or simply start their own, all with an eye toward charging no more than their clients can afford. This is not pro bono legal work; it is \\"low bono,\\" a term the schools coined to define the atypical kind of law career they are training students for. While its practitioners do charge for their services, they are also dead set on turning no one away - or at least as few as possible. \\"When you go into this kind of social justice law, it's really brutal and you're almost guaranteed to struggle for a couple of years before there's a light at the end of the tunnel,\\" said Fred Rooney, director of the Community Legal Resource Network at City University of New York School of Law, from which the lawyers of the newly formed Cates, Katalinic & Lund graduated last May. \\"But if our graduates don't do it, the millions of people who cannot access justice in this country will continue to soar.\\" The movement, primly called the consortium, started four years ago by CUNY, Northeastern University, the University of Maryland and St. Mary's Law School in Texas.

Working in the garden at midnight tended to throw her timing off, so she didn't care much about my bedtime. Dad was a Railway Express agent and Mom was his clerk. That left me in a mess. I usually managed to find some trouble to get into. Once I had a little Are going in the dirt basement of a hotel. I had tried to light a barrel of paint but couldn't really get a good fire going. The smoke got pretty bad, though, and when 1 made my exit, a crowd and the police were there to greet me. The policemen took my matches and drove me Mom and Dad were occupied in the garden and Dad told the police to keep me, and they did! I had a tour of the prison before Mom rescued me. 1 hadn't turned 5 yet. As I entered kindergarten, the serious cold began to set in.

No. b). Yes. Answer:","completion":"a). No. The given statement \\"The diet of the omnivorous raccoon, which is usually nocturnal , consists of about 40% invertebrates , 33% plant foods, and 27% vertebrates\\" does not answer the question about the number of babies in a typical raccoon litter. Instead, it provides information about the raccoon's diet and feeding habits. To answer the original question, we need to focus on raccoon reproductive habits and provide information regarding the number of offspring in a raccoon litter. A more appropriate answer for this question would be: Raccoons typically breed once per year, usually between January and March, with a gestation period of about 63 to 65 days. A typical raccoon litter consists of 2 to 5 kits, also known as cubs or baby raccoons. However, the litter size can vary depending on factors such as the mother raccoon's age, health, and habitat conditions. First-time mothers tend to have smaller litters, while older and more experienced mothers can have larger litters. In ideal conditions, raccoon litters have been known to reach up to 7 kits. The number of babies in a raccoon litter can also be influenced by the availability of food and shelter, as well as competition for resources with other raccoons in the area. In regions with abundant resources, raccoons may have larger litters, while those in more challenging environments may produce fewer offspring. It is important to note that raccoon populations can fluctuate depending on environmental factors, which can also impact the overall population size and litter numbers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hint: Farsightedness, or hyperopia, is the condition in which distant objects are seen clearly, but nearby objects appear blurry. It occurs when the eyeball is shorter than normal (see Figure below ). This causes images to be focused in a spot that would fall behind the retina (if light could pass through the retina).

Image copyright Getty Images It is time to reconsider the widespread advice that people should always complete an entire course of antibiotics, experts in the BMJ say. They argue there is not enough evidence to back the idea that stopping pills early encourages antibiotic resistance. Instead, they suggest, more studies need to be done to see if stopping once feeling better can help cut antibiotic use. But GPs urge people not to change their behaviour in the face of one study. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, leader of the Royal College of General Practitioners, said an improvement in symptoms did not necessarily mean the infection had been completely eradicated. \\"It's important that patients have clear messages, and the mantra to always take the full course of antibiotics is well known - changing this will simply confuse people.\\" Analysis: Antibiotic apocalypse World's most threatening superbugs ranked in new list Oral sex spreading unstoppable bacteria 'Short and tailored' The opinion piece, by a team of researchers from across England, argues that reducing the use of antibiotics is essential to help combat the growing problem of antibiotic resistance. Prof Martin Llewelyn, from the Brighton and Sussex Medical School, together with colleagues, argues that using antibiotics for longer than necessary can increase the risk of resistance. He suggests traditional long prescriptions for antibiotics were based on the outdated idea that resistance to an antibiotic could develop when a drug was not taken for a lengthy time and an infection was undertreated. Instead, he says, there is now growing evidence that short courses of antibiotics - lasting three to five days, for example - work just as well to treat many bugs. He accepts there are a few exceptions - for example, giving just one type of antibiotic for TB infections - which is known to lead to rapid resistance. But the team says it is important to move away from blanket prescriptions and, with more research, give antibiotic prescriptions that are tailored to each infection and each person. The study acknowledges that hospitals are increasingly reviewing the need for antibiotics from day to day and that there is a growing trend towards shorter courses of drugs. But it questions whether advice such as stopping once feeling better would be beneficial - particularly when patients do not get the opportunity to be reviewed in the hospital every day. They accept this idea would need more research. Image copyright Getty Images Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, leader of the Royal College of General Practitioners, says while it is important to take new evidence into account, she \\"cannot advocate widespread behaviour change on the results of just one study\\". She says recommended courses of antibiotics are \\"not random\\" but tailored to individual conditions and in many cases courses are quite short. And she says: \\"We are concerned about the concept of patients stopping taking their medication mid-way through a course once they 'feel better', because improvement in symptoms does not necessarily mean the infection has been completely eradicated. Meanwhile, Kieran Hand, spokesman for the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, said: \\"This opinion article from respected NHS infection experts is a welcome opening of the debate in the UK on the relationship between the length of a course of antibiotics, efficacy and resistance. \\"As researchers have pointed out, further research is needed before the 'Finish the course' mantra for antibiotics is changed and any alternative message, such as, 'Stop when you feel better,' can be confidently advocated. \\"The ideal future scenario would be that the right length of treatment for a specific infection for patients is identified from clinical trials and the exact quantity prescribed and dispensed.\\" Public Health England says patients should continue to follow their health professional's advice about using antibiotics. ||||| If there were a battle hymn against antibiotic resistance, it would have one common refrain: Every inappropriate prescription or insufficient dose strengthens the enemy. It may kill weak bacteria but it won’t eliminate stronger, drug-resistant ones that can move in and multiply. Eventually those robust microbes can outsmart available drugs, and even pass on survival instructions to other bacterial strains.That’s why most doctors—along with the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—urge patients to always complete prescribed drug courses, even after they feel better. Taking too small a dose or stopping early, they reason, could fuel surges in drug resistance. But a group of U.K. infectious disease experts is urging physicians and public health experts to change their tune. In a commentary published Wednesday in the British Medical Journal, they wrote, “The ‘complete the course’ message has persisted despite not being supported by evidence and previous arguments that it should be replaced. ... Nevertheless, there is evidence that, in many situations, stopping antibiotics sooner is a safe and effective way to reduce antibiotic overuse.” The authors—Martin Llewelyn, a professor of infectious diseases at Brighton and Sussex Medical School, and nine British colleagues—point to recent studies that have shown shorter courses of certain drug classes such as quinolones are as effective as the longer courses that have been recommended in the past. Yet the authors are not just calling for more studies that might lead to shorter standard treatment courses. They are saying that in the short-term the “always complete the course” message should be dumped. “Research is needed to determine the most appropriate simple alternative messages, such as stop when you feel better,” they wrote. They assert that there is also no evidence strong enough to support many of the current guidelines, a situation that forces physicians to rely on assumptions or historical practice to decide antibiotic treatment. Drug resistance experts applauded the suggestions to reduce unnecessary medication use and to improve standard treatment protocols when possible. But they were skeptical about changing the “finish your pills” messaging or significantly altering outpatient care. “My thought is that this is a radical stance—although in some ways correct,” says Lance Price, a microbiologist and director of the Antibiotic Resistance Action Center at The George Washington University. “This [commentary] is a really good thought piece, but I think they go too far in saying we need to stop this messaging. We know antibiotics are not smart bombs or snipers—they do not target only one desired body part like the bladder, as we would like. But to say, ‘Let’s pull the plug on this messaging without providing a reasonable, actionable countermessage’ is totally irresponsible.” Lauri Hicks, director of the Office of Antibiotic Stewardship at the CDC, says she agrees that there are many unanswered questions about appropriate drug treatment courses. But she cautions that patients should not stop taking their prescribed antibiotics on their own. “I recommend that if a patient is feeling better while taking a course of antibiotics, that the patient or the patient’s family should consult a physician to see if those antibiotics can be safely stopped,” she says. “I think it really needs to be a decision made with input from the provider. In certain circumstances taking the full course is important, and it may not be as important for some other, milder infections.” Bacteria have developed multiple tactics to boost their resistance, depending on the infection and antibiotic involved. Some strains have learned how to expel an antibiotic before it can do any damage. Others can effectively neutralize an antibiotic by changing it in a way that makes it harmless to them. In some cases bacteria have mutated to change their outer structures so an antibiotic cannot recognize them or attach to them—rendering the drug useless. Longer courses of antibiotics put selective pressure on bacteria in the body, which can help the microbes’ resistance grow. As a result, infectious disease experts currently try to find a balance between making sure drugs are effective at knocking out harmful bacteria while keeping the treatment duration to the bare minimum required to stamp out an infection. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) has changed some of its guidelines for certain medications, based on recent studies that show shorter courses suffice. But some studies indicate shortening treatment courses would leave patients vulnerable to a resurgence of infection or, in some cases, potentially result in selective growth of resistance organisms. Existing recommendations are largely based on clinical trials, says Helen Boucher, a professor of medicine and infectious diseases at Tufts Medical Center and a spokesperson for the IDSA. “I think the spirit of this paper is very much in line with what IDSA advocates for,” Boucher says. “As part of the strategy to combat the antibiotic resistance crisis, we should think about strategies to use less drugs and use drugs for shorter duration.” The incentive to study these shorter courses needs to come from funders like the National Institutes of Health, she adds. Llewelyn and his co-authors suggest some specific steps for the path forward. They wrote that a common practice in hospitals—a daily review of a patient’s continued need for antibiotics—must become more common in primary care as well, because that is where some 85 percent of prescriptions are written. (Many experts, including Hicks, say this recommendation is probably unrealistic due to the need to pay for follow-up visits and limitations on both doctors’ and patients’ time in an outpatient setting.) The authors also call for fundamental changes in public health and drug treatment messaging: “Public education about antibiotics should highlight the fact that antibiotic resistance is primarily the result of antibiotic overuse and is not prevented by completing a course,” they wrote. Such big changes in messaging are not yet ready for prime time, Price says. No current guidelines suggest stopping drug treatment partway through a recommended treatment course. For example, the CDC has often said in its public materials and reports, “Take antibiotics exactly as the doctor prescribes. Do not skip doses. Complete the prescribed course of treatment, even when you start feeling better.” But the CDC and IDSA say they are continually reviewing the literature and support guidelines based on new information. Changing standard prescribing practices will likely be challenging, the commentary’s authors acknowledge, pointing to the “finish your drugs” education in U.K. schools. “The idea is deeply embedded, and both doctors and patients currently regard failure to complete a course of antibiotics as irresponsible behavior,” they wrote. Even designing experiments to test reducing antibiotic courses remains difficult, they added, because participants are often invited to consent to receive shortened antibiotic treatment on the basis that this could reduce the risk of antibiotic resistance—yet they are “taught from school that it increases this risk.” ||||| Experts suggest patients should stop taking the drugs when they feel better rather than completing their prescription Telling patients to stop taking antibiotics when they feel better may be preferable to instructing them to finish the course, according to a group of experts who argue that the rule long embedded in the minds of doctors and the public is wrong and should be overturned. Patients have traditionally been told that they must complete courses of antibiotics, the theory being that taking too few tablets will allow the bacteria causing their disease to mutate and become resistant to the drug. But Martin Llewelyn, a professor in infectious diseases at Brighton and Sussex medical school, and colleagues claim that this is not the case. In an analysis in the British Medical Journal, the experts say “the idea that stopping antibiotic treatment early encourages antibiotic resistance is not supported by evidence, while taking antibiotics for longer than necessary increases the risk of resistance”. Without action on antibiotics, medicine will return to the dark ages | Ed Whiting Read more There are some diseases where the bug can become resistant if the drugs are not taken for long enough. The most obvious example is tuberculosis, they say. But most of the bacteria that cause people to become ill are found on everybody’s hands in the community, causing no harm, such as E coli and Staphylococcus aureus. People fall ill only when the bug gets into the bloodstream or the gut. The longer such bacteria are exposed to antibiotics, the more likely it is that resistance will develop. The experts say there has been too little research into the ideal length of a course of antibiotics, which also varies from one individual to the next, depending in part on what antibiotics they have taken in the past. In hospital, patients can be tested to work out when to stop the drugs. “Outside hospital, where repeated testing may not be feasible, patients might be best advised to stop treatment when they feel better,” they say. That, they add, is in direct contravention of World Health Organisation advice. Other experts in infectious diseases backed the group. “I have always thought it to be illogical to say that stopping antibiotic treatment early promotes the emergence of drug-resistant organisms,” said Peter Openshaw, president of the British Society for Immunology. “This brief but authoritative review supports the idea that antibiotics may be used more sparingly, pointing out that the evidence for a long duration of therapy is, at best, tenuous. Far from being irresponsible, shortening the duration of a course of antibiotics might make antibiotic resistance less likely.” Alison Holmes, a professor of infectious diseases at Imperial College London, said a great British authority, Prof Harold Lambert, had made the same point in a Lancet article entitled “Don’t keep taking the tablets” as early as 1999. “It remains astonishing that apart from some specific infections and conditions, we still do not know more about the optimum duration of courses or indeed doses in many conditions, yet this dogma has been pervasive and persistent.” Jodi Lindsay, a professor of microbial pathogenesis at St George’s, University of London, said it was sensible advice. “The evidence for ‘completing the course’ is poor, and the length of the course of antibiotics has been estimated based on a fear of under-treating rather than any studies,” she said. “The evidence for shorter courses of antibiotics being equal to longer courses, in terms of cure or outcome, is generally good, although more studies would help and there are a few exceptions when longer courses are better – for example, TB.” But the Royal College of GPs expressed concerns. “Recommended courses of antibiotics are not random,” said its chair, Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard. “They are tailored to individual conditions and in many cases, courses are quite short – for urinary tract infections, for example, three days is often enough to cure the infection. “We are concerned about the concept of patients stopping taking their medication midway through a course once they ‘feel better’, because improvement in symptoms does not necessarily mean the infection has been completely eradicated. It’s important that patients have clear messages and the mantra to always take the full course of antibiotics is well known. Changing this will simply confuse people.” England’s chief medical officer, Prof Dame Sally Davies, said: “The message to the public remains the same: people should always follow the advice of healthcare professionals. To update policies, we need further research to inform them. “[The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence] is currently developing guidance for managing common infections, which will look at all available evidence on appropriate prescribing of antibiotics. “The Department of Health will continue to review the evidence on prescribing and drug-resistant infections, as we aim to continue the great progress we have made at home and abroad on this issue.” ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"There is a growing consensus in the medical field that it may be time to reconsider the widely accepted advice that people should always complete a full course of antibiotics, according to an opinion piece in the British Medical Journal.

Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context? A: happy B: delighted C: miserable A:","completion":"According to the context provided, Remy had a headache and, as a result, he did not think of anything. It can be inferred that Remy would not be feeling well due to his headache. Out of the given options, the one that best describes a person who is not feeling well is: C: miserable After having a headache, a person typically feels discomfort, pain, and possibly even disoriented. This can cause them to be in a bad mood or feel generally unwell. In this situation, Remy would likely feel miserable rather than happy or delighted, as the presence of a headache would hinder him from enjoying his day or engaging in various activities. The pain and discomfort related to a headache can significantly affect one's emotional state, leading to the feeling of misery. In conclusion, considering the question and evaluating the context: \\"How would Remy feel afterwards?\\" The best answer is: C: miserable This answer accurately captures the emotions and physical pain that Remy would likely experience due to his headache, which would prevent him from being in a positive emotional state like happy (A) or delighted (B)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Write highlights for this article: PUBLISHED:. 05:07 EST, 26 April 2012. |. UPDATED:. 05:24 EST, 26 April 2012. Neglected: Molly Darby, seen shortly before her death in 2007, had been a resident at the Beeches home for just a few weeks. A coroner has launched a scathing attack on a care home after an emaciated pensioner was admitted to hospital weighing less than five-and-a-half stone. Just five weeks before, 'sprightly' 94-year-old Molly Darby had walked into a privately-run care home in good physical health. But she deteriorated to such an extent at the Beeches Residential Care Home, in Wath-on-Dearne, South Yorkshire, that she was taken out on a stretcher and died shortly after. When she was admitted to hospital as an emergency case her family claimed she resembled a 'concentration camp victim'. Staff nurses were shocked to find the. widowed mother-of-six had a chest infection, pneumonia, pressure sores,. septicaemia and ear and urinary infections. Staff thought she would not. make it through the night but she survived for another two and a half. weeks. Rotherham coroner. Nicola Mundy yesterday said: 'I find it very alarming that such a. vulnerable person who relied on professionals for her care and support. was presented to hospital in the way she was. 'The. vulnerable in our society must be properly cared for on all levels and. their dignity protected. I think that Mrs Darby was not afforded the. care and dignity she deserved on this occasion.' Nurse. Julie Norton who received Mrs Darby on a general medical ward at. Barnsley District Hospital said: 'It was quite upsetting. She was. really, really frail. There were some issues we were really concerned. about. 'When I was changing her bedding with another nurse we were all quite upset and distressed. Her right ear was impacted with ear wax and she had a pressure sore, her hair was thin and wispy and badly stuck to her face and neck and her eyes were completely shut. It took quite a lot of bathing with water to open them.' When old people’s matron Karen Sharpe saw Mrs Darby she immediately contacted social services. Endocrine specialist Dr Elizabeth Uchegbu, who examined Mrs Darby, reported: 'She appeared neglected and unkempt, there was a discharge from both eyes, a smell of urine and she was distressed. She was covered in faeces when she first arrived.' Deterioration: Jim Darby, 72, at his mother's bedside in 2007. The retired miner said Mrs Darby was 'sprightly' when she entered the home. The doctor wrote later: 'I got the impression she was neglected. She was weak and thin and it could not be explained.' Tissue viability nurse Tracy Green, who carried out an investigation after Mrs Darby’s death, said there were no notes about her pressure sores yet Molly was at 'high risk' of skin damage. 'I believe there had been neglect by omission,' she said. 'This is in the absence of any proof that there was any intervention.' The Rotherham hearing was told Mrs Darby had a lower than normal body mass index and had been assessed at risk of malnutrition four months before she went into the home. Her son Jim Darby, 72, a retired miner, told the inquest his mother was 'sprightly' when she was at home in West Melton, near Rotherham. 'Her carers used to say my mum could get up the stairs better than they could,' he said. But the great-grandmother developed dementia and needed 24-hour care so her family decided to put her in the Beeches. She went into the home on July 6, 2007. Failings: An inquiry found the widowed mother of six suffered unintentional abuse through 'neglect by omission' Mr Darby said: 'They kept saying they were feeding her and I had no reason not to believe it but it turned out it was wrong. The nurse at the hospital said she had never seen anybody come into hospital from a care home in such a bad state.' The former care home manager Julie Morgan said in a statement that staff helped Mrs Darby with her personal hygiene and toileting, but her diet was poor and she would often refuse to eat. Care assistant Michelle Burkinshaw told the inquest the elderly patient had mobility problems and she was refusing food and fluids. She regularly washed her, bathed her eyes and put cream on her sores. Pathologist Dr Caroline Quincy said Mrs Darby died on August 29, 2007, from broncho-pneumonia contributed to by coronary artery atheroma. She said her reduced mobility could have played a part in increasing the risk of pneumonia and there was also evidence of malnourishment. The 44-bed Beeches was run by the Winnie Care Group at the time of Mrs Darby's death but last year it was sold to new owners MHA. An inquiry by Rotherham Council’s social services department found the previous owners negligent by 'omission of care' for Mrs Darby in February, 2008. Moira Ockenden, area manager of the Beeches at the time, denied Mrs Darby was emaciated. In a letter to the family read at the inquest she said: 'The references to a concentration camp victim are unjustified.' She said staff claimed to wash or bathe Mrs Darby on a daily basis and they regularly brushed her hair. The widow had a poor appetite and would refuse food, she said. She admitted the old woman had sores on her heels, right hip and lower spine when admitted to hospital and that she should have been referred to a dietician. Sam Newton, Rotherham Council’s safeguarding service manager said an inquiry found Mrs Darby had suffered abuse through 'neglect by omission' but it was not intentional. 'It was based on poor recording, little or no evidence in respect of the care she was receiving, there were no weight charts, fluid or diet recordings and there was no evidence of professional visits.' Tom Parramore, service manager for the current owners of the Beeches said all the staff were now fully trained and there was regular auditing of residents’ hygiene, nutrition and medication needs. Cause for concern: The Beeches Residential Care Home, in Wath-on-Dearne, South Yorkshire, has been taken over since Mrs Darby's death, but former operator Winnie Care still runs other homes. Recording a narrative verdict the coroner said: 'Her basic care and medical requirements were not satisfactorily met and her decreased mobility during her time at the Beeches increased her risk of developing a chest infection.' Ms Mundy went on: 'Her nutritional status compromised her ability to cope with the effects of the chest infection, the latter of which led to her death.' After the hearing, Mrs Darby's granddaughter Pearl Green, 56, said: 'The coroner confirmed everything we knew as a family. Neglect did contribute to her death. The care she was provided with in that place was absolutely disgusting. It was inhuman.' Mrs Darby’s son Ray, 68, said: 'Her life was shortened by this. There was a total lack of care. She hardly saw a doctor in 40 years before she went into that home. She did all her own shopping and was very active for her age.' The coroner is also writing to Winnie Care, which still operates other care homes, asking them if they have reviewed all their procedures, documentation and training following Mrs Darby's death.","completion":"A coroner has condemned Beeches Residential Care Home after a frail 94-year-old woman, Molly Darby, was admitted to hospital weighing less than five-and-a-half stone, and passed away shortly thereafter.

Summarize this article: Tunnel boring machines, called TBMs for short or “moles,” feature circular plates on the front called shields. Disc-shaped cutters on the shield tear through rock and dirt, which passes through openings in the shield onto a conveyor belt inside the TBM that deposit it behind the machine. The types of TBM shields vary according to whether the mole is to dig into soft, wet ground or hard rock. Shield diameters range from Aker Wirth’s 26.3-foot (8.03 m) shield on its TBM used for Switzerland’s Linth-Limmern power stations to Hitachi Zosen’s “Big Bertha,” with its diameter of 57.5 feet (17.5 m). Moles designed to dig tunnels below the water table also feature chambers at the front to pressurize the ground being dug through. For large jobs, multiple TBMs may be called for. The Channel Tunnel required 11. For a surface level tunnel, this is no problem. If the tunnel is to be bored deep underground, an access shaft, usually circular, is drilled and lined with concrete. The TBM is lowered into it, and the tunnel is excavated from that point. For long tunnels, multiple access shafts are drilled. When the tunnel is finished, the access shafts may become ventilation shafts and/or emergency exits. If they are not so employed, they are left in place for the life of the tunnel. Segments of pre-cast concrete are erected behind the TBM to form a ring at pre-determined intervals. The sprayed concrete, or shotcrete, coats and stabilizes the tunnel walls. The shotcrete may include steel or polypropylene fibers to strengthen it, much the way steel rebar is used to strengthen cast concrete. The shotcrete also contains an accelerant to help it stick to the tunnel walls and dry quickly.","completion":"Tunnel Boring Machines (TBMs), often referred to as 'moles,' are advanced machines used for creating tunnels in various ground types. They are equipped with circular shields at the front that include disc-shaped cutters for tearing through rock and dirt. The rock and dirt are then moved through openings in the shield onto a conveyor belt inside the TBM, which carries it to the back of the machine. The types of shields used on a TBM differ depending on whether the machine is intended to dig through soft, wet ground or hard rock. The shields come in various diameters, from Aker Wirth's 26.3 ft (8.03 m) shield for its TBM used in the Linth-Limmern power stations in Switzerland, to Hitachi Zosen’s ‘Big Bertha,’ which has a diameter of massive 57.5 feet (17.5 m). Boring machines designed to dig tunnels below the water table have chambers at the front to pressurize the ground being excavated. For large-scale tunnelling projects, multiple TBMs might be required; for example, the Channel Tunnel project required 11 TBMs. In projects requiring deep, sub-surface tunnelling, an access shaft, typically circular, is drilled and lined with concrete. The TBM is then lowered into this shaft and the tunnel excavation begins from this point. For especially long tunnels, several access shafts will be drilled. After the part of the tunnel linked to a particular shaft is complete, these shafts can be converted into ventilation shafts, emergency exits, or simply left in place if not needed. The tunneling process also includes the construction of a solid tunnel structure. As the TBM moves forward, segments of precast concrete are erected at specific intervals to form a ring. This ring is then coated and stabilized with a type of sprayed concrete known as shotcrete. The shotcrete not only helps to reinforce the structure of the tunnel, but also contains an accelerant to enable it to adhere to the tunnel walls and dry quickly. It may include steel or polypropylene fibers to enhance its strength in a similar manner to how steel rebar is used to strengthen cast concrete. Thus, through the integrated use of cutting-edge machinery, construction techniques, and materials, TBMs enable the efficient and effective construction of tunnels."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Allow me to present a detailed answer for you: The capital of Brazil, Brasilia, was created to promote the development and growth of the country's interior. Before the construction of Brasilia, Rio de Janeiro served as the capital of Brazil. However, the government saw the need for a more geographically centralized capital for better administration and to reduce the population's concentration on coastal cities. The idea of a new capital was already present in Brazil's constitution since 1891, but the actual construction began in the late 1950s. To create Brasilia, Brazilian President Juscelino Kubitschek appointed urban planner Lucio Costa and architect Oscar Niemeyer to design and supervise the construction of a new city. The construction took about four years and was inaugurated on April 21, 1960. The layout of the city was designed in the shape of an airplane, with distinct zones for distinct purposes, such as residential, government, and commercial sectors. The futuristic architectural design of the city was intended to represent progress and the potential for Brazil to become a modern, industrialized nation. While Brasilia became the country's political capital, it ranks sixth in terms of metropolitan population size. Nevertheless, Brasilia has attracted millions of residents since its creation and serves as a symbol of the rapid development and modernization in Brazil."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Fact: animals learn some behaviors from watching their parents Question: What shows that animals learn behaviors by watching their parents? What's the answer? Choose from: (1). kittens groom their faces because their mother licked their faces. (2). dogs bark because their parents barked at them. (3). babies cry because overtired parents cry. (4). kittens climb trees because they watch squirrels do it.","completion":"The answer is (1). Kittens groom their faces because their mother licked their faces. To provide a detailed explanation, it is essential to understand that animals, like humans, rely on various methods of learning, one of which is observational learning. Observational learning occurs when an animal learns a behavior by watching and imitating the actions of another animal, usually a parent or an older member of the same species. In the case of kittens, they learn several behaviors from their mothers. Mother cats are responsible for teaching their kittens essential life skills that allow them to grow into healthy and independent adult cats. One notable behavior that kittens learn from their mothers is grooming, specifically the grooming of their faces. Mother cats typically start grooming their kittens shortly after birth, and this process serves several purposes. Firstly, it helps to clean the kittens, removing any birthing fluids or other debris. This grooming practice also encourages blood circulation and serves as a bonding experience between mother and kitten. In response to their mother's actions, kittens learn to groom themselves by licking their paws and then using the damp paw to clean their faces. This learned grooming behavior helps kittens stay clean and healthy as they grow up. The other options listed do not accurately depict how animals learn behavior from their parents: (2). Dogs bark because their parents barked at them - While dogs might learn specific barks or vocalizations by listening to their parents or other dogs, barking is generally a natural response for dogs to communicate various emotions, including agitation, excitement, or fear, among others. Genetic factors and individual personality traits also play a role in dogs' barking behaviors. (3). Babies cry because overtired parents cry - Babies cry primarily to communicate needs such as hunger, discomfort, or tiredness. While parents may model behaviors to cope with stress or fatigue, a baby's crying is not directly caused by a parent crying. Emotional distress in parents may, however, contribute to an unsettled environment where the baby's cries are not quickly attended to or resolved. (4). Kittens climb trees because they watch squirrels do it - While it's possible that kittens might observe squirrels climbing trees, their innate climbing abilities stem from their genetic predisposition as climbers. Cats, in general, have evolved as skilled tree-climbers, equipped with sharp claws and powerful hindquarters that enable them to scale various surfaces. Kittens might observe their mothers or other adult cats climbing trees and this could aid their interest and learning in such activities, but their primary influence comes from their natural instincts, not from watching different species like squirrels."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

With its purchase of Nokia's mobile phone business, Microsoft has brought a longtime partner into the fold to help fight a battle that has been tough for both companies. Microsoft, which was late to the smartphone game with its Windows mobile operating system, badly trails Android and Apple's iOS. And while Nokia is still a force selling feature phones worldwide, it's barely made a dent in the smartphone market. But if the Finnish company is struggling today, it can still take pride in its history at the forefront of the mobile movement. Here are five ways the once-dominant phonemaker has helped shape the world of mobile electronics as we know it today:. First to move. It's not the sort of thing that smartphone owners today probably remember -- if they're even old enough. But the Nokia 1011, released in 1992, was the first commercially available mobile phone that operated on what's called the GSM network. The letters stand for Global System for Mobile. And what that meant was that unlike earlier phones, the Nokia could be used to make a phone call from almost anywhere in the world. GSM is still the world's most widely used mobile system, although 4G is expected eventually to replace it. Phone as fashion statement. A phone is just a phone, right? Of course not. Today, there are plenty of folks who, admit it or not, wrap at least a small part of their identity up in what kind of phone is in their pocket. That was a pretty alien concept up until the early 2000s when, if you owned a cell phone, there was a pretty good chance it was a Nokia. Remember those chunky, rounded models with the tiny gray screens and the nubby antennas? The Nokia 5110 was one of the most popular. And it also was one of the market's first phones that had a replaceable face plate. The plates came in a wide variety of colors, offering one of the first chances to personalize your phone's look. The 'slider' The popularity of early Nokia phones meant the company's designs often became the standard for cell phones. It didn't create the first flip phone (that honor belongs to Motorola), but the \\"slider\\" was all Nokia. The first was the company's 8110 model, which debuted in 1998. How cutting edge was the design at the time? It was the phone of choice in the futuristic 1999 sci-fi film \\"The Matrix.\\" Mobile gaming. Remember \\"Snake\\"? It seems laughably simple compared with the range of gaming possible on today's smartphones. But plenty got addicted to this game. Even though it had already been in arcades, Nokia began preloading \\"Snake\\" on its phones in 1998. Don't hit your own tail. Don't hit the walls. And what the heck were those things you were eating, anyway? Who knows -- but \\"Angry Birds,\\" \\"Candy Crush\\" and their app-store brethren owe a tip of the digital cap to Nokia's vision of telephone-as-gaming-device. Windows warrior. Phones running the Windows operating system haven't exactly set the marketplace on fire. In the second quarter of this year, 7.4 million phones running Windows were sold, according to Gartner Research. That's a long way behind the No. 2 system, Apple's iOS, with 31.9 million phones sold in that time. But Nokia has squarely positioned itself as the leading vendor of those Windows phones, making 82% of the devices sold last year. In 2011, Windows and Nokia announced a partnership in which Nokia switched to the Windows OS as the default system running all of its handsets. That hasn't been enough to put Nokia on super-solid ground, at least not yet. But the longstanding partnership is what led to Monday's purchase, and if having in-house hardware gives Windows Phone a boost, Microsoft and Nokia will reap the rewards. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"Nokia has played a significant role in shaping the world of mobile electronics.

International Women's Day is observed annually on March 8th to recognize the achievements and contributions of women worldwide, as well as to raise awareness about women's rights and promote gender equality. This event commemorates the social, economic, cultural, and political accomplishments of women across the globe. International Women's Day has its origins in the early 20th century. The first Women's Day was celebrated in 1909 in the United States, in response to the garment workers' strike in 1908, where women protested against poor working conditions and low wages. The event gained international recognition after being adopted by the Socialist International at the 1910 Copenhagen conference. It was officially named International Women's Day in 1911 and was first celebrated on the 19th of March that same year. Since 1913, International Women's Day has been observed on the 8th of March, and it was finally adopted by the United Nations in 1975 during the International Women's Year. Each year, International Women's Day has a specific theme to focus on different aspects of gender equality and women's empowerment. In 2011, the theme was \\"Equal access to education, training, and science and technology: Pathway to decent work for women.\\" This theme aimed to highlight the importance of proper education and skills development for women, enabling them to achieve their full potential and contribute to society.

Considered by almost all the critics to be the best of the Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan films, I have no argument with that, although there are a couple of others I thought just as entertaining. One thing: it's the longest of the series that I've seen at 105 minutes. I've only seen six of them but this was longer than I'm used to and with the drawn-out action finale I thought the whole thing was a bit too long. Nonetheless, it is a good mixture of action, suspense and romance. The only things missing are color and stereo sound. The primitive special-effects don't bother me, as that was all that they had back in the 1930s.

Positive] The Shawshank Redemption, a riveting and timeless classic, earns its place as one of the most adored and respected movies in the annals of cinema history. This gem of a film, directed by the talented Frank Darabont and based on Stephen King's novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, immerses its audience in a world of friendship, hope, and redemption. The masterpiece of storytelling unfolds within the walls of Shawshank State Penitentiary, where we encounter Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), an unassuming banker wrongfully convicted of the brutal murder of his wife and her lover. Over the years, enduring hardships within the confining walls and forming an unbreakable bond with an empathetic inmate named Ellis \\"Red\\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), Andy's indomitable spirit exemplifies the incredible power of hope. The movie shines, not only with its challenging narrative, but also with a star-studded cast who deliver captivating performances. Tim Robbins excels as the enigmatic Andy Dufresne, evoking a sense of vulnerability and stoicism. Despite his character's questionable circumstances, viewers find themselves rooting for Andy through every struggle. Morgan Freeman's portrayal of Red is nothing short of phenomenal. His wit, sarcasm, and enduring wisdom forge a character that becomes the beating heart of the story. Freeman's voice-over narration is the icing on the cake, his dulcet tones guiding us through the years at Shawshank, captivating us with his storytelling prowess. The supporting cast creates a rich tapestry of characters that enhance the narrative to new heights. Clancy Brown as the ruthless Captain Byron Hadley and Bob Gunton as the self-righteous, corrupt Warden Samuel Norton contribute to the film's spectrum of emotions, inciting anger and frustration among viewers at their immoral actions. Yet, each actor delivers a performance that humanizes their character, adding depth and authenticity to the world of Shawshank. Cinematographer Roger Deakins masterfully captures the essence of Shawshank, employing visual storytelling that echoes the film's themes of hope and freedom. From the daunting architecture of Shawshank State Penitentiary to the dramatic downpour in the memorable escape scene, Deakins' shots encapsulate the tone and narrative of the film, leaving a lasting impact. Thomas Newman's poignant score accentuates the emotional beats of the movie, subtly manipulating the viewers' emotions to evoke hope, grief, and triumph. The soundtrack is as timeless as the film itself, skillfully weaving itself into the fabric of each scene, creating an immersive experience for the audience. The Shawshank Redemption stands tall as a testament to the importance of storytelling in cinema. Over two decades since its initial release, the film resonates with audiences across generational gaps, garnering a cult following and solidifying its place in popular culture. A study in friendship, resilience, and the indomitable nature of the human spirit, this film is a must-watch for anyone seeking a truly immersive cinematic experience, captivating the viewer from beginning to end.

Two brothers studied chemistry in school. Ted studied alkanes, while Ned studied cycloalkanes. They both received grade A. Which brother learned less about ethane? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Both Ted and Ned studied different types of hydrocarbons in their chemistry courses, with Ted focusing on alkanes and Ned on cycloalkanes. Before we can determine which brother learned less about ethane, let's briefly explain the differences between alkanes and cycloalkanes. Alkanes are saturated hydrocarbons, which means they consist only of carbon and hydrogen atoms with single bonds between them. The general formula for alkanes is CnH2n+2, where n is the number of carbon atoms. They are also referred to as paraffins and are the simplest type of hydrocarbon. Some common examples of alkanes include methane (CH4), ethane (C2H6), propane (C3H8), and butane (C4H10). Alkanes are known to have relatively low reactivity due to their single covalent bonds, which makes them relatively stable and unreactive. Cycloalkanes, on the other hand, are also saturated hydrocarbons, but they differ from alkanes in that their carbon atoms are arranged in a closed ring or cyclic structure. The general formula for cycloalkanes is CnH2n, where n is the number of carbon atoms in the ring. Some well-known examples of cycloalkanes include cyclopropane (C3H6), cyclobutane (C4H8), cyclopentane (C5H10), and cyclohexane (C6H12). Cycloalkanes have higher reactivity compared to alkanes due to the presence of ring strain, which results from the deviation of bond angles from the ideal 109.5° found in tetrahedral carbon atoms. Now, let's consider the case of ethane. Ethane (C2H6) is an alkane, as it consists of two carbon and six hydrogen atoms bonded together with single bonds and does not have a cyclic structure like cycloalkanes. As ethane is part of the alkane group, Ted, who studied alkanes, would have learned about ethane during his course. On the other hand, since ethane is not a cycloalkane, Ned would probably not have covered ethane in his study of cycloalkanes. In conclusion, we can infer that Ned, who studied cycloalkanes, learned less about ethane compared to Ted, who studied alkanes. While both brothers received an A in their respective courses, Ted would have gained a more in-depth understanding of ethane since it falls under the category of alkanes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 3: Introduce secondary characters and raise tensions As Jamie delves further into the dark secrets woven into the town's history, he encounters several townsfolk who are suspicious and secretive, as well as a more intimate connection with Clara, played by a well-known actress, the granddaughter of the town's librarian with deep ties to the past. Step 4: The nursery rhyme begins to haunt Jamie In the midst of this newfound connection, Jamie starts to hear the nursery rhyme echoing throughout his home at night, and it becomes increasingly difficult for him to separate reality from hallucination. This not only affects his work, but his relationship with Clara as well. Step 5: Jamie's search for the truth intensifies Driven by an inexplicable connection to Alice and her fate, Jamie is determined to uncover the truth, no matter the cost to his own sanity or safety. In doing so, he starts to question if his own family may have been involved in the tragedy. Step 6: The climax of the plot In the climax, Jamie finally pieces together the puzzle. It turns out the killer was one of the town's most respected elders who has since passed away, but the incident had been covered up. The town librarian, with deep regret, realized Jamie's connection to the nursery rhyme because Jamie's mother used to say that rhyme to him when he was a baby. Step 7: Resolution of the story With the truth finally out in the open, the town begins to heal from its dark past. Jamie and Clara reconcile and grow closer, building a new future together. Jamie's experience with unraveling this mystery ultimately serves as the foundation for his next best-selling novel, an ode to the resilience of the human spirit in the face of tragedy and darkness.

Review: It was the Sixties, and anyone with long hair and a hip, distant attitude could get money to make a movie. That's how Michael Sarne, director of this colossal flop, was able to get the job. Sarne is one of the most supremely untalented people ever given a dollar to make a movie. In fact, the whole studio must have been tricked into agreeing to hire a guy who had made exactly one previous film, a terribly precious 60's-hip black and white featurette called Joanna. That film starred the similarly talentless actress/waif Genevieve Waite who could barely speak an entire line without breaking into some inappropriate facial expression or bat-like twitter. Sarne, who was probably incapable of directing a cartoon, never mind a big-budget Hollywood film, was in way over his head. David Giler's book is the best place to go to find out how the faux-infant terrible Sarne was able to pull the wool over everyone's eyes. If there is ever an historical marker which indicates the superficiality and shallowness of an era, Myra Breckinridge provides that marker. It embodies the emptiness and mindless excess of a decade which is more often remembered for a great sea-change in the body politic. Breckinridge is a touchstone of another, equally important vein. Watch this movie and you'll get a different perspective on the less-often mentioned vacuity of spirit which so often passed for talent during those years. Many reviewers have spoken about the inter-cutting of footage from other films, especially older ones. Some actually liked these clunky \\"comments\\" on what was taking place in the movie, others found them senseless, annoying, and obtrusive, though since the film is so bad itself any intrusion would have to be an improvement. In my opinion, the real reason Michael Sarne put so many film clips into Myra Brekinridge was to paper over the bottomless insufficiency of wit and imagination that he possessed. That is to say, Sarne was so imagination-challenged that he just threw these clips in to fill space and take up time. They weren't inspiration, they were desperation. His writing skills were nonexistent, and David Giler had wisely stepped away from the project as one might from a ticking bomb, so Sarne was left to actually try and make a movie, and he couldn't. It was beyond his slim capabilities. Hence the introduction of what seems like one half of an entire film's worth of clips. The ghosts of writers and directors - many long since passed on - were called upon to fix this calamitous flopperoo because Sarne sure as heck wasn't able to. This was what he came up with on those days he sat on the set and thought for eight hours while the entire cast and crew (not to mention the producers and the accountants) cooled their heels and waited for something, some great spark of imagination, a hint of originality, a soupcon of wit, to crackle forth from the brow of Zeus. Um, oops. No Zeus + no imagination + no sparks = millions of little dollar bills with tiny wings - each made from the hundreds of licensing agreements required to use the clips - flying out the window. Bye-bye. As for myself, I hated the film clips. They denigrated Sarne's many betters, poked fun at people whose talents - even those whose skills were not great - far outstripped the abilities of the director and so ultimately served to show how lacking he was in inspiration, originality - and even of plain competency - compared to even the cheesiest of them. Now, what is this review like? Select from the following. 1). negative 2). positive","completion":"This review can be categorized as negative, since the reviewer expresses strong dissatisfaction with the film Myra Breckinridge. They criticize the director Michael Sarne as untalented and unimaginative, pointing out the poor quality of his work across both writing and directing aspects. Moreover, the film clips included in the movie were seen as a desperate attempt to cover up the lack of wit and originality, ultimately making the movie a flop. The reviewer's opinion on the film clips was also negative, as they found them denigrating, annoying, and obtrusive. Overall, the review highlights the emptiness, superficiality, and shallowness of the era and considers Myra Breckinridge as a touchstone of the vacuity of spirit that was present during the 60s."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

That place had houses that were almost the same size and their burial sites were also similar. That means people there were more equal and they didn't think about who had more stuff or money.

The saddest story I ever heard was from the kid in my AP Lit class who had taken her senior year to accept invitations from education reform groups to speak around the country, which she did, without doing any of her homework. She waited until after grades were turned in at the end of the year to contest the “D” on her report card because it meant not going to UC Berkeley. She brought her mother with her, and her two sisters.

She deserved to go to Cal! They were all in tears. The principal found a way to change her 64% to a 70.01%, and off she went.

Leaving Juan Agudelo off roster costs U.S. its place in Under-20 World Cup No matter what other excuses are offered, the simple truth is that the U.S. failed to qualify for this summer's FIFA Under-20 World Cup because it failed to include New York Red Bulls forward Juan Agudelo on its roster.For that, Coach Thomas Rongen and his staff must take the blame -- unless it turns out that the Red Bulls refused to release the 18-year-old rising star.The U.S., which had qualified for the previous seven editions of the tournament, was knocked out of contention on Wednesday night when it lost, 2-1, to Guatemala in the quarterfinals of the regional qualifying tournament.The four quarterfinal winners -- Guatemala, Costa Rica, Mexico and Panama -- each qualified for the Under-20 World Cup, to be played in Colombia July 29 through Aug. 20.But the U.S. fell by the wayside because it could not score the goals that Agudelo very likely could have provided. If he is capable of scoring goals for the full U.S. national team against the likes of South Africa and Argentina, then he most definitely would not have been intimidated by the crowd at the Estadio Nacional Mateo Flores in Guatemala City.Even Rongen afterward admitted that Agudelo could have made a difference. \\"In hindsight, if you have [Norwegian-based winger] Josh Gatt here or Juan Agudelo, obviously your options off the bench are a little bit better,\\" he said. But Agudelo should not even have been considered as a substitute. He should have started the match. It was in the early going, when Guatemala still was unsure of the opposition it was facing, that the game was lost. That's when goal-poacher Agudelo could have taken advantage. \\"I think we lost the game early on, with two or three very good chances in the first 10 minutes,\\" Rongen said. \\"That sometimes, or a lot of times, comes back to haunt you.\\" Guatemala, urged on by a vocal crowd of 13,805, took the lead on a goal by Gerson Lima. The U.S. tied it up when Conor Doyle found the back of the net but, three minutes after Doyle's goal, Henry Lopez scored the winner for the host nation. Costa Rica routed Cuba, 6-1; Mexico shut out Canada, 3-0, and Panama upset Honduras, 2-0, to earn their places alongside Guatemala in the world championship.

For example, you could say, \\"I love that you help with the kids, but I don't like when you contradict the rules that I've made.\\" You could also say, \\"I respect your rules when I'm in your house, but I don't like being asked where I am every second of every day.\\" Tell them what you expect. For instance, you could say, \\"I would really appreciate if you would respect the rules I've set for my kids.\\" or \\"I would appreciate it if you would treat me like any other adult who stays in your home.\\" If you're telling your mom a story, tell her what you expect from her upfront. For instance, if you're just telling her the story to give her information and you don't really want advice, let her know that. You could say, \\"Mom, I need to tell you something, but I want you to promise me that you won't offer your judgment at the end. I feel like you need to know this information, but I don't want advice on my choices.\\" That is, often in communication, people are trying to maintain control. It's a power struggle. Often, this type of communication pops up between a parent and an adult child, or even another type of relationship, such as an aunt and niece or nephew. The \\"adult\\" still wants to control the adult child, even if that person doesn't realize it. If you're the adult child, you may want to struggle to \\"win\\" in this situation. However, often letting go of the power struggle can lead to a healthier relationship. This type of power struggle can make people defensive. You probably feel defensive when another adult in your family, whether it be a parent, aunt, guardian, or grandparent, does it to you. However, by truly listening and letting go of the power struggle, you can cut through some of that defensiveness and both parties can feel more heard and valued. Sometimes, parents and other family members have trouble respecting boundaries because they still see you as a little kid they have a right to rule over. In that case, you need to politely but firmly set boundaries with them because you have your own life now. For instance, say your parents tend to just show up at your house unannounced. You could say, \\"We love having you here, but we'd appreciate it if you gave us some advanced notice. Sometimes, we have our family time planned, and we need that time to strengthen and grow together.\\" Another way you could address an issue is to say, \\"I understand that you are concerned about when we're having children. However, it may be some time before we decide to do so. I will definitely let you know when we're thinking about it. Until then, I would appreciate it if you stop asking about it.\\" Summary:","completion":"The article discusses strategies for adults to communicate their feelings and set boundaries with older family members who still treat them as children, advocating for respectful conversations, avoiding blame, and understanding the dynamics of power struggles."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts. Each of those parts will have some instruction. Explain their meaning by showing an example that meets the criteria in the instruction. Use the following format: Part # : a key part of the definition. Usage: Sample response that meets the criteria from the key part. Explain why you think it meets the criteria. In this task you will be given a list of integers. A list contains numbers separated by a comma. You need to round every integer to the closest power of 2. A power of 2 is a number in the form '2^n', it is a number that is the result of multiplying by 2 n times. The following are all powers of 2, '2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096'.

Usage: Sample input: 210; Closest power of 2: 256. 210 is closer to 256 (46 difference) than to 128 (82 difference). Therefore, 210 should be rounded to 256. Part #3: If an integer is equally far from two different powers of 2, output the larger power of 2. Usage: Sample input: 20; Equally far from powers of 2: 16 and 32. Since 20 is 4 units away from both 16 and 32, the larger power of 2 (32) should be the output. Part #4: Present the output as a list of integers enclosed in square brackets.

Given the question: Question: \\"Where did the mascot of Notre Dame first appear?\\" Context: \\"Notre Dame's conference affiliations for all of its sports except football and fencing changed in July 2013 as a result of major conference realignment, and its fencing affiliation will change in July 2014. The Irish left the Big East for the ACC during a prolonged period of instability in the Big East; while they maintain their football independence, they have committed to play five games per season against ACC opponents. In ice hockey, the Irish were forced to find a new conference home after the Big Ten Conference's decision to add the sport in 2013–14 led to a cascade of conference moves that culminated in the dissolution of the school's former hockey home, the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, after the 2012–13 season. Notre Dame moved its hockey team to Hockey East. After Notre Dame joined the ACC, the conference announced it would add fencing as a sponsored sport beginning in the 2014–15 school year. There are many theories behind the adoption of the athletics moniker but it is known that the Fighting Irish name was used in the early 1920s with respect to the football team and was popularized by alumnus Francis Wallace in his New York Daily News columns. The official colors of Notre Dame are Navy Blue and Gold Rush which are worn in competition by its athletic teams. In addition, the color green is often worn because of the Fighting Irish nickname. The Notre Dame Leprechaun is the mascot of the athletic teams. Created by Theodore W. Drake in 1964, the leprechaun was first used on the football pocket schedule and later on the football program covers.

Please answer the following question: Given the fact that: For bases we can state the folllowing: The higher the pH of a substance, the more basic it is. Answer the question: John was looking at the bases and noticed something. The lower the pH of the substance, the amount of basic it was Increased or Decreased? A:","completion":"John observed a correlation between pH and the basicity of a substance. When considering the pH scale, a value of 7 is considered neutral, with values above 7 being basic (alkaline), and values below 7 being acidic. As the pH value increases, the basicity of the substance increases. Conversely, as the pH value decreases, the acidity of the substance increases. In John's observation, he noticed that as the pH of a substance decreased, the degree of basicity appeared to change. In this situation, the amount of basicity was actually decreasing. To elaborate, consider two base substances with the following pH values: 1. Base A with a pH of 12 2. Base B with a pH of 9 Base A, with a pH of 12, is more basic than Base B, which has a pH of 9. Now, if we were to look at a substance with a lower pH value, let's say pH 8 or 5, its basicity would decrease even further, making it less basic than both Base A and Base B. In summary, as the pH of a substance decreases, its basicity decreases as well. As a result, the substance becomes less basic and potentially moves towards the acidic range on the pH scale. John's observation, therefore, can be concluded as follows: the lower the pH of the substance, the amount of basicity it has decreased."},{"prompt":"I heard that Aubrey was promptly fired after she was caught stealing office supplies.

Running an art gallery; Given those answer options, answer the question: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: I’ve learnt a great amount throughout this studio, first and foremost I was taught: how the art world functions, how specific galleries such as Gertrude St Contemporary run and how artists earn a living. The studio also provided me with basic filmmaking skills such as how to: create a shooting schedule, write a shooting script, set up three-point lighting, conduct an interview, utilise visual storytelling and edit a short film. Throughout the shooting process with my artist I also developed my abilities regarding how to use a: Sony Zoom H2N (and other such handy recorders), a lapel mic, my own Canon EOS 60D and Adobe Premiere Pro editing software. Overall I think the studio functioned quite successfully, it was great to be in a studio with nineteen people who all were interested in the same topics as you. I felt that overall, the studios had a very happy and supportive environment, and you walked away knowing a great deal about the art world and how to make short documentaries. The project itself taught me a great deal about how to work with talent, as well as my group members. Having to work independently forced me to be completely all over every aspect of the shoot, whether that be choosing which questions to ask, deciding what to focus on, where I wanted the shoot to happen, deciding what gear to use, getting to the shoot, carrying all the gear, what I wanted to shoot, managing the audio, managing the lighting, managing the camera set-ups, managing the talent, editing the film, and finding a great soundtrack for it. I’m a pretty self-conscious person and I often doubt the decisions I make or ask someone else for their opinion (should I shoot this angle, or what do you think of this question etc.). Working independently pushed me to go with my gut instincts, to make decisions and to not seek others approval. It forced me to develop my aesthetic as a filmmaker and to own the work that I ended up producing, so ultimately I was really glad with how everything panned out. Question: Before the author took the studio, it is most likely he had experience: Answer: A:","completion":"Running a video camera; Before the author took the studio, it is most likely they had experience running a video camera. The context provided shows that the author gained a deeper understanding of the art world, filmmaking skills, and using various tools and software during the course of the studio. However, it is implied that they already owned a Canon EOS 60D, which suggests they had prior experience with video cameras. Throughout the studio, the author developed their skills in creating a shooting schedule, writing a shooting script, setting up three-point lighting, and conducting interviews. They also learned about visual storytelling and how to edit a short film. The author became proficient with various equipment, including a Sony Zoom H2N, a lapel mic, and the Adobe Premiere Pro editing software. This knowledge built upon their previous experience with video cameras, as they had to learn new aspects of filmmaking and gain confidence in their abilities. Their experience working independently during the studio pushed them to trust their instincts, make decisions without seeking others' approval, and develop their unique aesthetic as a filmmaker. In conclusion, the author most likely had experience running a video camera before taking the studio, as evidenced by their ownership of a Canon EOS 60D. The studio allowed them to expand their skills, learn more about the art world, and gain confidence as a filmmaker."},{"prompt":"Teacher:In this task, you're given a review from Amazon and rating for the product on a scale of 1-5 based on the review.

Expand this summary.","completion":"Alice Oswald, a highly regarded British poet and a prime contender for the prestigious TS Eliot Prize, has made the decision to withdraw from the contest due to major sponsorship from a hedge fund management firm. The prize, worth 22,000, is a distinguished honor in the world of poetry, and Oswald's new collection, Memorial—a retelling of the Iliad—had been expected to be a strong candidate for the award. Oswald is no stranger to the accolade either; she won the TS Eliot Prize back in 2002 for another one of her collections. Her decision to withdraw from the competition is based on her discomfort with the financial backing from Aurum Funds, an investment company that exclusively manages hedge funds. In a statement, Oswald expressed her unease, saying, \\"I'm uncomfortable about the fact that Aurum Funds… is sponsoring the administration of the Eliot Prize. I think poetry should be questioning, not endorsing, such institutions and for that reason, I'm withdrawing from the Eliot shortlist.\\" The Poetry Book Society, which faces potential loss of funding due to government budget cuts, recently announced that Aurum Funds would be sponsoring the prize with a three-year commitment. However, Oswald's withdrawal from the contest seems to suggest that the connection between the world of poetry and institutions that many perceive to be profiteers of global inequalities doesn't sit well with her. So far, neither the Poetry Book Society nor Aurum Funds have responded or provided any remarks on Oswald's statement, as reported by the Guardian. Whether or not other poets will follow suit, showing solidarity and shared values with Oswald, remains to be seen. However, her withdrawal highlights the potentially problematic alliance between the arts and financial institutions—a relationship that has faced increased scrutiny in recent years due to the reputations and practices of many large corporations and their perceived roles in fuelling inequality and environmental degradation. As the story unfolds, it will be interesting to see whether the Poetry Book Society and Aurum Funds can find common ground in the world of arts sponsorship or if other artists choose to take a stand on similar principles as Oswald. In the end, the decision of whether sponsorship in the arts should be exempt from scrutiny based on the source of the funding or if there should be higher expectations for how the humanities should hold themselves accountable in the age of global impact and interconnectedness is a question that may continue to resonate and provoke debate among the artistic community."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Emoticons are an additional aspect of text message communication that helps convey the sender's feelings or emotions. They are created using various keyboard symbols and are meant to be read sideways. Emoticons are useful in text messaging because they can quickly demonstrate the intended tone or emotion behind text, which may be otherwise unclear due to the abbreviated nature of the messages. In the multiple-choice question about why people use emoticons, the best answer is option A) Because they can show how users feel. Emoticons serve as a visual way to express emotions in the shorthand world of text messaging, where words and punctuation may be minimally used. This helps prevent misinterpretations of the sender's intended meaning while facilitating a more engaging and personable communication experience. Option B (because the symbols are beautiful) is not a primary reason for using emoticons; it is more about their functionality. Option C (because text messages are short) indirectly relates to emoticon usage, but it is not the main reason.

To that end, they developed a transgenic crop with the help of Bt toxin - they referred to it as case A. To test the effectiveness of this new crop they also studied Bt toxin spray - they referred to it as case B. They need to figure out which case is safer for the environment. But I can use this background: There is growing concern regarding the use of pesticides in agriculture. Therefore, many of the current commercial applications of modern biotechnology in agriculture are focused on reducing the dependence of farmers on these chemicals. For example, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is a soil bacterium that produces a protein that can act as an insecticide, known as the Bt toxin . But it is a naturally occurring protein, not a foreign chemical. Could this protein be used in crops instead of pesticides? Traditionally, an insecticidal spray has been produced from these bacteria. As a spray, the Bt toxin is in an inactive state and requires digestion by an insect to become active and have any effect. Crop plants have now been engineered to contain and express the genes for the Bt toxin, which they produce in its active form. When an insect ingests the transgenic crop, it stops feeding and soon thereafter dies as a result of the Bt toxin binding to its gut wall. Bt corn is now commercially available in a number of countries to control corn borer (an insect like a moth or butterfly), which is otherwise controlled by insecticidal spraying.

Mr. Fox is working a safe job as a journalist. Against the advice of Badger (voice: Bill Murray), his attorney, he moves his family into a larger and finer home inside a tree on a hill. The treehouse has a good view of the nearby farms of Boggis, Bunce, and Bean.Ash is immediately hostile when his cousin Kristofferson (voice: Eric Chase Anderson) joins the family for an extended visit because his father is sick. He makes the inoffensive Kristofferson sleep under a table in the bedroom they share. Ash feels threatened because his cousin appears to be good at everything. Kristofferson even succeeds at whackbat, a cricket-like game whose baroque rules are explained by Coach Skip (voice: Owen Wilson) -- though Kristofferson has never played it before. Meanwhile, Mr. Fox plots with Kiley (voice: Wallace Wolodarsky), the treehouse's caretaker, to raid the Boggis, Bunce and Bean farms. They take Kristofferson but not Ash along on the raids, which deepens Ash's resentment.

The premise states \\"Two children on the beach.\\" This gives us information about the setting (a beach) and the number of children present (two). The hypothesis states \\"Two kids are racing towards the water at a beach.\\" This gives us additional information about the children's actions, specifically that they are racing towards the water. Step 2: Determine if the premise directly supports the hypothesis. The premise only provides information about the setting and the presence of two children. It does not provide any information about their actions. The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests a specific action - the kids racing towards the water. Step 3: Assess the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. The hypothesis is not directly supported by the premise, as the premise does not provide any information about the children's actions. However, the two statements are not contradictory, and it is possible for the hypothesis to be true given the premise. Conclusion: We cannot conclude with certainty that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true, because there is no direct connection between the information in the premise and the information in the hypothesis.

Facing both rising temperatures and a growing population, China's demand for water resources has increased significantly, leaving many regions struggling to meet the needs of their people. Water scarcity has become a pressing issue for China, as climate change intensifies and exacerbates drought conditions across the country. The prolonged heatwaves have caused rivers, lakes, and reservoirs to diminish at an alarming rate, significantly impacting agricultural production and the availability of drinking water. In response to this urgent situation, the Chinese government has taken several initiatives to mitigate the looming water crisis. These measures include launching campaigns to raise public awareness regarding water conservation, investing in water-efficient technologies, and implementing stricter laws to regulate industrial water usage. Additionally, projects such as the South-North Water Diversion Project aim to redirect water from the resource-rich south, mitigating water shortages in the arid regions of northern China. While this ambitious undertaking seeks to alleviate the current crisis, critics argue that long-term, sustainable solutions must also be sought. It is evident that concerted efforts must be made to conserve water, reduce wastage, and explore alternative options for securing sufficient water resources for China's burgeoning populace. The government, industries, and the public alike need to work together, demonstrating a strong sense of responsibility to protect and effectively utilize the country's water supply. In conclusion, the sweltering summer heat in China has brought to light the alarming issue of water shortages, demanding immediate and decisive action. The government's efforts to address the problem are commendable, but continued vigilance and global cooperation are essential to ensure a sustainable future for the country's water resources."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Roberto Mangabeira Unger (; born 24 March 1947) is a philosopher and politician. He has developed his views and positions across many fields, including social, political, and economic theory. In legal theory, he is best known by his work in the 1970s and 80s while at Harvard Law School as part of the Critical Legal Studies movement, which is held to have helped disrupt the methodological consensus in American law schools. His political activity helped the transition to democracy in Brazil in the aftermath of the military regime, and culminated with his appointment as Brazil's Minister of Strategic Affairs in 2007 and again in 2015. The beginning of Unger's academic career began with the books Knowledge and Politics and Law in Modern Society, published in 1975 and 1976 respectively. These works led to the co-founding of Critical Legal Studies (CLS) with Duncan Kennedy and Morton Horwitz. The movement stirred up controversy in legal schools across America as it challenged standard legal scholarship and made radical proposals for legal education. By the early 1980s, the CLS movement touched off a heated internal debate at Harvard, pitting the CLS scholars against the older, more traditional scholars. Throughout much of the 1980s, Unger worked on his magnum opus, Politics: A Work In Constructive Social Theory, a three volume work that assessed classical social theory and developed a political, social, and economic alternative. The series is based on the premise of society as an artifact, and rejects the necessity of certain institutional arrangements. Published in 1987, Politics was foremost a critique of contemporary social theory and politics; it developed a theory of structural and ideological change, and gave an alternative account of world history. By first attacking the idea that there is a necessary progression from one set of institutional arrangements to another, e.g. feudalism to capitalism, it then built an anti-necessitarian theory of social change, theorizing the transition from one set of institutional arrangements to another. Unger devoted much of the following decades to further elaborating on the insights developed in Politics by working out the political and social alternatives. What Should Legal Analysis Become? (Verso, 1996) developed tools to reimagine the organization of social life. Democracy Realized: The Progressive Alternative (Verso, 1998) and What Should the Left Propose? (Verso, 2005) put forth alternative institutional proposals. What did Unger do in or with Politics ?","completion":"In his magnum opus, Politics: A Work In Constructive Social Theory, Roberto Unger aimed to critique and reformulate contemporary social, political, and economic thought. The three-volume work was published in 1987 and served several purposes: 1. Assessing Classical Social Theory: Unger evaluated the existing social theories and their limitations, laying the groundwork for developing alternative approaches. 2. Developing a Political, Social, and Economic Alternative: Based on the premise of society as an artifact, Unger formulated alternative political, social, and economic ideas that rejected the necessity of specific institutional arrangements. 3. Critiquing Contemporary Social Theory and Politics: Unger questioned the widely-accepted idea of a necessary progression from one set of institutional arrangements to another (e.g., from feudalism to capitalism). 4. Building an Anti-Necessitarian Theory of Social Change: He put forth a theory that explored the transition from one set of institutional arrangements to another without assuming a predetermined or necessary path. 5. Offering Alternative Institutional Proposals: In developing his approach, Unger proposed novel ways to reorganize social life and establish alternative institutional structures in society. Through the work Politics, Unger challenged the prevailing concepts in social theory and proposed a new framework that allowed for greater flexibility and potential for change in our understanding of political, social, and economic structures."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article: A review, published in the American Journal of Psychiatry, also suggests these patients are less likely to respond to treatment. Nearly one in 20 people in the UK has this form of depression as a result of childhood abuse, say researchers. The charity Sane said the study highlighted how damaging childhood trauma could be. Depression in some form can affect one in five people at some point in their lives. Researchers at the Institute of Psychiatry at Kings College London were investigating depression which keeps on recurring. They reviewed 16 studies, on a total of more than 23,000 patients, and found that maltreatment in childhood - such as rejection by the mother, harsh physical treatment or sexual abuse - more than doubled the risk of this type of depression. One of the researchers, Dr Rudolf Uher, said: \\"If these things happen early in life, it is more powerful.\\" In the UK, 16% of people develop persistent depression by the age of 33. A quarter of them, or 4% of the whole UK population, were maltreated as a child. In the study: A separate review on 3,098 people showed childhood maltreatment was also linked to a poorer response to both drug and psychological treatment. Lead researcher Dr Andrea Danese said: \\"Even for combined treatments, patients with a history of childhood maltreatment cannot be adequately cared for.\\" Their report suggests \\"early preventive and therapeutic interventions may be more effective.\\" There is no precise explanation of any link between abuse, changes in the body as a child and persistent depression 20 or more years later. Childhood maltreatment, it is thought, causes changes to the brain, immune system and some hormone glands - some of which are still present in adulthood. One possible mechanism is what is known as epigenetic changes to the DNA. While there is no change in the genetic code, the environment can alter the way genes are expressed. Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of the mental health charity Sane, said: \\"It may seem obvious that traumatic events in our lives can make us depressed, but this study highlights how particularly damaging such traumas can be when experienced during childhood, when our brains are still developing. \\"We should all be concerned at how abuse and neglect creates a painful legacy that can last a lifetime, increasing our chances of experiencing repeated episodes of depression and reducing the effects of those treatments that are available to us. \\"Yet we should not lose hope. Research such as this can point the way to better treatments and preventative measures.\\"","completion":"A review in the American Journal of Psychiatry suggests that people who experience childhood abuse are more likely to have a certain type of depression that is hard to treat. Researchers at Kings College London found that childhood maltreatment, like being rejected by a parent, experiencing physical punishment, or sexual abuse, more than doubled the risk of this type of depression. In the UK, 4% of the whole population experienced this type of abuse and later had ongoing depression. The researchers think that early help and support might work better for these people. Childhood trauma can change the brain, immune system, and some hormone glands, which can still affect a person as an adult.

She thought of a special outfit called a pantsuit that Hillary used to wear a lot, and she started a group on Facebook where people could join to wear pantsuits too, just like Hillary. The group was called Pantsuit Nation, and it grew very, very big! People who joined the group started to feel happy and hopeful, because they saw other people just like them wearing pantsuits. It became a friendly place where people who liked Hillary could talk to each other and feel safe, without getting into arguments with people who liked the other man who wanted to be the leader, named Donald Trump. Soon, Pantsuit Nation had millions of members, and they all wore pantsuits on the day when people went to vote for their leader. They even raised a lot of money to help Hillary in her campaign to be the leader. Libby was very happy and hoped that maybe someday, their special group could help make some important changes in their big country.

Given the below context: Aspiring filmmaker Sean is working as a freelance driver to make ends meet. He's assigned to deliver an expensive Mercedes-Benz from Los Angeles all the way to its owner in Miami, which will also allow him to attend the wedding of his sister. He's given strict instructions not to damage the vehicle or pick up any hitchhikers. Sean is driving cross country when he picks up Nick, a hitchhiker who happens to be a vampire hunter hunting a group of vampires led by one of the Forsaken--a group of knights who made a pact with the fallen angel Abaddon to live forever. Two of the Forsaken are located in the United States (including the one Nick is tracking, Kit). Nick was bitten and infected by a vampire but, thanks to an antiviral drug cocktail, the vampire virus is kept at bay. Each of the Forsaken carry a unique strain of vampirism; killing a Forsaken kills his entire bloodline and reverses the condition of anyone infected. Nick believes that if he kills Kit, he will be cured before he turns (as the drug cocktail eventually will lose effect). At first Sean is less than willing to indulge his new acquaintance; however, he is convinced after the two come across a disoriented young woman, Megan, at a diner, who was bitten by the vampires and left for dead. Nick also proves he is telling the truth by killing a vampire, Teddy, with exposure to sunlight. Sean and Nick take Megan to their motel room, but she goes into a rage and bites Sean; they realize they must kill the Forsaken responsible to prevent Sean from turning.

The arrangement of type involves selecting typefaces, point sizes, line lengths, line-spacing (leading), and letter-spacing (tracking), and adjusting the space between pairs of letters (kerning). The term typography is also applied to the style, arrangement, and appearance of the letters, numbers, and symbols created by the process. Type design is a closely related craft, sometimes considered part of typography; most typographers do not design typefaces, and some type designers do not consider themselves typographers. Typography also may be used as a decorative device, unrelated to communication of information. - The Coimbra Group (CG) is an association of long-established European multidisciplinary universities of high international standard.

I can use this background: Baker's yeast is the common name for the strains of yeast commonly used in baking bread and bakery products, serving as a leavening agent which causes the bread to rise (expand and become lighter and softer) by converting the fermentable sugars present in the dough into carbon dioxide and ethanol. Baker's yeast is of the species Saccharomyces cerevisiae,[1] and is the same species (but a different strain) as the kind commonly used in alcoholic fermentation, which is called brewer's yeast.[2] Baker's yeast is also a single-cell microorganism found on and around the human body.

This is because they used brewer's yeast, which is a different strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae compared to baker's yeast. Although both baker's yeast and brewer's yeast belong to the same species, they are adapted for different functions. Baker's yeast is specifically designed for bread making, whereas brewer's yeast is designed for alcoholic fermentation, such as in beer production. Baker's yeast has been selectively bred for its ability to produce a high volume of carbon dioxide, which causes the dough to rise. In contrast, brewer's yeast prioritizes the production of alcohol and may not produce as much carbon dioxide, resulting in a less effective leavening agent for bread making. Group B brewed beer with brewer's yeast, but they baked bread using baker's yeast, the appropriate yeast strain for bread making. This allowed their dough to rise more effectively since baker's yeast is specifically adapted for leavening bread dough."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Let's break down each motto and examine them in further detail before getting to the hypothesis \\"There was no motto.\\" 1. \\"Better to live one day as a lion than 100 years as a sheep.\\" This motto reflects the idea that it is preferable to live with courage, strength, and power for a shorter period rather than live a long life as a passive follower without taking risks. This serves as a representation of the fascist doctrine, emphasizing the importance of self-sacrifice, heroism, and national superiority. This motto embodies the Italian Fascist Regime's motivation to assert dominance in the political realm and to hold strong beliefs in their national identity. It also inspires the masses to commit to the cause and aspire towards valor and bravery. 2. \\"Credere, obbedire, combattere\\" meaning \\"Believe, obey, fight.\\" This second motto acts as a call to action for Mussolini's followers, defining the core tenets of the fascist ideology: complete loyalty and obedience to the regime, unwavering belief in the leadership and cause, and a willingness to fight for the nation, even to the point of death. Implementing this motto served to galvanize the Italian population, instilling a sense of duty and forging a strong, unified front to pursue Mussolini's ambitions, both domestically and internationally. Now, returning to the hypothesis \\"There was no motto.\\", we can assess its validity. Since the premise stated two different mottos associated with Mussolini and his regime, the existence of these mottos disproves the hypothesis \\"There was no motto.\\" The presence of contrasting mottos suggests that Mussolini adopted different messaging strategies as circumstances arose. Each motto appealed to different aspects of the Italian population, addressing various motivations, emotions, and ideologies. The first motto inspires courage and strength, while the second urges obedience and commitment. By combining both mottos, Mussolini created an ideological framework that resonates powerfully within the Italian Fascist movement. In conclusion, based on the stated premise, the hypothesis \\"There was no motto.\\" is disproven. The presence of two contrasting mottos demonstrates that Mussolini used multiple guiding principles to mobilize the masses and propagate the ideals of his fascist regime. Each motto served a different purpose within the broader Italian fascist movement, promoting values like courage, loyalty, obedience, and self-sacrifice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He was ordered to serve life in prison with a minimum term of 37 years - the longest sentence ever imposed by a Scottish Court in a murder case. Sinclair argued the sentence was excessive but appeal court judges upheld the decision on Thursday. Appeal judges described Sinclair as somebody with an \\"immeasurable capacity for evil, depravity and sadism\\". The 17-year-olds were killed after a night-out at Edinburgh's World's End pub in October 1977, with their bodies discovered the following day in East Lothian. Sinclair was found guilty of the crimes after a five-week trial and, on sentencing, judge Lord Matthews said Sinclair was a \\"dangerous predator, who is capable of sinking to the depths of depravity\\". The conviction brought to a conclusion one of Scotland's most infamous unsolved cases and marked the first prosecution since changes to the country's double jeopardy law. The legal change meant Sinclair, who has been in prison since the 1980s, could be retried after the court case against him collapsed seven years previously. The judge ordered him to spend a minimum of 37 years in jail - the same number of years that the families of the girls had waited for justice. Last year, Sinclair dropped an appeal against the conviction but continued in a bid to have the term reduced, arguing it was \\"excessive\\". A hearing was held in November but judges have now refused the appeal, meaning the punishment part of Sinclair's sentence will stand. Among the submissions from Sinclair's legal team was the question of whether 37 years was \\"necessary, appropriate and fell within the judge's discretion\\". They also argued about whether or not some of his earlier convictions should have been taken into account in determining the punishment part of the sentence as they were events which came after the 1977 murders. Lady Paton, Lady Clark and Lord Malcolm delivered their opinion in a written judgment published on Thursday. They said: \\"We do not accept that the sentencing judge selected 37 years because that represented the length of time which had passed since the commission of the murders. \\"As the sentencing judge explains, he had concluded at the outset that a punishment part 'in the high 30s' should be imposed. That was his assessment of the gravity of the case. \\"As he puts it, it was only 'coincidentally' that the period selected mirrored the passage of time since the murders. In the result we are not persuaded that there is any merit in this argument.\\" They also rejected the arguments relating to his criminal record and refused the appeal. A Crown Office spokesman said: \\"We note the decision of the appeal court. \\"This brings to an end the long wait for justice for the families of Helen and Christine. \\"This was made possible by the hard work and dedication of all senior investigation officers, police officers, procurators fiscal, forensic scientists, police surgeons, forensic pathologists, forensic soil scientists, toxicologists and other witnesses who willingly gave their time and expertise to bring Angus Sinclair to justice.\\" Summarize the main points of that article.","completion":"In 2014, Angus Sinclair was convicted for the 1977 rape and murder of teenagers Helen Scott and Christine Eadie in Scotland.

In early March, the administration postponed action on proposals for increasing aid to the Northern Alliance and the Uzbeks. Rice noted at the time that a more wide-ranging examination of policy toward Afghanistan was needed first. She wanted the review very soon. Rice and others recalled the President saying, \\"I'm tired of swatting at flies.\\" The President reportedly also said,\\"I'm tired of playing defense. I want to play offense. I want to take the fight to the terrorists.\\" President Bush explained to us that he had become impatient. He apparently had heard proposals for rolling back al Qaeda but felt that catching terrorists one by one or even cell by cell was not an approach likely to succeed in the long run. At the same time, he said, he understood that policy had to be developed slowly so that diplomacy and financial and military measures could mesh with one another. Hadley convened an informal Deputies Committee meeting on March 7, when some of the deputies had not yet been confirmed. For the first time, Clarke's various proposals-for aid to the Northern Alliance and the Uzbeks and for Predator missions-went before the group that, in the Bush NSC, would do most of the policy work. Though they made no decisions on these specific proposals, Hadley apparently concluded that there should be a presidential national security policy directive (NSPD) on terrorism. Clarke would later express irritation about the deputies' insistence that a strategy for coping with al Qaeda be framed within the context of a regional policy. He doubted that the benefits would compensate for the time lost. The administration had in fact proceeded with Principals Committee meetings on topics including Iraq and Sudan without prior contextual review, and Clarke favored moving ahead similarly with a narrow counterterrorism agenda. But the President's senior advisers saw the al Qaeda problem as part of a puzzle that could not be assembled without filling in the pieces for Afghanistan and Pakistan. Rice deferred a Principals Committee meeting on al Qaeda until the deputies had developed a new policy for their consideration.

Plot title: Yellow Submarine Movie plot: Pepperland is a cheerful, music-loving paradise under the sea, protected by Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. The titular Yellow Submarine rests on an Aztec-like pyramid on a hill. At the edge of the land is a range of high blue mountains. The land falls under a surprise attack from the music-hating Blue Meanies, who live in or beyond the blue mountains. The attack starts with magical projectiles fired from big artillery stationed in the blue mountains. The Blue Meanies seal the band inside a music-proof blue glass globe, they render the Pepperlanders immobile as statues by shooting arrows and dropping giant green apples upon them (a reference to the Apple Records music label), and drain the countryside of colour. In the last minute before his capture, Pepperland's elderly Lord Mayor sends Old Fred, an aging sailor (whom the mayor calls \\"Young Fred\\"), to get help; he runs to the Yellow Submarine and takes off in it (\\"Yellow Submarine\\"). Old Fred travels to Liverpool (\\"Eleanor Rigby\\"), where he follows the depressed and aimless Ringo and persuades him to return to Pepperland with him. Ringo collects his \\"mates\\" John, George, and finally Paul in The Pier, a house-like building on the top of a hill. The five journey back to Pepperland in the yellow submarine.

Now a cook for the Oaxaca, Mexico monastery orphanage where he was raised, Ignacio dreams of becoming a luchador, but wrestling is strictly forbidden by the monastery. Ignacio cares deeply for the orphans, but his food is of poor quality because he cannot afford proper ingredients. He also struggles over his feelings for Sister EncarnaciÃ³n, a nun who teaches at the orphanage. One night, while collecting donated tortilla chips for the orphans, Ignacio is robbed of the chips by a street thief named Steven. After a fight between the two, Ignacio decides to disregard the monastery's rules and become a luchador in order to make money.

Ignacio changes his name to \\"Nacho\\" to keep his identity secret, while Steven adopts the name \\"Esqueleto\\" (Skeleton).

My wife and I decided to celebrate our 13th wedding anniversary and treat ourselves to \\"something a bit fancier\\" than the local casinos have to offer. I read the reviews prior to going and still made a conscious decision to take my wife here. Shame on me as I was forewarned. As soon as we arrived, we were greeted by a Hispanic host who was just shuffling people. No greeting, no \\"welcome\\"..no nothing. Just a \\"how many?\\". After paying approx 78 for 2 of us, we were seated in a back corner by a lady who appeared to be from the African continent based by her accent. This seating area ad a really bad stench in the area.

She didn't offer to seat us elsewhere..she just continued on to the next group of people. After being seated we headed to the food counters and found a delightful assortment of food.

In Hamburg, Jarrah had a succession of living accommodations, but he apparently never resided with his future co-conspirators. It is not clear how and when he became part of Atta's circle. He became particularly friendly with Binalshibh after meeting him at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, which Jarrah began attending regularly in late 1997. The worshippers at this mosque featured an outspoken, flamboyant Islamist named Mohammed Haydar Zammar. A well-known figure in the Muslim community (and to German and U.S. intelligence agencies by the late 1990s), Zammar had fought in Afghanistan and relished any opportunity to extol the virtues of violent jihad. Indeed, a witness has reported hearing Zammar press Binalshibh to fulfill his duty to wage jihad. Moreover, after 9/11, Zammar reportedly took credit for influencing not just Binalshibh but the rest of the Hamburg group. In 1998, Zammar encouraged them to participate in jihad and even convinced them to go to Afghanistan. Owing to Zammar's persuasion or some other source of inspiration, Atta, Binalshibh, Shehhi, and Jarrah eventually prepared themselves to translate their extremist beliefs into action. By late 1999, they were ready to abandon their student lives in Germany in favor of violent jihad. This final stage in their evolution toward embracing Islamist extremism did not entirely escape the notice of the people around them. The foursome became core members of a group of radical Muslims, often hosting sessions at their Marienstrasse apartment that involved extremely anti-American discussions. Meeting three to four times a week, the group became something of a \\"sect\\" whose members, according to one participant in the meetings, tended to deal only with each other. Atta's rent checks for the apartment provide evidence of the importance that the apartment assumed as a center for the group, as he would write on them the notation \\"Dar el Ansar,\\" or \\"house of the followers.\\" In addition to Atta, Binalshibh, Shehhi, and Jarrah, the group included other extremists, some of whom also would attend al Qaeda training camps and, in some instances, would help the 9/11 hijackers as they executed the plot: Said Bahaji, son of a Moroccan immigrant, was the only German citizen in the group. Educated in Morocco, Bahaji returned to Germany to study electrical engineering at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg. He spent five months in the German army before obtaining a medical discharge, and lived with Atta and Binalshibh at 54 Marienstrasse for eight months between November 1998 and July 1999.

Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning? pick from the following. 1). Place the watermelon on the flattest side and using a sharp knife press gently into the rind until it slices; 2). Hold the watermelon in your hand and using a blunt knife press firmly into the rind and keep slicing;","completion":"In terms of naive physics reasoning, solution 1 is more sound for cutting into a watermelon rind. Naive physics is our everyday understanding of how objects behave, and reasoning within these concepts would highlight why option 1 is more efficient and safe. Here is a detailed and long explanation of why solution 1 is better: 1. Safety: By placing the watermelon on the flattest side, it provides stability and minimizes the risk of slipping or rolling while trying to cut through the rind. As watermelons have an irregular, oval shape, this is crucial in preventing any accidental slips or cuts. 2. Surface Area: Having the watermelon on a flat surface allows for better control over the knife and the pressure being utilized. When you hold the watermelon in your hand, as in option 2, you must balance it while also holding the knife, which can lead to uneven or jagged cuts, increasing the probability of accidents. 3. Sharpness of the knife: Solution 1 suggests using a sharp knife, which is ideal for cutting into watermelon rinds due to less required force which, in turn, reduces the risk of accidents. The sharp edge easily pierces through the harder layers of the rind, allowing for smooth, clean cuts. A blunt knife, as in option 2, would require significantly more force and effort to penetrate the rind, increasing the possibility of a slip or mishandling, causing injury. 4. Control and efficiency: Using gentle pressure, as recommended in solution 1, allows for better control and precision. This technique helps ensure that the rind is cut slowly but surely, reducing the risk of a mistake. In solution 2, pressing firmly into the rind may cause the blade to slip, or apply uneven pressure on the rind, leading to jagged cuts or gouges in the watermelon flesh, or a reduced ability to follow a desired path. 5. Quality of cuts: Solution 1's methods result in clean, precise cuts, which are essential for presentation purposes and ease of consumption. With a stable cutting surface and a sharp knife, this approach produces more aesthetically pleasing and even slices, ensuring that every bit of the watermelon can be savored. In conclusion, following naive physics reasoning, solution 1 is the more effective and safe way to cut into a watermelon rind. By placing the watermelon on its flattest side, using a sharp knife, and pressing gently, you will achieve better control over the cutting process, reduce the risk of accidents, and create an optimal presentation for your fruit."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

When the river boat returns, it brings Donald Nordley (Donald Sinden) and his wife Linda (Grace Kelly). The Nordleys wish to go on safari to film gorillas. Marswell declines to guide them. Honey Bear rejoins the group after the steamer runs aground. Tensions run high between the two women when Linda is also attracted to Marswell. Marswell agrees to take the Nordleys into gorilla country, taking Honey Bear halfway to join the District Commissioner, who can then escort her back to civilization. However, they find the commissioner badly wounded by recently belligerent natives. With reinforcements days away, the small party narrowly escapes, taking the mortally wounded commissioner with them.

The new Governor, Sir Richard (Cecil Parker), arrives with his charming and cheery but indolent nephew, the Honorable Charles Adare (Michael Wilding). Charles, who is hoping to make his fortune, is befriended by gruff Samson Flusky (Joseph Cotten), a prosperous businessman who was previously a transported convict, apparently a murderer. Sam says that because he has bought the legal limit of land, he wants Charles to buy land and then sell it to him for a profit so that Sam can accumulate more frontier territory. Though the Governor orders him not to go, Charles is invited to dinner at Sam's house. Charles discovers that he already knows Sam's wife, Lady Henrietta (Ingrid Bergman), an aristocrat who was a good friend of Charles' sister when they were all children in Ireland. Lady Henrietta is now a alcoholic who is socially shunned. Sam invites Charles to stay at his house, hoping it will cheer up his wife, who is on the verge of madness. The housekeeper, Milly (Margaret Leighton), has completely taken over the running the household, and is the one who secretly feeds Lady Henrietta alcohol, hoping to destroy her and win Sam's affections. Gradually, Charles restores Henrietta's self-confidence. They become closer and closer, and eventually they share a passionate kiss. But Henrietta explains that she and Sam are bound together most profoundly: when she was young, Sam was the handsome stable boy. Overcome with desire, they ran away and married at Gretna Green. Henrietta's brother, furious that aristocratic Henrietta had paired up with a lowly servant, confronted them. Her brother shot at them and missed; she then shot her brother fatally.

Simon Buckden, 44, from Leeds, received donations including a £2,000 holiday after lying about his condition. He also falsely claimed to have served in the SAS and seen active duty in Bosnia and Northern Ireland. He was sentenced at Leeds Crown Court having pleaded guilty to six counts of fraud midway through his trial. For live updates and more from across West Yorkshire Buckden described traumatic experiences from his fabricated career, including holding a dying child in his arms, and claimed he suffered with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a result. But jurors heard Buckden was a military clerk who had carried out one overseas deployment to Bosnia but had never experienced front line active service. He claimed he had been diagnosed with rectal cancer midway through a challenge to run 100 marathons in 100 weeks to raise awareness of PTSD. Judge Christopher Batty told Buckden: \\"You are a dishonest and manipulative man. \\"Over a period from at least 2009, you developed a fictitious persona, a dishonest life history in order to advance your own prospects in life. \\"The disrespect you have shown to those who have suffered cancer and to those who have lost their battle with it is quite breathtaking.\\" At one stage during the challenge he ran from Leeds to Westminster, receiving the praise of former Prime Minister David Cameron.

I found the following answer on Google: An exemplar animation of a pendulum showing the velocity and acceleration vectors Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","completion":"No, the information given does not correctly answer the question. The pendulum did improve upon earlier clocks, but your mention of an animation and velocity and acceleration vectors doesn't provide an explanation of how the improvement occurred. Here is a detailed answer: The key improvement made by the integration of a pendulum into clocks was increased accuracy when telling time. Early mechanical clocks relied primarily on an escapement mechanism, which can be understood as a form of mechanical 'brakes'. This system was used to control the speed in which gears and sprockets, powered by a driving weight, would turn to advance the hands of the clock. However, these early systems had many limitations, mainly because they were influenced by a lot of extrinsic variables like changes in friction, air pressure, temperature, and even the gradual lowering of the drive weight that powers the clock. These all influenced the speed at which the clock would run, making them susceptible to losing or gaining time. The innovation of incorporating a pendulum into clock design occurred in the 17th century. The Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens is typically credited with this development. The pendulum's importance lied in its unique properties. A free-swinging pendulum follows a predictable pattern based on the physical properties of pendulum motion. Given an unchanging length and gravity, a pendulum will always take the same amount of time to complete one swing, or oscillation, regardless of the distance it travels. This is known as isochronism. Huygens discovered this principle and thus, by integrating a pendulum into clock design, it was possible to control the escapement mechanism more accurately. The oscillations of the pendulum controlled when the next gear tooth was released. So, as long as the pendulum was undisturbed and the length unchanged, the clock would keep accurate time. The pendulum improved the accuracy of clocks dramatically and was the gold standard in control mechanisms for clocks for around 300 years. It wasn't until the advent of quartz crystal oscillators in the 20th century that a more accurate method of timekeeping was developed. However, pendulum clocks are still in use today due to their historical charm and interesting mechanical design, even though they are not as accurate as more modern methods of timekeeping."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

We suspect that because of the crowds, normally excellent restaurants are churning out sub-par food for above average prices. Primi Piatti bucks that trend. Desperate for high quality food, we ventured away from the city center and explored the beautiful St. Lambert neighborhood. After a few positive reviews on Yelp we decided to try Primi Piatti. We did not have a reservation, nor, embarassingly, were we properly attired, however the host Pino took pity and seated us in the outside patio area. A quick review of the wine list revealed true taste and selection went into putting it together. While some wines that americans are accustomed to having inexpensively are a bit pricey due to import taxes, there are a number of excellent bottles under 50. We selected the Cellar 8 Cab Sav. for 30. The bottle was brought along with glasses proper to the wine. A quick look around and I saw that every wine was being served in the glasses appropriate for that wine. I also observed that most of the \\"newer\\" (2006 and up) vintage old world wines were poured through an aerator.

His tone was calm, but his eyes held a storm of emotions: anticipation, affection, desire. Katricia inhaled sharply at his touch - a combination of nerves and desire. Fear wasn't exactly what she was feeling; it was more of a rush of anticipation, mixed with a sense of novelty. The atmosphere was thickening with a kind of intensity that was new and intimidating, yet undeniably intriguing. She met his gaze, her eyes filled with apprehension, but also the budding curiosity of a woman beginning to explore the hidden corners of her own desires. His question was met with silence for a moment as she searched for the right words. When she finally spoke, her voice was barely more than a whisper, laden with expectation - a silent plea for him not to cease his explorations. \\"I'm not scared... I'm just... overwhelmed,\\" she confessed, a rosy blush spreading across her porcelain cheeks. Her heart hammered against her chest, as if it too echoed her confession. \\"Overwhelmed...\\" Teddy echoed, running his thumb gently over her blossoming blush. His eyes softened in understanding, his touch lingering slightly on her heated cheeks. \\"That's perfectly normal, Katricia,\\" he soothed. His lips tilted in a comforting smile that served to soften the tension knotted in the pit of her stomach. He let a silence stretch between them, a silence filled with her unsteady breaths and the rhythmical pounding of her heart. He was patient and understanding, wanting her to find comfort within this unexplored realm of her desires. An unspoken promise hung in the air between them - a promise that every next move was hers to decide, every next touch, every next kiss. And with that assurance encased in his silent promise, the room somehow felt a little less overwhelming, the intensity of the sensations less intimidating. Katricia, under his tender care, was stepping into the irresistible allure of new experiences. Shrouded in anticipation and the comforting warmth of Teddy's presence, she felt an empowering acceptance of her desires, a sense of readiness to explore the ecstasy of shared intimacy. It was a transformative moment for Katricia, a beautifully intimate transition from apprehensive naivety to explorative curiosity. Teddy was her safe harbor in this storm of sensations, guiding her through, allowing her to embrace her desires, and in doing so, offering her an enriching understanding of not just her physical responses but also her emotional ones, thereby deepening the connection between them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I didn’t particularly love it but it was interesting enough at the least to hold my attention. We got to class and the teacher pulled up a list of instructions on the projector. She had each of us follow the instructions and she gave us 20 minutes to complete all of them. It may even have been a bit of a race too, to see who finished it first. This becomes a lot more evident in a second. I can’t recall the exact details of the instructions, except that clearly it had to do with art such as having to draw a bunch of things. Anyways, we all went one by one down the instructions getting increasing nervous as to try to be the first one to finish. The class goes quiet while we work. Then I get to the last instruction which reads something along the lines of: “Step 15: Skip steps 1–14 and put your pencil down.” You gotta be freaking kidding me. We’re all so confused and mad at ourselves for not reading the whole of the instructions first. She turned this into a lesson for how we need to learn to read all the instructions first and then start, which was pretty clever. She got us! I remember this vividly to this day. But I look back now on this “prank” and I realize that she was kind of…wrong. Sure if the instructions are short like 15 steps it might be good to glance through before you start. But what about a whole load of instructions? Who the hell is going to read through the instructions for how to build their Death Star LEGO set before even starting to build it.

Q: Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'.

I asked him about the most vivid memory of his life. One morning, as he was heading towards his office, he realized that the road he regularly takes was unusually bumpy. Upon inspection, he came to the conclusion that a truck carrying stones passed by on that road and unintentionally scattered few stones along the way. He believed that the authority of the truck will take care of this later that day. Next morning, the road situation was unchanged with stones still scattered. He parked his vehicle nearby, put on some music and started kicking the stones off the road. Within a few minutes, a school bus stopped by, students gathered around and started clapping for this true Indian. As he turned around, he said “Helping hands are better than clapping hands”. As a repercussion, the students started helping this man kick the stones off the road. A task that would have taken hours to be done by one person was completed in a couple of minutes. What a great example of team work! It was this man’s discretionary efforts that brought a change in the thought process of the students, India’s next generation. We all point fingers and blame one another for societal problems but never act upon it. If this man, a true Indian, would have just blammed the truck driver and went on his way, would the road still be cleared? The next time we point fingers at someone for a social cause, we must keep in mind that that someone is an Indian just like us. Will a true Indian point fingers at an Indian?

Question: Question: \\"What properties of the how the upper zone of a glacier moves contribute to a crack forming?\\" Context: \\"The top 50 m (160 ft) of a glacier are rigid because they are under low pressure. This upper section is known as the fracture zone and moves mostly as a single unit over the plastically flowing lower section. When a glacier moves through irregular terrain, cracks called crevasses develop in the fracture zone. Crevasses form due to differences in glacier velocity. If two rigid sections of a glacier move at different speeds and directions, shear forces cause them to break apart, opening a crevasse. Crevasses are seldom more than 46 m (150 ft) deep but in some cases can be 300 m (1,000 ft) or even deeper. Beneath this point, the plasticity of the ice is too great for cracks to form. Intersecting crevasses can create isolated peaks in the ice, called seracs.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"The properties of the upper zone of a glacier that contribute to crack formation include its rigidity, low pressure, and movement as a single unit over the plastically flowing lower section.

Charles Michael \\"Chuck\\" Schuldiner (May 13, 1967 - December 13, 2001) was an American singer, songwriter, and guitarist. He founded the pioneering band Death in 1983. Schuldiner is often referred to as \\"The Godfather of death metal\\", and his obituary in the January 5, 2002 issue of UK's Kerrang! magazine said that \\"Chuck Schuldiner was one of the most significant figures in the history of metal.\\" Schuldiner formed Death as Mantas in 1983 when he was just 16 years old. Original members were Schuldiner (guitar), Rick Rozz (guitar) and Kam Lee (drums and vocals). In January 1986, Schuldiner moved to Toronto and temporarily joined the Canadian band Slaughter. However, he quickly returned to continue the formation of Death. Death underwent many lineup changes. With Chris Reifert, Schuldiner eventually released the first Death album, titled Scream Bloody Gore, in 1987. He continued with 1988's Leprosy with the line-up of former Mantas guitarist Rick Rozz and rhythm section Terry Butler on bass and Bill Andrews on drums, and 1990's Spiritual Healing, where guitarist James Murphy had replaced the fired Rozz in 1989. After Spiritual Healing, Schuldiner stopped working with full-time band members, preferring to work with studio and live venue musicians, due to bad relationships with Death's previous rhythm section and guitarists. This earned Schuldiner something of a 'perfectionist' reputation in the metal community. Schuldiner had also fired his manager Eric Greif but settled and re-hired him before the recording of his next, influential release. Death's breakthrough album, Human saw the band evolving to a more technical and progressive style, in which Schuldiner displayed his guitar skills more than ever. He continued in this style (and continued the success of the band) with 1993's Individual Thought Patterns, 1995's Symbolic, and finally The Sound of Perseverance in 1998. Throughout his career, Schuldiner was not afraid to take on controversial lyrical subjects, taking an anti-drug stance on \\"Living Monstrosity\\" and writing about abortion in \\"Altering the Future\\". He put Death on hold after this to continue Control Denied, which he had been putting together prior to the release of The Sound of Perseverance, and released The Fragile Art of Existence in 1999. Control Denied also had other players from the latest Death album but featured a melodic metal vocalist. Schuldiner also played guitar in the \\"supergroup\\" Voodoocult on the album Jesus Killing Machine in 1994 and played a guest solo on Naphobia's 1995 release, Of Hell on the track \\"As Ancients Evolve\\" as a favor to the band's bassist at the time who was a friend of Schuldiner's. Schuldiner was also asked to be one of the many guest vocalists on Dave Grohl's 2001 Probot. Grohl, Napalm Death, Ozzy Osbourne, and Anthrax all increased efforts to raise funds for Schuldiner's medical bills with Grohl trying to involve Schuldiner on an album he was working on. In a 1999 interview Schuldiner spoke about why he didn't sing on the album The Fragile Art of Existence \\"...these vocals are all I ever wanted to do in Death but couldn't. I've had this dream of recording like that for years, and it seems like a dream come true. Tim Aymar is an amazing singer and this is the main difference. I think people will be surprised at the violence and strength of the album. Many people are expecting something like Iron Maiden, but, despite being one of my favorite bands, I didn't want to make an Iron Maiden-like album. I wanted to make an unpredictable album, just like I did in Death, I guess.

When most people think of air pollution, they think of the pollution outdoors. But it is just as easy to have indoor air pollution. Your home or school classroom probably doesn't get much fresh air. Sealing up your home reduces heating and cooling costs. But this also causes air pollution to stay trapped indoors. And people today usually spend a majority of their time indoors. So exposure to indoor air pollution can become a significant health risk. What is an answer for this question: Which friend was exposed to less outdoor pollution? Answer:","completion":"Based on the given background information and the situation described, it is clear that both Patty and Fay lived in an area with moderate to high levels of air pollution. However, their exposure to outdoor pollution varied due to their respective lifestyles and habits. Patty, being a runner and hiking enthusiast, spent a lot of her time outdoors engaging in physical activities. During these outdoor activities, she would naturally have higher exposure to the outdoor air pollution present in her environment. Activities like running and hiking require increased respiration rates, which would mean that Patty would inhale more polluted air when exercising outside. Therefore, her exposure to outdoor pollution would be significantly higher as she spent a substantial amount of time engaging in outdoor activities. On the other hand, Fay appeared to spend most of her time indoors, having sealed up her home to conserve energy and reduce heating and cooling costs. By doing so, she limited her contact with the outdoor air, effectively reducing her exposure to outdoor air pollution. However, it is important to note that sealing up her home could contribute to increased levels of indoor air pollution, as described in the background information. The trapped indoor air, combined with various sources of indoor pollutants like cleaning supplies, cooking fumes, and personal care products, may exacerbate the indoor air pollution levels. As such, it can be concluded that, between the two friends, Fay was exposed to less outdoor pollution due to her preference for spending most of her time indoors. This does not necessarily mean that her overall exposure to air pollution was less than Patty's, as indoor air pollution may present a significant health risk as well. Both friends should take preventive measures to minimize exposure to air pollution, such as using air purifiers, ventilating indoor spaces properly, and staying informed about local air quality levels."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The context states that Destiny is a French-Egyptian historical drama film, which highlights the multinational nature of its production. While France was involved in the film's creation, it is not explicitly mentioned that it was solely presented as the representative of France at the festival. 2. The context also specifies that the film \\"was screened out of competition at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival.\\" This implies that Destiny was not officially considered for any awards at the film festival and thus could not represent France in any sort of competitive aspect during the event. 3. Furthermore, the passage states that \\"The film was selected as the Egyptian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 70th Academy Awards,\\" which adds weight to the film's Egyptian connection and accentuates its multinational status. However, it does not provide any information on the film being the official French entry for any event or festival. In conclusion, given the limited information provided in the context, we cannot confidently conclude that Destiny was the French entry at the Cannes Film Festival.

Information: - Strawberry latent ringspot virus ( SLRSV ) is a plant pathogenic virus in an Unassigned family . Its entry in the ICTV database indicates this virus is a Sadwavirus but current literature indicates that it may be a Cheravirus . - Juice is a beverage made from the extraction or pressing out of the natural liquid contained in fruit and vegetables. It can also refer to liquids that are flavored with these or other biological food sources such as meat and seafood (e.g., clam juice). Juice is commonly consumed as a beverage or used as an ingredient or flavoring in foods or other beverages, such as smoothies. Juice emerged as a popular beverage choice after the development of pasteurization methods allowed for its preservation without using fermentation (the approach used with wine production). The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) estimated the total world production of citrus fruit juices to be 12,840,318 tonnes in 2012. The largest fruit juice consumers are New Zealand (nearly a cup, or 8 ounces, each day) and Colombia (more than three quarters of a cup each day). Fruit juice consumption on average increased with country income level. - In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) formed from the ovary after flowering. - The Picornavirales are an order of viruses with vertebrate, insect, and plant hosts. This group consists of viruses which have positive-sense single-stranded RNA genomes. - Cheravirus is a genus of viruses in the order Picornavirales, in the family Secoviridae. Plants serve as natural hosts. There are currently four species in this genus including the type species Cherry rasp leaf virus. - An accessory fruit (sometimes called \\"false fruit\\", \\"spurious fruit\\", \\"pseudofruit\\", or \\"pseudocarp\\") is a fruit in which some of the flesh is derived not from the ovary but from some adjacent tissue exterior to the carpel. Examples of accessory tissue are the receptacle of the strawberry, pineapple, common fig, and mulberry, and the calyx of \\"Gaultheria procumbens\\" or \\"Syzygium jambos\\". Pomes, such as apples and pears, are also accessory fruits, with much of the fruit flesh derived from a hypanthium. Other example could be the \\"anthocarps\\" specific to the family Nyctaginaceae, where most of the fruit comes from the perianth (floral whorls). - \\"Perfume\\" is a mixture of fragrant essential oils or aroma compounds, fixatives and solvents - used to give the human body, animals, food, objects, and living-spaces \\"a pleasant scent\\". - Cherry rasp leaf virus (CRLV) is a plant pathogenic virus of the order Picornavirales, family Secoviridae, subfamily Comovirinae, genus Cheravirus. - The garden strawberry (or simply strawberry; Fragaria × ananassa) is a widely grown hybrid species of the genus \\"Fragaria\\" (collectively known as the strawberries). It is cultivated worldwide for its fruit. The fruit (which is not a botanical berry, but an aggregate accessory fruit) is widely appreciated for its characteristic aroma, bright red color, juicy texture, and sweetness. It is consumed in large quantities, either fresh or in such prepared foods as preserves, fruit juice, pies, ice creams, milkshakes, and chocolates. Artificial strawberry flavorings and aromas are also widely used in many products like lip gloss, candy, hand sanitizers, perfume, and many others. - Secoviridae is a family of viruses in the order Picornavirales. Plants serve as natural hosts. There are currently 73 species in this family, divided among 11 genera. - Chocolate is a typically sweet, usually brown food preparation of \\"Theobroma cacao\\" seeds, roasted and ground, and often flavored with vanilla. It is made in the form of a liquid, paste, or in a block, or used as a flavoring ingredient in other foods. Cacao has been cultivated by many cultures for at least three millennia in Mesoamerica. The earliest evidence of use traces to the Mokaya (Mexico and Guatemala), with evidence of chocolate beverages dating back to 1900 BCE. In fact, the majority of Mesoamerican people made chocolate beverages, including the Maya and Aztecs, who made it into a beverage known as \\"xocoltl\\" , a Nahuatl word meaning \\"bitter water\\". The seeds of the cacao tree have an intense bitter taste and must be fermented to develop the flavor. - Sadwavirus is a genus of viruses in the order Picornavirales, in the family Secoviridae. Plants (specifically Satsuma mandarin trees) serve as natural hosts. There is currently only one species in this genus: the type species \\"Satsuma dwarf virus\\". Diseases associated with this genus include: satsuma dwarf virus disease which causes spoon-shaped leaves on citrus tree. Symptoms are enations, multiple flushing, stunting or dwarfing, reduction in number and size of leaves and fruits. The name of this genus comes from its type species: Satsuma dwarf virus. - Fragaria is a genus of flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae, commonly known as strawberries for their edible fruits. There are more than 20 described species and many hybrids and cultivars. The most common strawberries grown commercially are cultivars of the garden strawberry, a hybrid known as \\"Fragaria\\" × \\"ananassa\\". Strawberries have a taste that varies by cultivar, and ranges from quite sweet to rather tart. Strawberries are an important commercial fruit crop, widely grown in all temperate regions of the world.

Write a title for this article: If It Happened in Baltimore, Maybe It Can Happen Anywhere For a few weeks in the summer of 1995, Jen Kern spent her days at a table in the Library of Congress in Washington, poring over the fine print of state constitutions from around the country. This was, at the time, a somewhat-eccentric strategy to fight poverty in America. Kern was not a high-powered lawyer or politician; she was 25 and held a low-paying, policy-related job at Acorn, the national community organization. Yet to understand why living-wage campaigns matter - where they began, what they mean and why they inspire such passion and hope - it helps to consider what Kern was doing years ago in the library, reading obscure legislation from states like Missouri and New Mexico. A few months earlier, she and her colleagues at Acorn witnessed an energetic grass-roots campaign in Baltimore, led by a coalition of church groups and labor unions. Workers in some of Baltimore's homeless shelters and soup kitchens had noticed something new and troubling about many of the visitors coming in for meals and shelter: they happened to have full-time jobs. In response, local religious leaders successfully persuaded the City Council to raise the base pay for city contract workers to 6.10 an hour from 4.25, the federal minimum at the time. The Baltimore campaign was ostensibly about money. But to those who thought about it more deeply, it was about the force of particular moral propositions: first, that work should be rewarded, and second, that no one who works full time should have to live in poverty. So Kern and another colleague were dispatched to find out if what happened in Baltimore could be tried - and expanded - elsewhere. As she plowed through documents, Kern was unsure whether to look for a particular law or the absence of one. Really, what she was trying to do was compile a list of places in the U.S. where citizens or officials could legally mount campaigns to raise the minimum wage above the federal standard. In other words, she needed to know if anything stood in the way, like a state regulation or a court decision. What she discovered was that in many states a law more ambitious than Baltimore's - one that didn't apply to only city contractors but to all local businesses - seemed permissible. Whether a wage campaign was winnable turned out to be a more complicated matter. In the late 90's, Kern helped Acorn in a series of attempts to raise the minimum wage in Denver and Houston, as well as the state of Missouri. They all failed. \\"It wasn't even close,\\" she says. In the past few years, though, as the federal minimum wage has remained fixed at 5.15 and the cost of living (specifically housing) has risen drastically in many regions, similar campaigns have produced so many victories (currently, 134) that Kern speaks collectively of \\"a widespread living-wage movement.\\" Santa Fe has been one of the movement's crowning achievements. This month the city's minimum wage rose to 9.50 an hour, the highest rate in the United States. But other recent victories include San Francisco in 2003 and Nevada in 2004. And if a pending bill in Chicago is any indication, the battles over wage laws will soon evolve into campaigns to force large, private-sector businesses like Wal-Mart to provide not only higher wages but also more money for employee health care. It is a common sentiment that economic fairness - or economic justice, as living-wage advocates phrase it - should, or must, come in a sweeping and righteous gesture from the top. From Washington, that is. But most wage campaigns arise from the bottom, from residents and low-level officials and from cities and states - from everywhere except the federal government. \\"I think what the living-wage movement has done in the past 11 years is incredible,\\" David Neumark, a frequent critic of the phenomenon who is a senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California, told me recently. \\"How many other issues are there where progressives have been this successful? I can't think of one.\\" Jon Gertner is a contributing writer for the magazine.Correction: Feb. 5, 2006, Sunday: An article on Jan. 15 about Santa Fe and the minimum wage misstated the percentage of teenagers among workers in the country who make less than 7.25 an hour. It is 28 percent, not 35. The article also referred imprecisely to the origin of the Santa Fe ordinance that increased the minimum wage for city workers.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the person who picked which version of the text to reprint?, using the article: The \\"magnificent and accurate\\" Shakespeare edition which Boydell began in 1786 was to be the focus of his enterprise—he viewed the print folio and the gallery as offshoots of the main project. In an advertisement prefacing the first volume of the edition, Nicol wrote that \\"splendor and magnificence, united with correctness of text were the great objects of this Edition\\". The volumes themselves were handsome, with gilded pages that, unlike those in previous scholarly editions, were unencumbered by footnotes. Each play had its own title page followed by a list of \\"Persons in the Drama\\". Boydell spared no expense. He hired the typography experts William Bulmer and William Martin to develop and cut a new typeface specifically for the edition. Nicol explains in the preface that they \\"established a printing-house ... [and] a foundry to cast the types; and even a manufactory to make the ink\\". Boydell also chose to use high-quality wove Whatman paper. The illustrations were printed independently and could be inserted and removed as the purchaser desired. The first volumes of the Dramatic Works were published in 1791 and the last in 1805. Boydell was responsible for the \\"splendor\\", and George Steevens, the general editor, was responsible for the \\"correctness of text\\". Steevens, according to Evelyn Wenner, who has studied the history of the Boydell edition, was \\"at first an ardent advocate of the plan\\" but \\"soon realized that the editor of this text must in the very scheme of things give way to painters, publishers and engravers\\". He was also ultimately disappointed in the quality of the prints, but he said nothing to jeopardize the edition's sales. Steevens, who had already edited two complete Shakespeare editions, was not asked to edit the text anew; instead, he picked which version of the text to reprint.

Choose from: a. take the dog to the pound b. buy a dog whistle to train it c. correct the dog with a newspaper Given those answer options, answer the question: I heard that Ash has a new dog and it was playful but would not listen, so he had to call the dog often. And I was wondering What will Ash want to do next? A:","completion":"Ash will most likely consider option B: buying a dog whistle to train it. This choice is the most reasonable and appropriate based on the details provided. It is important to note that owning a dog comes with responsibilities, one of which is to ensure proper training for the pet. Training is essential to manage the dog's behavior, instill discipline, and establish a good owner-pet relationship. A dog whistle, in this context, is a highly useful tool for training. It produces a sound at a frequency which dogs can hear but is outside the range of human hearing. It's used by trainers worldwide to get the attention of their dogs, especially when they are at a distance. When Ash's dog hears the whistle, it will start associating the sound with desired responses or actions, such as coming when called. This is based on a concept known as \\"classical conditioning,\\" a type of associative learning that was first demonstrated by Ivan Pavlov. Training with a dog whistle involves a series of steps. First, Ash would need to help his dog associate the sound of the whistle with pleasant experiences, such as having meals or receiving treats. Ash would blow the whistle just before presenting the dog with its meal or reward, so that it forms a positive association with the sound. Once this association is established, Ash can start using the whistle to summon the dog. Whenever the dog comes in response to the whistle, Ash should provide a reward to reinforce the behavior. Importantly, using a dog whistle encourages the dog to focus on its owner, which can help Ash manage his playful but somewhat disobedient new pet. The whistle sound can cut through distractions, allowing the dog to focus its attention on Ash. This extra level of control can make a difference when trying to get a dog to listen, especially one that's new and playful like Ash's. Opting for the dog whistle doesn't only represent a commitment to the dog's well-being but also sets the foundation for a stronger bond between Ash and his new pet. It demonstrates Ash's intention to work with the dog to improve its behavior rather than resorting to more drastic or punitive measures. The other options - A (taking the dog to the pound) or C (correcting the dog with a newspaper) - don't seem as suitable in this context. Ash just got his new dog, and despite the dog's unresponsive behavior, it's too early to consider taking it to the pound. Moreover, adopting a pet involves assuming responsibility for their upbringing, as dogs in their new environment would need time to adapt. As for option C, using negative reinforcement such as hitting the dog with a newspaper is generally frowned upon in the modern world of animal psychology. Such training tactics can lead to fear and anxiety, impacting the dog's emotional well-being and influencing it to show aggressive behaviors in response. Positive reinforcement like praise, treats, or toys are, hence, more recommended while training dogs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The mighty fane, with its three massive towers, rises majestically over the red roofs of the town. Its most striking feature is the great Norman screen, running up without buttresses or projections to the parapet and hiding the bases of the square, richly decorated towers of the west front. The plain centre of the screen is the work of Remigius, the first bishop. The rest of it is relieved with rich arcading of Late Norman and Early English periods. The wooden spires which crowned the towers were removed in 1807. In 1192 Hugh of Avalon determined to rebuild the Norman building of Remigius, which an earthquake had shaken. To him we owe the choir and eastern transept. His successors completed the western transept and began the west end of the nave. So much money had to be spent in rebuilding the central tower, which fell in 1239, that the canons could not rebuild the nave entirely, but had to incorporate the Norman end by Remigius. Unfortunately the axis of the west front does not correspond to that of the nave, which is too wide for its height. The low vaulting is a serious defect in the choir built by St. Hugh, but of the superb beauty of the Angel Choir, which encloses his shrine, there can be no doubt. In its richness of sculpture it is one of the masterpieces of Gothic architecture in England. The interior of the cathedral is remarkable for the harmony of its style, which is Lancet-Gothic, and the dim lighting of the nave only adds to its impressiveness.

Answer:","completion":"It became publicly known in 2015 that the 67th United States Secretary of State, Hillary Rodham Clinton, had used her family's private email server for official communications during her tenure, which was from 2009 to 2013. The discovery of this practice raised concerns about the security and preservation of government records, as well as transparency and compliance with federal regulations. The issue came to light on March 2, 2015, when The New York Times reported that Clinton had exclusively used a personal email account instead of a government-issued one during her time as Secretary of State. The controversy quickly gained momentum, leading to congressional investigations and an FBI inquiry. Further information about Clinton's email practices was revealed in the following months. It was discovered that her private server, located in her home in Chappaqua, New York, had not been approved by the State Department, and that some of the emails she sent and received contained classified information. Consequently, this raised concerns about potential security breaches and the possibility of sensitive information falling into the wrong hands. Clinton's use of a private email server and the subsequent investigations became a significant issue in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, in which she was the Democratic nominee. The controversy attracted widespread media attention and contributed to a heated debate about government transparency and the handling of sensitive information. In summary, it was in 2015 that the public became aware of the 67th United States Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server for official communications.

The amount of friction depends on the type of materials in contact and the smoothness or roughness of their surfaces. A plastic computer lid is typically smooth, and therefore, has less friction. That's why the paper towel roll moves more easily on it. On the other hand, a couch cushion is usually made of fabric, which has a rougher texture, and therefore more friction.

Of these qualities one of the most important is sympathy-fellow-feeling. If a man had no fellow-feeling, we should call him \\"inhuman\\"; he would be no true man. We think so much of this quality that we call a kind man \\"human\\"-that is, man-like in his conduct, first to other men, and afterwards to all living things. If you are cruel to animals, you are not likely to be kind or thoughtfull to men; and if you are thoughtful towards men, you are not likely to be cruel and thoughtful towards animals. This is why the wise man of old wrote, \\"The merciful man is merciful to his beast.\\" What a pleasure it is also to be loved by our pets or domestic animals; and to feel that we are caring for them and are deserving of their love; or to watch the ways of wild creatures, and gradually to make friends with them! Treating animals kindly does not mean that we must never inflict any pain on them. We ourselves are trained by pains as well as by pleasures; so too, punishment is sometimes needed to train our dogs and horses to obey us. We endure pains at the hands of the surgeon, to cure some wound or to heal some disease; so too, animals must submit to being doctored. We send out our bravest men to face wounds, sickness and death, for the good of the nation; so too, we let our horses share the risk of battle. For similar reasons, we cannot hesitate to destroy dangerous creatures like wolves and show senseless ferocity . It is no excuse to say that these animals deserve to be treated cruelly on account of their own cruelty.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please briefly summarize this news article: Swimming pools, gas money and other expenses you didn’t know could be tax breaks If you started working on your tax return, you probably know to write off your mortgage interest and the check you wrote to the food bank. But what about your pet food or the swimming pool you bought last year? When it comes to the tax code, most rules are rigid and specific. But the IRS allows for some wiggle room when it comes to medical deductions and business expenses. It’s what has allowed people in unique situations to write off landscaping, tanning oil and even breast augmentation surgery. The catch is that the tax breaks depend heavily on each person’s unique circumstances. Treating a health condition is far from an exact science. And what could be a leisure purchase for one taxpayer may be a legitimate business expense for another. But that also means that taxpayers claiming a unique expense need to be ready to back up their write-off. Some of the taxpayers who have been successful with claiming more creative tax breaks have had to make their case in tax court. Still, taxpayers who spent a lot of money and energy researching and treating health issues, or who are writing off business expenses should take the time to make sure they’re writing off everything they can, accountants say. “Sometimes the rules are not black and white,” says Melissa Labant, director of tax advocacy for the American Institute of CPAs. “A particular expenditure may be deductible for one business but not another.” Here are some expenses you may not realize could lead to a tax break: Gas money. Taxpayers claiming the medical deduction can write off transportation costs for getting to and from doctor’s visits and other medical appointments. Of course, gas money alone won’t be enough to help them qualify for the tax break. Total medical expenses have to be greater than 10 percent of a person’s adjusted gross income, or greater than 7.5 percent if the person, or his or her spouse, is at least 65 years old. So people who already spent a substantial amount of money on surgery, exams and other treatment should make sure to include the cost of the gas, tolls and parking they needed to get to and from those appointments when filing for the tax break. Gas money or mileage and other travel expenses can also be deducted for business trips and for people who move beyond a certain distance for a new job, but aren’t reimbursed for moving expenses. Swimming pool. In rare cases, people who need a swimming pool for health reasons, say for physical therapy to help treat a chronic pain condition, may be able to write off the cost of the pool as a medical expense. But the write-off won’t come easy. Taxpayers may also have to show that the pool is not being used for any other purpose, Labant says, a feat that may be difficult when kids or grandkids are also splashing around in the pool. Some people may have to prove that it is too inconvenient for them to access a pool anywhere else, either because of distance or because of the severity of their condition, she adds. Home improvements. While most people won’t write off swimming pools, other home improvements, including the installation of hand rails, ramps or elevators may also be deductible if they are made for medical reasons. Taxpayers should keep in mind, though, that the deduction would be offset by any value the change adds to a person’s home. So say a homeowner spent 15,000 on an elevator and a property appraiser estimates that it increased the value of the house by 10,000. He or she would be able to write off 5,000 of the expense as a medical deduction. If the improvement doesn’t lead to any increase in property value, the entire expense is deductible. Conference costs. People who attended a medical conference to learn more about the ways to treat a condition affecting them, a spouse or a child may be able to write off the transportation costs and attendance fees as a medical expense. Most of the time at the conference must be spent attending sessions focused on medical information. Rent. Don’t celebrate just yet. The rent you pay is only deductible if it’s for a business. If you’re a renter who works from home, you may be able to deduct only part of your rent, according to the IRS. And even then, you need to meet the stringent rules for making business use of a home. That includes a requirement that the relevant section of your home be used only for business. (If your home office also doubles as your guest room, you may need to count it out.) Landscaping. Small business owners with a home office may be able to write off certain cosmetic improvements such as landscaping, lawn care and driveway repairs. One self-employed man who met most of his clients at home had success writing off part of his landscaping costs in 2001, leading to deduction of more than 11,000, when he showed that the section of his property receiving the improvements was used primarily for business. Pet food. In another rare case, the owners of a junk yard wrote off 300 in cat food. The taxpayers explained in tax court that they brought wild cats on to the property to help scare off snakes and rats. Therefore, the food needed to feed the cats was found to be a legitimate business expense. Most people will have a hard time meeting such particular circumstances, but the 2001 case could inspire some taxpayers to think creatively about their business expenses. These tax write-offs may not be a good fit for you, but the examples may be a reminder to make sure to give your tax return a close look. If you aren’t sure if something qualifies, check with the IRS or seek help from a tax pro. “Don’t assume something is nondeductible because you enjoy it,” Labant says.

Therefore, the larger and healthier mushrooms have no direct influence in the process of butterfly growth. However, in the second part of the question, it is asked to investigate the less number of butterflies.

Article:Judges ruled that a decision to first manage major disruption then later bring charges against offenders was well within the police's discretion. They also found proportionate steps had been taken to protect the human rights of nationalist residents potentially exposed to the weekly demonstrations. In April, a High Court judge said police had not understood their powers. The verdict was related to weekly processions from east Belfast into the city centre during December 2012 and January 2013. Demonstrations were staged in response to the decision to restrict the flying of the union flag at Belfast City Hall to designated days only. It had previously been flown all year round. A man, identified only as DB, who lives in the nationalist Short Strand area, went to court claiming his home had been attacked by protesters and that the PSNI had failed to provide assurances that it would prevent any future parade past the area. He also claimed his human rights to privacy and family life under European law had been breached. In a previous ruling, the High Court judge ruled that the commander in charge of the operation around the protests wrongly believed he was hampered by law from stopping the parades and arresting participants. Lawyers for the PSNI appealed against the findings, claiming they were flawed and unfair. They argued that senior officers were fully aware they had the power to stop any illegal protests, with plans in place to block the earliest marches. Those intentions only changed after intelligence revealed loyalist paramilitary involvement in associated violence that could pose a risk to life. The police attitude was public safety first, criminal justice consequences later, the court heard. Judges were also told of the level of resources deployed to deal with troublemakers and the decision to bring charges against passive demonstrators. Ruling on the appeal on Tuesday, Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan, who heard the case with Lord Justice Girvan and Mr Justice Weir, said: \\"The issues facing those policing this major public disruption which extended far beyond Belfast to all parts of Northern Ireland demonstrated the enormous difficulties for those policing modern societies in circumstances of community conflict and heightened tension. \\"We consider that the decision to manage disruption and pursue a subsequent criminal justice charging policy was well within the area of discretionary policing judgment which such situations require in light of the challenges posed by the circumstances.\\" Sir Declan said management of unnotified processions was not dealt with by the Parades Commission, but by police using public order powers. He said the panel of judges did not believe there was \\"anything in the management of the issues arising from these parades by police\\" to suggest the Public Processions (NI) Act 1998 and the Police (NI) Act 2000 had been undermined. Allowing the appeal, he added: \\"This was a difficult situation in which proportionate steps were taken to protect the Article 8 rights of the applicant and the other residents of the Short Strand.\\" Following the verdict, lawyers for DB indicated they would take their case to the Supreme Court in London. Summarize the main points of that article.","completion":"Judges have ruled that the police's decision to first manage major disruption and then later bring charges against offenders during weekly processions in Belfast in 2012 and 2013 was within their discretion.

There are a number of thought patterns that are often present among those who attempt suicide. If someone tells you they are experiencing one or more of these issues, this may be a matter for concern.","completion":"What most naturally follows after recognizing the warning signs of suicide and suicidal thought patterns is to take necessary steps to provide support, intervene, and ensure the person's safety. This involves understanding the risk factors, considering the protective factors, and actively engaging in conversation with the person to offer empathy and support. Additionally, connecting the person to professional help and monitoring their behavior can be crucial in preventing a suicide attempt. Here is a detailed breakdown of these preventive measures: 1. Understand the risk factors: Being familiar with the risk factors for suicide can provide better context when identifying warning signs. Risk factors can include mental health disorders, substance abuse, isolation, family history of suicide, stressful life events, and previous suicide attempts. 2. Consider protective factors: Protective factors are those that can help mitigate the risk of suicide. When providing support to an individual, considering their protective factors, such as strong social support, good mental health care, problem-solving skills, and a strong sense of purpose, can be helpful. 3. Engage in conversation: If you recognize warning signs, it's necessary to engage the person in conversation. Approach them with empathy, understanding and a non-judgmental attitude. Show genuine concern and listen actively. Encourage the person to open up about their emotions and thoughts. 4. Reinforce the importance of seeking help: Encourage the person to seek professional help from a mental health professional, such as a therapist, psychologist, or psychiatrist. Offer to assist them in finding suitable resources and support them in making appointments and attending sessions. 5. Establish a safety plan: Work collaboratively with the person to create a safety plan outlining what to do if they have suicidal thoughts or feelings again. This can include a list of steps to take, people to contact, and resources to access when they're feeling overwhelmed. 6. Connect them with support networks: Help the person identify their support network, which may include friends, family, colleagues, or support groups. Encourage them to connect with these networks and utilize available resources. 7. Monitor their behavior: Keep an eye on the individual's behavior, paying close attention to any changes or signs that they may be struggling.
