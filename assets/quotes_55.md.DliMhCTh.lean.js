You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Information: - Common law (also known as case law or precedent) is law developed by judges, courts, and similar tribunals, stated in decisions that nominally decide individual cases but that in addition have precedential effect on future cases. Common law is a third branch of law, in contrast to and on equal footing with statutes which are adopted through the legislative process, and regulations which are promulgated by the executive branch. In cases where the parties disagree on what the law is, a common law court looks to past precedential decisions of relevant courts. If a similar dispute has been resolved in the past, the court is usually bound to follow the reasoning used in the prior decision (a principle known as \\"stare decisis\\"). If, however, the court finds that the current dispute is fundamentally distinct from all previous cases (called a \\"matter of first impression\\"), judges have the authority and duty to resolve the issue (one party or the other has to win, and on disagreements of law, judges make that decision). Resolution of the issue in one case becomes precedent that binds future courts. \\"Stare decisis\\", the principle that cases should be decided according to consistent principled rules so that similar facts will yield similar results, lies at the heart of all common law systems. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - Case law is the set of existing rulings which made new interpretations of law and, therefore, can be cited as precedents. In some countries, such as the United States, the term is exclusively used for judicial decisions of selected appellate courts, courts of first instance, and other bodies discharging judicial functions. In other countries, such as most European countries, the term is applied to any set of rulings on law which is guided by previous rulings, for example, \\"patent office case law\\". These interpretations are distinguished from statutory law which are the statutes and codes enacted by legislative bodies; regulatory law which are regulations established by governmental agencies based on statutes; and in some states, common law which are the generally accepted laws carried to the colonies and former colonies of England (USA, Australia, etc.). Trials and hearings which are not selected as 'courts of first impression' do not have rulings that become case law; therefore, these rulings cannot be precedents for future court decisions. - Habeas corpus (Medieval Latin meaning literally \\"You may have the body\\") is a recourse in law whereby a person can report an unlawful detention or imprisonment before a court, usually through a prison official. - An Order in Council is a type of legislation in many countries, especially the Commonwealth realms. In the United Kingdom this legislation is formally made in the name of the Queen by and with the advice and consent of the Privy Council (\\"Queen-in-Council\\"), but in other countries the terminology may vary. The term should not be confused with Order of Council, which is made in the name of the Council without royal assent. - Natural law (\\"lex naturalis\\") is a philosophy that certain rights are inherent by virtue of human nature and can be understood universally through human reason. Historically, natural law refers to the use of reason to analyze human nature to deduce binding rules of moral behavior. The law of nature, as determined by nature, is universal. - The Exchequer of Pleas or Court of Exchequer was a court that dealt with matters of equity, a set of legal principles based on natural law and common law in England and Wales. Originally part of the \\"curia regis\\", or King's Council, the Exchequer of Pleas split from the \\"curia\\" during the 1190s, to sit as an independent, central court. The Court of Chancery's reputation for tardiness and expense resulted in much of its business transferring to the Exchequer. The Exchequer and Chancery, with similar jurisdictions, drew closer together over the years, until an argument was made during the 19th century that having two seemingly identical courts was unnecessary. As a result, the Exchequer lost its equity jurisdiction. With the Judicature Acts, the Exchequer was formally dissolved as a judicial body by an Order in Council of 16 December 1880. - The Court of Chancery was a court of equity in England and Wales that followed a set of loose rules to avoid the slow pace of change and possible harshness (or \\"inequity\\") of the common law. The Chancery had jurisdiction over all matters of equity, including trusts, land law, the administration of the estates of lunatics and the guardianship of infants. Its initial role was somewhat different, however; as an extension of the Lord Chancellor's role as Keeper of the King's Conscience, the Court was an administrative body primarily concerned with conscientious law. Thus the Court of Chancery had a far greater remit than the common law courts, whose decisions it had the jurisdiction to overrule for much of its existence, and was far more flexible. Until the 19th century, the Court of Chancery could apply a far wider range of remedies than the common law courts, such as specific performance and injunctions, and also had some power to grant damages in special circumstances. With the shift of the Exchequer of Pleas towards a common law court and loss of its equitable jurisdiction by the Administration of Justice Act 1841, the Chancery became the only national equitable body in the English legal system. - A statute is a formal written enactment of a legislative authority that governs a state, city or country. Typically, statutes command or prohibit something, or declare policy. Statutes are rules made by legislative bodies; they are distinguished from case law or precedent, which is decided by courts, and regulations issued by government agencies. Statute law is written by a government's legislative body and signed into law by its executive. - A judge presides over court proceedings, either alone or as a part of a panel of judges. The powers, functions, method of appointment, discipline, and training of judges vary widely across different jurisdictions. The judge is supposed to conduct the trial impartially and in an open court. The judge hears all the witnesses and any other evidence presented by the barristers of the case, assesses the credibility and arguments of the parties, and then issues a ruling on the matter at hand based on his or her interpretation of the law and his or her own personal judgment. In some jurisdictions, the judge's powers may be shared with a jury. In inquisitorial systems of criminal investigation, a judge might also be an examining magistrate. - Her Majestys Exchequer or just the Exchequer is a term used in the civil service of the United Kingdom for the accounting process of central government and for the government's \\"current account\\" i.e. money held from taxation and other government revenues in the Consolidated Fund It can be found used in various financial documents including the latest departmental and agency annual accounts. - The English Civil War (16421651) was a series of armed conflicts and political machinations between Parliamentarians (\\"Roundheads\\") and Royalists (\\"Cavaliers\\") over, principally, the manner of England's government. The first (164246) and second (164849) wars pitted the supporters of King Charles I against the supporters of the Long Parliament, while the third (164951) saw fighting between supporters of King Charles II and supporters of the Rump Parliament. The war ended with the Parliamentarian victory at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651. - A Court of Common Pleas is a common kind of court structure found in various common law jurisdictions. The form originated with the Court of Common Pleas in England, which was created to permit individual to press civil grievances against one another without involving the King. - Accounting or accountancy is the measurement, processing and communication of financial information about economic entities such as businesses and corporations. The modern field was established by the Italian mathematician Luca Pacioli in 1494. Accounting, which has been called the \\"language of business\\", measures the results of an organization's economic activities and conveys this information to a variety of users, including investors, creditors, management, and regulators. Practitioners of accounting are known as accountants. The terms \\"accounting\\" and \\"financial reporting\\" are often used as synonyms. - Curia regis is a Latin term meaning \\"royal council\\" or \\"king's court.\\" It was the name given to councils of advisors and administrators who served early French kings as well as to those serving Norman and later kings of England. - The Court of Common Pleas , or Common Bench , was a common law court in the English legal system that covered \`\` common pleas '' ; actions between subject and subject , which did not concern the king . Created in the late 12th to early 13th century after splitting from the Exchequer of Pleas , the Common Pleas served as one of the central English courts for around 600 years . Authorised by the Magna Carta to sit in a fixed location , the Common Pleas sat in Westminster Hall for its entire existence , joined by the Exchequer of Pleas and Court of King 's Bench . The court 's jurisdiction was gradually undercut by the King 's Bench and Exchequer of Pleas with legal fictions , the Bill of Middlesex and Writ of Quominus respectively . The Common Pleas maintained its exclusive jurisdiction over matters of real property until its dissolution , and due to its wide remit was considered by Sir Edward Coke to be the \`\` lock and key of the common law '' . It was staffed by one Chief Justice and a varying number of puisne justices , who were required to be Serjeants - at - Law , and until the mid 19th century only Serjeants were allowed to plead there . As one of the two principal common law courts with the King 's Bench , the Common Pleas fought to maintain its jurisdiction and caseload , in a way that during the 16th and 17th centuries was categorised as conservative and reactionary . Reaching an acceptable medium with the King 's Bench and Exchequer of Pleas proved to be the downfall of all three courts ; with several courts of near - identical jurisdiction , there was little need for separate bodies , and the superior courts of Westminster were merged by the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873 into a single High Court of Justice . With an Order in Council issued on 16 December 1880 , the Common Pleas Division of the High Court ceased to exist , marking the end of the Court of Common Pleas . - A tribunal, generally, is any person or institution with authority to judge, adjudicate on, or determine claims or disputeswhether or not it is called a tribunal in its title. For example, an advocate who appears before a court with a single judge could describe that judge as 'their tribunal'. Many governmental bodies that are titled 'tribunals' are so described to emphasize that they are not courts of normal jurisdiction. For example, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda is a body specially constituted under international law; in Great Britain, employment tribunals are bodies set up to hear specific employment disputes. Private judicial bodies are also often styled 'tribunals'. The word \\"tribunal\\" is not conclusive of a body's function. For example, in Great Britain, the Employment Appeal Tribunal is a superior court of record. - The Thirteen Colonies were a group of British colonies on the east coast of North America founded in the 17th and 18th centuries that declared independence in 1776 and formed the United States. The thirteen were: Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Georgia, Connecticut, Massachusetts Bay, Maryland, South Carolina, New Hampshire, Virginia, New York, North Carolina, and Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. - The Judicature Acts are a series of Acts of Parliament, beginning in the 1870s, which aimed to fuse the hitherto split system of courts in England and Wales. The first two Acts were the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873 (36 & 37 Vict c. 66) and the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1875 (38 & 39 Vict c. 77), with a further series of amending acts (12 in all by 1899). - Sir Edward Coke ((\\"cook\\"), formerly ; 1 February 1552 3 September 1634) was an English barrister, judge and, later, opposition politician, who is considered to be the greatest jurist of the Elizabethan and Jacobean eras. Born into a middle-class family, Coke was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, before leaving to study at the Inner Temple, where he was called to the Bar on 20 April 1578. As a barrister he took part in several notable cases, including \\"Slade's Case\\", before earning enough political favour to be elected to Parliament, where he served first as Solicitor General and then as Speaker of the House of Commons. Following a promotion to Attorney General he led the prosecution in several notable cases, including those against Robert Devereux, Sir Walter Raleigh, and the Gunpowder Plot conspirators. As a reward for his services he was first knighted and then made Chief Justice of the Common Pleas. - The Anglo-Saxons are a people who have inhabited Great Britain from the 5th century. They comprise people from Germanic tribes who migrated to the island from continental Europe, their descendants, and indigenous British groups who adopted some aspects of Anglo-Saxon culture and language. Historically, the Anglo-Saxon period denotes the period in Britain between about 450 and 1066, after their initial settlement and up until the Norman conquest. - In legal systems based on common law, a precedent, or authority, is a principle or rule established in a previous legal case that is either binding on or persuasive for a court or other tribunal when deciding subsequent cases with similar issues or facts . Common law legal systems place great value on deciding cases according to consistent principled rules so that similar facts will yield similar and predictable outcomes, and observance of precedent is the mechanism by which that goal is attained. The principle by which judges are bound to precedents is known as stare decisis. Black's Law Dictionary defines \\"precedent\\" as a \\"rule of law established for the first time by a court for a particular type of case and thereafter referred to in deciding similar cases.\\" Common law precedent is a third kind of law, on equal footing with statutory law (statutes and codes enacted by legislative bodies), and Delegated legislation (in U.K. parlance) or regulatory law (in U.S. parlance) (regulations promulgated by executive branch agencies). - A consolidated fund or the consolidated revenue fund is a term used in many countries with political systems derived from the Westminster system to describe the main bank account of the government. - England and Wales is a legal jurisdiction covering England and Wales, two of the four countries of the United Kingdom, which form the constitutional successor to the former Kingdom of England and follow a single legal system, known as English law. - The charter became part of English political life and was typically renewed by each monarch in turn, although as time went by and the fledgling English Parliament passed new laws, it lost some of its practical significance. At the end of the 16th century there was an upsurge in interest in Magna Carta. Lawyers and historians at the time believed that there was an ancient English constitution, going back to the days of the Anglo-Saxons, that protected individual English freedoms. They argued that the Norman invasion of 1066 had overthrown these rights, and that Magna Carta had been a popular attempt to restore them, making the charter an essential foundation for the contemporary powers of Parliament and legal principles such as \\"habeas corpus\\". Although this historical account was badly flawed, jurists such as Sir Edward Coke used Magna Carta extensively in the early 17th century, arguing against the divine right of kings propounded by the Stuart monarchs. Both James I and his son Charles I attempted to suppress the discussion of Magna Carta, until the issue was curtailed by the English Civil War of the 1640s and the execution of Charles. The political myth of Magna Carta and its protection of ancient personal liberties persisted after the Glorious Revolution of 1688 until well into the 19th century. It influenced the early American colonists in the Thirteen Colonies and the formation of the American Constitution in 1787, which became the supreme law of the land in the new republic of the United States. Research by Victorian historians showed that the original 1215 charter had concerned the medieval relationship between the monarch and the barons, rather than the rights of ordinary people, but the charter remained a powerful, iconic document, even after almost all of its content was repealed from the statute books in the 19th and 20th centuries. - The Glorious Revolution, also called the Revolution of 1688, was the overthrow of King James II of England (James VII of Scotland) by a union of English Parliamentarians with the Dutch stadtholder William III of Orange. William's successful invasion of England with a Dutch fleet and army led to his ascension of the English throne as William III of England jointly with his wife Mary II of England, James's daughter, in conjunction with the documentation of the Bill of Rights 1689. - The divine right of kings, divine right, or God's mandate is a political and religious doctrine of royal and political legitimacy. It asserts that a monarch is subject to no earthly authority, deriving the right to rule directly from the will of God. The king is thus not subject to the will of his people, the aristocracy, or any other estate of the realm. It implies that only God can judge an unjust king and that any attempt to depose, dethrone or restrict his powers runs contrary to the will of God and may constitute a sacrilegious act. It is often expressed in the phrase \\"by the Grace of God\\", attached to the titles of a reigning monarch. - A court is a tribunal, often as a government institution, with the authority to adjudicate legal disputes between parties and carry out the administration of justice in civil, criminal, and administrative matters in accordance with the rule of law. In both common law and civil law legal systems, courts are the central means for dispute resolution, and it is generally understood that all persons have an ability to bring their claims before a court. Similarly, the rights of those accused of a crime include the right to present a defense before a court.

This comes from the common law tradition which is widely used in many parts of world, particularly in England and countries that were part of the British Empire, including the United States and most Commonwealth countries. The Court of Common Pleas was one of the principal courts in this law system which dealt with \\"common pleas\\" or issues involving individuals. This court evolved in England in the 12th to 13th centuries, having initially been a part of the Exchequer of Pleas. As stated in the information given, the Court of Common Pleas was created to allow individuals to press grievances against each other without involving the king. The creation of this court marked a significant step within the evolution of the common law system as it provided an institution where matters of dispute could be settled based on established laws, regulations, and customs, ultimately contributing to the body of case law that would be referred to in future legal disputes. The Court of Common Pleas continued to perform a central role in English law for about 600 years, sitting in a fixed location in Westminster Hall and dealing primarily with matters of real property. Its judgments would serve as precedents for other common law courts, hence contributing to the continual evolution of common law. Throughout its existence, the Court of Common Pleas bore witness to numerous changes in the English legal system, including the strengthening of the jurisprudential principle of \\"stare decisis\\" or the doctrine of binding precedent, as well as the growth of case law as a rich source of law. In \\"common law\\" legal systems, the decisions made by the courts - including the Court of Common Pleas - carry weight in future legal decisions due to the principle of \\"stare decisis\\", which means \\"to stand by things decided\\". Through this principle, a form of law known as case law or precedent is developed, providing courts with a point of reference in dealing with cases where similar issues or facts arise. The Court of Common Pleas persisted until the late 19th century when the passage of the Judicature Acts led to the merger of the courts of Westminster into a single High Court of Justice. The Common Pleas Division of the High Court was finally dissolved by an Order in Council issued on 16 December 1880, marking the end of the Court of Common Pleas as an independent entity but its legacy continues within the common law system of England and Wales and wherever else this system of law is upheld. The significant contribution of the Court of Common Pleas to the development of common law ensures its enduring presence in legal history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Over time, the language evolved through various stages, from Old French to Middle French, and finally to the Modern French we know today. French vocabulary has been significantly influenced by Latin, Greek, and Germanic languages, particularly Old Frankish. Moreover, due to French colonial history, many French-speaking countries have inflections and loanwords unique to their regions.

EXCLUSIVE: Mom speaks for daughter allegedly raped at school Last fall, a 19-year-old high school senior was taken away in handcuffs and charged with sexually abusing a 15-year-old sophomore inside an empty classroom of a Bronx charter school. This allegedly happened during school hours, with students and teachers just a few doors down. Serious questions have emerged about how the Bronx Preparatory Charter School handled this outrageous incident and its aftermath. The mother of the victim has come forward to the Daily News to allege the school had inadequate security and took several hours to notify police. And the school told her daughter she’d have to return to the school where the incident took place, or reenter a lottery to try for another charter school. BRONX HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER BUSTED TRYING TO SEDUCE UNDERCOVER OFFICER POSING AS 14-YEAR-OLD: COPS The mother, whose name The News is withholding, said the school was more interested in protecting its own reputation than in her daughter’s well-being. “The school wants to look good and my daughter makes them look bad. So they don’t want her,” she said. On the outside, the school — whose motto is “No excuses!” — appears as a picture of success. It sits in a modern building in Claremont. Its officials boast that 100% of its students get into college, and its charter was just renewed by the State University of New York Charter Schools Institute. A closer look, however, reveals a different scenario, starting with the events of Nov. 18. During Period 5, the girl was supposed to meet her math teacher in the empty classroom for tutoring. The teacher never showed. While she was waiting, she says, an older classmate entered the room and raped her on a school desk while classes were in session down the hall. The older student was arrested that day, and when the girl was questioned by prosecutors with the Bronx district attorney’s office, she told them this wasn’t the only incident. NEW JERSEY TEEN BUSTED FOR RAPE OF BRONX STUDENT, 19, IN COLLEGE DORM: COPS According to a complaint filed in court, the victim said she’d been sexually molested previously by this same older student on as many as five occasions in empty classrooms. The girl says all of the incidents took place inside the school, during the school day. The suspect, Kevin Simpson, was arrested and is facing sexual misconduct charges. The girl’s mother says her daughter is traumatized and no longer attends school. The mother questions many aspects of the school’s handling of the incident. For example, it appears there was a significant delay between when a school employee was first told of the occurrence and when police were summoned, the mother says. The girl’s mother says she arrived at the charter shortly after getting a call from the school, and her daughter was in a room being questioned by school officials. She says police did not arrive until several hours later. An NYPD spokesman said there was nothing in its paperwork to indicate when cops were called and when they got there. Her daughter was devastated by the attack, becoming withdrawn, avoiding friends and writing dark poetry about being hurt by her attacker. She did not want to return to the building where she was abused. At first, the girl’s mother said, the school was helpful. ARIZONA STATE STUDENT, 18, KIDNAPPED AND RAPED ON HER WALK HOME FROM A PARTY: COPS Bronx Preparatory Charter School is managed by Democracy Prep, a national outfit that runs 18 charter schools across the country, including four high schools in the city. Democracy Prep quickly found a spot for her daughter at another one of its charter schools, in Harlem. But soon her daughter began failing classes. At the end of the school year, the mother says, Democracy Prep told her that her daughter would have to return to the school where she was assaulted. “They wanted her to go back where this incident took place,” the mother said. She said her daughter told her, “‘Everybody knows. The students know. I don’t want to go back.’” Furious, the mother refused, and since June, the girl has not attended school. “They didn’t give me no help. The ‘help’ . . . is to tell me to take her back? No,” the mom said. The girl’s family retained attorney Mark Segal of Segal & Lax, who filed suit. Democracy Prep spokeswoman Alice Maggin wouldn’t discuss the incident while the suit is pending, but said in general, “Democracy Prep runs 18 different schools. Just because we are the manager of those schools, one cannot move between two charter schools by law.” Maggin wouldn’t answer general questions about security at the school, and declined to reveal the name of the security company hired by the school. NEW STUDY FINDS 1 IN 4 COLLEGE WOMEN VICTIMS OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT But the incident last year wasn’t the only issue involving student discipline at Bronx Prep. The school, which opened in 2000, started strong, but in the past three years has fallen way behind. In April 2014, the school brought in Democracy Prep to take over management. In its most recent report, the school says it serves 750 students in grades 5 through 12. A random state inspection Dec. 2 found teachers had lost control of the class in nine of 18 classrooms visited. In a writing class of 18 students, “four browsed noneducational videos on YouTube, one student was on Facebook and two others monitored social media feeds.” The report stated that “20 minutes into the class period, none of these students had started the writing assignment despite the teacher’s repeated attempts to focus the class on lesson activities.” In the 2013-14 school year preceding the incident, 36 of 67 teachers left the school. In its February report, the state found Bronx Prep “is making progress in converting its student discipline system to the Democracy Prep ‘no excuses’ model.” The school implemented a program called “DREAM Dollars,” awarding points to students who behave. The state found “while the program is not at full fidelity, staff members report fewer large disruptive behaviors.” The school also ended its policy of letting high school students leave the building during lunch. Prospective parents would have a tough time knowing why any of this was going on. That’s because the minutes of board meetings posted online make no reference to the incident or the resultant security changes. Nancy Garvey, the board’s chairwoman until June, declined to discuss why that happened or anything else involving the school. She referred The News to Democracy Prep. Democracy Prep spokeswoman Maggin said, “Anyone who engages in the work of turnaround does so to provide better educational outcomes for students in persistently low-performing schools. It involves changing culture for students, teachers and families and instilling academic discipline and rigor. “Turnaround is exceptionally hard work that requires urgency and sustained effort.” BRONX CLASSMATES IDENTIFY TEEN ACCUSED OF TRYING TO RAPE GIRL: OFFICIALS Meanwhile, the girl’s mother is despondent, worried that her daughter will never return to school and wind up without a high school degree. “My daughter is a different person. She started eating a lot. She’s crying. She can be talking to you one minute and you’d think she was happy-go-lucky, and then she’s just bursting out crying,” the mom said. “She’s just lying in bed, all day. And then she can’t sleep all night. Why is she not sleeping at night? She says she’s having nightmares.” Now her daughter carries a hammer in her purse. “She says I’m just carrying it, nobody will know. Just in case somebody wants to do something they shouldn’t do.” What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"1. The story involves a serious case of alleged rape that took place within a Bronx charter school during school hours, involving a 19-year-old senior and a 15-year-old sophomore. The incident happened when the victim was waiting for her math teacher in an empty classroom. 2. Mother of the alleged victim claims the school had lax security, and they delayed reporting the incident to the police. Furthermore, she accuses the school of trying to preserve its image, rather than focusing on her daughter's welfare. 3. The accused, Kevin Simpson, was arrested and is now facing charges of sexual misconduct. The victim has alleged that there have been five such assaults in the past, all occurred within the school's premises. 4. After the incident, the victim was transferred to another charter school managed by Democracy Prep, the same organization that runs the Bronx Preparatory Charter School. However, due to her worsening academic performance, she was subsequently asked to return to her original school. 5. Disturbed by the incident, the victim has stopped attending school, and, according to her mother, is not in a good emotional state, often appearing withdrawn and writing dark poetry about her trauma. She reportedly now carries a hammer in her purse. 6. A separate issue, though potentially relevant, is the declining discipline and academic standards within the school, with a report showing that teachers in half of the classrooms visited had lost control. 7. The victim's family has retained an attorney and filed a lawsuit. However, the management of Democracy Prep would not discuss the specific incident due to the ongoing court case. 8. Overall, there are serious allegations of safety, security, and handling of victims' welfare within the Bronx Preparatory Charter School."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given a pair of words, deduce the type of relationship between them. The various types of relations are: 'HYPER', 'COORD' and 'RANDOM'. Let's denote the first word by X and the second word by Y. A COORD relationship holds when X and Y belong to the same semantic class. A HYPER relationship applies when X is a specific instance of Y. If niether COORD nor HYPER are applicable then the relationship is RANDOM. X: hat, Y: say","completion":"The relationship between the words 'hat' and 'say' is 'RANDOM'. To elucidate a bit more, these two words do not have a 'HYPER' (hypernym) or 'COORD' (coordinative) relationship. The 'HYPER' relationship applies when one word is a specific instance of the other, for example, 'Robin' and 'Bird'. Here, 'Robin' is a specific instance of 'Bird', hence a 'HYPER' relationship. 'COORD' relationship applies when the two words belong to the same semantic category. For example, words 'hat' and 'cap' have 'COORD' relationship because they both belong to the category of headwear. However, in the pair 'hat' and 'say', 'hat' is a noun referring to a piece of clothing for the head, while 'say' is a verb that refers to uttering words or expressing an opinion. They belong to different word categories and semantic classes, and one cannot be argued to be a specific instance of the other.

His host-mom came to him and asked if he would like to go along to the movies. He wanted to go, so he shook his head from side to side, said \\"Yes\\". His host-mom did a couple of steps back, and looked puzzled. She thought that he didn't want to go out because he shook his head from side to side. However, he wanted to go out to the movies. Bulgarians shake their heads from side to side when they mean \\"yes\\". People in other countries shake their heads from side to side when they mean \\"no\\". Gestures can have different meanings according to different cultures. For example, in America, putting your index finger and your thumb in a circle is commonly used as an OK sign that means everything is all right. However, in France, that sign is used to express \\"nothing\\" or \\"zero\\", which can have a negative meaning. Generally speaking, gestures are a type of communication that uses a part of our body, and when speaking with people from other cultures, gestures can be important keys or clues to understand them. However, we need to understand that those gestures vary from culture to culture, and it is necessary for us to have an open mind in understanding the different gestures.

Spectators are able to watch from the fence (and consequently covered in rubber from the drifters!) or sit on the bleachers. The restrooms were not too packed, and had both soap and paper towels; this can be rare during public events!

A physical change involves the conversion of a substance from one state of matter to another, without changing its chemical composition. Most matter consists of mixtures of pure substances, which can behomogeneous (uniform in composition) or heterogeneous (different regions possess different compositions and properties). Pure substances can be either chemical compounds or elements. Compounds can be broken down into elements by chemical reactions, but elements cannot be separated into simpler substances by chemical means. The properties of substances can be classified as either physical or chemical. Scientists can observe physical properties without changing the composition of the substance, whereas chemical propertiesdescribe the tendency of a substance to undergo chemical changes (chemical reactions) that change its chemical composition. Physical properties can be intensive or extensive. Intensive properties are the same for all samples; do not depend on sample size; and include, for example, color, physical state, and melting and boiling points.

The test states that Talia notices her dog's bone can travel with more speed on the hardwood floor than on the carpet when she slides it with the same level of strength. Step 2: Deduce the relationship between speed and distance. As the speed is higher on the hardwood floor, it implies that there's less friction on that surface compared to the carpet. Step 3: Consider the effect of friction on the bone's travel distance. Lower friction on the hardwood floor allows the bone to continue sliding for a longer distance, without the force of the friction slowing it down as much as it would on the carpet. Step 4: Connect the information from Steps 2 and 3 to determine the answer.

Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court has again cast aside an appeal that raised doubts about President Barack Obama's U.S. citizenship, a grass-roots legal issue that has gained little legal or political footing, but continues to persist in the courts. The justices without comment Monday rejected a challenge from Charles Kerchner Jr., a Pennsylvania man who sought a trial in federal court forcing the president to produce documents regarding his birth and citizenship. Kerchner's attorney, Mario Apuzzo, had argued in a petition with the Supreme Court that Obama did not fit the definition of a \\"natural-born citizen\\" required for the nation's highest office, as defined by Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution.","completion":"The most logical completion of this news story would be: The Supreme Court's decision to reject Charles Kerchner Jr.'s appeal without comment demonstrates that the case presented did not provide compelling evidence to question President Barack Obama's U.S. citizenship. Despite numerous legal challenges and conspiracy theories, official documents and records have consistently shown that President Obama was born in Hawaii, making him a natural-born U.S. citizen. The court's dismissal of this case is expected to further confirm the legitimacy of Obama's citizenship, although some individuals may continue to raise doubts and pursue similar cases. The Constitution states that only natural-born citizens can become President, and with this ruling, the Supreme Court has upheld Obama's right to hold the nation's highest office."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Understand the problem: Two trains, one moving at 60 km/hr and the other at 90 km/hr in opposite directions, have lengths of 1.9 km and 2.1 km, respectively. 2. Identify the given data: - Train A speed: 60 km/hr - Train A length: 1.9 km - Train B speed: 90 km/hr - Train B length: 2.1 km 3. Convert speeds to a common unit of measurement (meters/second): - Train A speed: (60,000 m/hr) * (1 hr / 3600 s) = 16.67 m/s - Train B speed: (90,000 m/hr) * (1 hr / 3600 s) = 25 m/s 4. Determine the relative speed: Because the trains are moving in opposite directions, the relative speed is the sum of their speeds. - Relative speed = 16.67 m/s + 25 m/s = 41.67 m/s 5. Find the total distance they need to cover to pass each other completely: The combined lengths of the two trains. - Total distance = 1.9 km + 2.1 km = 4 km = 4000 m 6.

The first oligarch to do so is murdered alongside his family by a blue-eyed assassin. Poetics lecturer Perry MacKendrick and his barrister wife Gail are on a holiday in Morocco to try and salvage their marriage after Perry slept with one of his students. Perry strikes up a friendship with Dima, a hearty and boisterous Russian with an eidetic memory. The two men bond over drinks and tennis before Dima invites both MacKendricks to his daughter's birthday. At the birthday party, Dima gets Perry alone and gives him a USB stick that links corrupt British politicians and businessmen to the Russian mafia. He fears for his life after hearing of his fellow oligarch's fate, and pleads with Perry to turn the USB stick over to MI6 when he returns to London. Perry turns the information over to MI6 agent Hector, the investigator in charge. The information provided by Dima enables Hector and his supervisor Billy to witness a meeting between the Prince and corrupt politician Aubrey Longrigg. Billy refuses to sanction an investigation on a chance meeting. Hector continues regardless and recruits the MacKendricks to help stage a chance encounter with Dima in France. There, Dima provides all the names of his clients and confirms each banker and politician involved has received £5 million each for their endorsement of the new bank, with Longrigg receiving £30 million.

Make this lower case.","completion":"they started as members of the best brass bands and became fulltime virtuoso. It is quite common for musicians to begin their careers as part of brass bands before evolving into full-time virtuosos. The term \\"virtuoso\\" is typically used to describe a highly skilled musician, often one who is an expert on a particular instrument or in a specific style of music. The journey of these musicians can be divided into a few different stages. 1. Early exposure to music: Many musicians are initially attracted to music through the influence of their family members, friends, or even teachers. They may have grown up in a household filled with music or attended a school with a strong music program. These early experiences help to foster a love and appreciation for music that stays with them throughout their lives. 2. Joining a brass band: A common stepping stone for aspiring musicians is joining a brass band. These bands consist primarily of wind and percussion instruments, such as trumpets, trombones, saxophones, and tubas. Brass bands provide a great opportunity for young musicians to learn ensemble playing, develop their technique, and gain a deeper understanding of music theory. 3. Developing technical proficiency: As they spend more time playing in brass bands, these musicians begin to focus on mastering their craft. This may involve attending workshops, taking private lessons, or enrolling in a music conservatory. At this stage, they will work tirelessly to refine their intonation, tone, and technique, all while gaining a deeper understanding of music theory and learning to read sheet music. 4. Building a reputation: As these musicians continue to improve, they may begin to receive invitations to participate in competitions, attend masterclasses, and perform at festivals. These opportunities often act as stepping stones, allowing them to establish themselves within the music community and build a strong reputation. 5. Embracing the role of a virtuoso: Eventually, these musicians may be recognized as virtuosos on their chosen instrument. This designation is a testament to their talent, dedication, and hard work. They may continue to perform as solo artists, form or join small ensembles, or even teach others. Transitioning from brass band members to full-time virtuosos is no easy task. It requires years of dedication, passion, and hard work. These musicians are living proof that with the right guidance and perseverance, anything is possible."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Article Excerpt Apple Inc. is working with component suppliers in Asia to test several designs for television sets, people familiar with the situation said, suggesting that the company is moving closer to expanding its offerings for the living room. Executives at some of Apple's suppliers said the company has been testing designs for a large-screen high-definition set. Two people said Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., which assembles the iPhone and iPad, has been collaborating with Japan's Sharp Corp. on the design of the new television for several months. \\"It isn't a formal project yet. It is still in the early stage of ... ||||| S There are all kinds of Apple rumors out there; big ones, small ones, smart ones, dumb ones. God knows we run enough of them ourselves. But there's a genus of the species that we never post, ever, because it's so obviously and insidiously dumb and wrong and bad. And here is, without exaggeration, the very absolute worst example of it I've ever seen. Ladies and gentlemen, meet your worst Apple rumor of the year, and maybe of all time. You may have seen the headlines already, here and here and probably most other tech sites you follow. The basic gist: APPLE'S HDTV TO HAVE 3D TECH THAT WILL CHANGE TELEVISION FOREVER There is, as you might have noticed the last time you attained even the vaguest state of consciousness, no such thing as an Apple HDTV. There never has been. That headline is like saying Charles Barkley might put up a triple double in the Space Jam rematch. So how did a product that doesn't—and may well never—exist suddenly get features that, if it's even possible, exist even less? Because this morning, the two worst rumor sources in tech found each other. Analysts met patents, and created a perfect storm of bullshit. This morning, before the market opened, two Morgan Stanley analysts released a report about \\"iTV,\\" Apple's bold foray into our living rooms. The mythical television set would be worth 13 billion to Apple in the US alone, 39 billion globally, and 68,000 gumdrops in Candyland. That's harmless enough; market projections are at least based on how many TVs people buy currently, and a reasonable guess at how many of those people might buy the Apple version. Sure, why not? But then the trouble starts. It turns out that not only do Morgan Stanley's analysts have a pretty good idea of how many non-existent iTVs Apple will sell, they're also privy to a swath of non-existent features that'll come with it. Including, as StreetInsider happily passes along, a 3D remote control, a \\"groundbreaking 3D imaging and display system\\" that knows where you are and what you're doing and, presumably, shows Duck Dynasty from the appropriate angle, and the ability to display an athlete's blood pressure during football games because why not, might as well, it's all just make-believe anyway. Tickle Honey Boo Boo from your couch while you're at it. It's tempting to think that these analysts know something you don't. That they have covert sources slipping juicy leaks into their Honeybaked Ham deliveries. But you know what? They don't. They're guessing, same as anyone else. We don't cover analyst rumors, ever, because analysts don't know anything. To put it another way: if they did, Apple's HDTV would be here already. Years ago. But what makes this particular rumor so galling is that it's not just the normal analyst projections and assumptions and bloviation. It's not even that it's yet another rumor—after nearly THREE YEARS of unfulfilled rumormongering—about a product that is Not Even a Thing. It's that all of these features that the Morgan Stanley braintrust cites come from patents. Come on, guys. You know better than this. The problem with taking patents at face value is that patents aren't products and, more importantly, are often never even intended to be. Companies file patents defensively, stockpiling them like warheads for the never-ending infringement wars. They are, in their own way, every bit as Not Even a Thing as iTV itself. That's what every single one of these \\"features\\" is based on. It gets worse, it gets worse! These aren't even new patents Morgan Stanley dug up from some Cupertino patent bunker. The most recent one was filed in 2008, and most were granted months or years ago. Or not at all, which, even better. Will Apple act on them someday? Maybe. Right after they get to that wearable display, and finish building all those iTunes kiosks. Look, it's just a harmless rumor, sure. But it's also a lazy rumor, one that every single person involved knows has zero percent chance of becoming true in any reasonable amount of time. Could Apple announce an iTV tomorrow? Sure. Could it somehow put Duck Dynasty on your couch? Of course. But it won't. And no one knows that better than the people telling you it might. ||||| So, how could Apple (AAPL) “revolutionize” the television? How about by providing full three-dimensional projections in your living room? StreetInsider reports that Morgan Stanley analysts Katy Huberty and Jerry Liu have outlined some possibilities for what features an Apple HDTV could deliver based on patents the company has filed over the last several years. The most interesting feature the analysts outlined was a “groundbreaking 3D imaging and display system that optically detects human positions and motions, projects virtual objects onto a display area, and provides audio and visual feedback.” Other possible features include Siri integration, a 3D remote control application that displays a cursor “by the position and orientation at which it is held,” and a “search engine interface to search content across various libraries such as iTunes, imdb.com, amazon.com, netflix.com, and social networking sites, as well as advertising content.” We obviously have no idea if any of these radical concepts will actually make it onto an Apple TV but it does give us an idea of just how big Apple is thinking when it talks about ushering in a new era of television. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"Apple is reportedly exploring designs for television sets in collaboration with its suppliers in Asia.

In other words, this statement highlights the importance of building and enforcing a regulatory framework for the European Union to ensure proper functioning and cooperation among its member countries. The European Parliament, the Council, and the Commission are the three primary institutions responsible for these tasks. The European Parliament represents European citizens and legislation. Its main roles are to legislate, supervise, and exercise democratic control over the European Union's political activities. The Council, on the other hand, is composed of representatives from each member state's government and represents national interests. It has a crucial role in the European Union's decision-making process, as it is responsible for adopting laws and coordinating policies. Lastly, the Commission acts as the European Union's executive body, implementing legislation and ensuring that all member countries comply with EU laws and rules. President Prodi's statement underscores the need for a comprehensive regulatory framework that takes into account the diverse interests and needs of member countries while fostering cooperation and unity within the European Union. This includes the establishment of laws and guidelines for various sectors, such as economic policy, environmental protection, and social welfare. A proper regulatory framework is indispensable for the smooth functioning of the European Union. It not only enables the efficient and effective management of EU resources but also ensures that the rights and interests of all European citizens are protected. Moreover, this framework promotes integration between member countries, fostering mutual trust, and strengthening the EU's global position. To achieve this, the European institutions must work cohesively and transparently, engaging in regular consultations and dialogues with various stakeholders. In addition, the institutions should adopt a proactive approach to address emerging challenges, such as technological advancements, global crises, and geopolitical shifts. In conclusion, the statement emphasizes the importance of a robust regulatory framework for the European Union, which will only be possible through the close collaboration of the European Parliament, the Council, and the Commission. This framework is vital for maintaining stability, protecting the interests of European citizens, and ensuring the effectiveness and unity of the EU in the face of various global challenges."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: The fight over the US government’s definitions for certain foods has flared up again. It’s no longer just a fight for milk farmers, who’ve grown increasingly angry about plant-based food companies (think soy, almond, and cashews) calling their liquid products “milk.” For the first time, vegetables are being roped into the debate—all because of the arrival and popularization of “cauliflower rice.” “Only rice is rice, and calling ‘riced vegetables’ ‘rice,’ is misleading and confusing to consumers,” Betsy Ward, president of industry lobby USA Rice, said in a statement earlier this month. “We may be asking the Food and Drug Administration and other regulatory agencies to look at this.” Ward added that Scott Gottlieb, the new Trump-appointed FDA commissioner, could use his power to enforce the agency’s existing definitions for food, the so-called “standards of identity.” Reuters/Khaled Abdullah Cauliflower by the truckload. Only recently did cauliflower rice appear in the freezer section of the grocery store—and in close proximity to frozen rice and vegetable packages, Michael Klein, a spokesman for the rice lobby, told Quartz. Klein adds that one company, Green Giant Fresh, used a “Move over, rice” marketing campaign. But the cauliflower side isn’t worried. “Using the FDA to combat merchandising efforts? That’s a story they’re telling their retail partners,” said Gina Nucci of the California-based produce company, Mann Packing, which sells cauliflower products. “Every section of the grocery store is fighting for the same food dollar. Same share of stomach. Consumers are smart. I don’t think anyone is going to mistake regular rice for a riced cauliflower product, frozen or fresh.” She says consumers are on the lookout for rice alternatives because there’s a demand for ready-to-eat products that take less time to prepare than whole-head cauliflower rice. Still, this isn’t a clean case for the rice lobby, which now finds itself in the unenviable position of appearing to speak out of both sides of its mouth. While the industry group frets over shredded cauliflower, some of its members benefit from relaxed enforcement of standards of identity. Rice milk and yogurt can be found at nearly all major supermarket retailers, including Costco and Whole Foods 365 brand. Yet greater enforcement of the FDA’s standards of identity would likely give those rice products companies trouble. For its part, the rice lobby says the goal should be to avoid confusing consumers—but it does not want to be the arbiter of deciding whether consumers are confused when they see rice milk on the shelves of the dairy section. (The dairy industry has been vocal about this matter: “Milk is a product that comes from cows,” it contended (pdf) in February.) “Just as with milk, no one owns the word ‘rice,'” said Michele Simon, executive director of the Plant Based Foods Association. To date, in at least two US lawsuits (one against Whitewave Foods Company in 2013 and the other against Trader Joe’s Company in 2015) judges have dismissed cases in which plaintiffs sought to have companies stop using the word “milk” when marketing soy milk. “As long as consumers are not confused,” Simon added, “I doubt USA Rice will get very far with FDA.” The Good Food Institute earlier this year submitted to the government a request that it clarify how foods can be named. “This is what’s so frustrating about this issue,” Joanna Grossman, a lobbyist for the group, told Quartz. ”Everybody wants to pick and choose what should come under greater enforcement and, in my mind, there’s a broader problem. So many of these definitions haven’t caught up with the times. We’re operating in a sphere where some of these definitions are really strange and obscure.” Take, for instance, tamales. Technically speaking, under the current USDA standards of identity, frozen vegetarian tamales in the supermarket freezer section aren’t tamales. That’s because, under agency rules, 25% of a tamale must be comprised of meat. ||||| Cauliflower rice has been popping up in grocery freezer aisles and on the menu at restaurants nationwide, as an increasing number of health-conscious eaters look to curb their carb intake. The plant-based imitation food seems to be especially prevalent in Silicon Valley, where tech workers are cutting carbs and eating lots of fat in an attempt to lead longer, better lives. The rising popularity of the carb-light alternative to rice isn't making the rice industry happy. A rice lobby group said it may ask the US government to review its definition of rice in an effort to lessen the competition in cauliflower, Quartz reported. Cauliflower rice looks like rice. It's made from pulsing the vegetable briefly in a food processor. Like rice, it soaks up the juices and seasonings of whatever it's cooked with. But on its own, cauliflower rice has the bland taste of cauliflower and the wetness of minced zucchini. On a recent visit to Mealmade, an on-demand food delivery startup based in San Francisco, I watched one cook chop cauliflower while another pulverized the vegetable in a food processor. Later in the day, they would scoop it into compostable containers for a variety of dishes. The startup, founded in 2015, specializes in healthy takes on comfort food classics. The Carne Asada Taco Bowl tops cauliflower rice with grass-fed sirloin steak, fried plantains, organic pickled peppers, and guacamole. The Orange Chicken — a best-seller according to Mealmade — buries the cauliflower rice in coconut-flour fried chicken, cilantro, and sliced kumquats. Cauliflower rice is also on the menus at on-demand food delivery startups Sprig and Thistle, as well as meal-kit delivery services Blue Apron and Sun Basket. There are about two grams of net carbohydrates in a cup of cauliflower, compared to 51 grams in white rice and 42 grams in brown rice. The rice industry is not thrilled at the prospect of an imitation food, especially a guilt-free one, taking away their market share. \\"Only rice is rice, and calling 'riced vegetables' (as cauliflower rice is sometimes named) 'rice,' is misleading and confusing to consumers,\\" Betsy Ward, president of USA Rice, said in a statement in May. \\"We may be asking the Food and Drug Administration and other regulatory agencies to look at this.\\" The FDA has oversight over food labeling and can force a company to change a product name if it is likely to stump customers. For example, Tyson's Any'tizers Boneless Chicken Wyngz* feature an asterisk because the \\"wyngz\\" contain no real wing meat. Silicon Valley startup Hampton Creek created a line of \\"Just Mayo\\" products made from plants. The FDA issued a letter in 2015 saying the products can't be called mayonnaise because they do not contain eggs. (The FDA later decided only semantic changes on the label were necessary.) Dairy groups have waged similar battles with makers of soy and almond milk. Michele Simon, executive director of the Plant Based Foods Association, remains optimistic. \\"Just as with milk, no one owns the word 'rice,'\\" Simon told Quartz. ||||| Summary:","completion":"The rising popularity of cauliflower rice as a healthy, carb-light alternative to traditional rice has sparked controversy among food suppliers in the US, with industry lobby group USA Rice arguing that its labelling is misleading and confusing to customers.

Ask them if you can expect them to call you or if the results will be posted in an online chart for you to view.If you don’t hear back within 3 weeks, call your doctor’s office and ask about the results. Most of the time, pap smear test results come back normal. Sometimes, however, you might get a result of “abnormal” or “unclear.” If this happens, don’t worry! Even an abnormal test result doesn’t necessarily mean that anything is seriously wrong. Talk to your doctor about scheduling a follow-up appointment for further tests. In rare cases, abnormal cells in a pap smear can be a sign of cancer in your cervix or uterus. If your doctor suspects that your test results might indicate a serious problem, they may have you come in for more tests, like a colonoscopy or a biopsy (tissue sample). Sometimes, your doctor will recommend that you wait 6 months to a year and then have another pap smear done. If the abnormal cells are still there or if they see major changes since your last exam, they might decide to do further testing. How often you need to get a pap smear depends on a lot of things, such as your age, your medical history, and how high your risk is for problems like cervical cancer or sexually transmitted infections. Work with your doctor to figure out the best time for you to come in for your next routine pap smear and pelvic exam. Most doctors recommend that you get your first pap smear at age 21, and then follow up every 3 years (or more often if there are abnormal results).

The premise focuses on an individual wearing a pink shirt while riding a brown horse in a rodeo, whereas the hypothesis talks about an outfielder waiting to catch a flyball for the final out presumably in a baseball game. Since both sentences are describing separate events, there is no direct connection between the premise and the hypothesis that would allow us to determine if the hypothesis is true or false. To elaborate, the premise is set in the context of a rodeo, which is a competitive equestrian sport that primarily includes events such as riding, roping, and racing. The individual described as wearing a pink shirt might be participating in a specific event within the rodeo like barrel racing or bareback riding. These events require a certain level of athleticism, horsemanship, and skill from both the participant and the horse. Therefore, the main focus of the premise is the performance of the horse and rider in this particular context. On the other hand, the hypothesis is set in the context of a baseball game. The mention of an outfielder indicates the specific position that the person is playing on the field, which is responsible for catching and fielding balls that are hit towards the outfield. The hypothesis also implies that the game might be nearing its end since the outfielder is waiting for the flyball for the final out. Baseball is a sport that requires a strong teamwork strategy, physical skills, and mental alertness. The main focus in this hypothesis is the completion of the baseball game, which is unfolding independently from the rodeo described in the premise. In conclusion, there is no information in the premise to support or refute the hypothesis because they both describe separate events, settings, and subjects without any direct connection between them. To determine the accuracy of the hypothesis, we would require additional premises or information specific to the baseball game being discussed.

Paragraph: Registration fees for Illinois lawyers could jump as much as 49 a year if lawmakers adopt two separate measures to bolster pro-bono services and support for lawyers with drug and alcohol problems. The Illinois Supreme Court is pushing for legislation that would allow it to dedicate money raised through the fee hikes to legal services to the poor. The justices are floating a 42 increase to shore up financing for pro-bono work, as the normal funding mechanism for legal services has fallen short in recent years. Currently, support for non-profit legal aid groups comes from interest generated on the Lawyers' Trust Fund, which pools clients' money that attorneys hold for such matters as escrow funds. But low interest rates and a sagging economy mean there is less money being generated. After hours of discussion, the high court agreed that raising the registration fees would be the best way to address the declining revenues, Chief Justice Moses W. Harrison II said. The judges were reluctant to raise those fees but eventually decided that supporting probono services was important enough \\"and lawyers had a responsibility to contribute\\" to the cause, Harrison said. Last year, the high court raised the base fee for active attorneys to 180 from 140. Lawyers in their first three years of practice or who are inactive pay 90, and retired lawyers pay nothing. Legislation circulated by the high court's lobbyist specifies that the hike would apply to attorneys \\"paying full annual registration fees.\\" In 2001, there were 57,392 active attorneys in Illinois and 74,311 on the full roll, according to the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission. The hike would raise roughly 2.4 million. Last year, interest on the trust fund totaled 4.5 million, but service and handling fees consumed 538,000 of that amount. This year's returns are projected to be anywhere between 700,000 and 1 million short of that mark, said Ruth Ann Schmitt, the executive director of Lawyers Trust Fund of Illinois. Harrison said the fee hikes are designed only to counter the shortfall in interest income, not add to the total amount available. \\"Our legal services are already stretched to the breaking point,\\" Schmitt said. \\"We have a tough time raising enough money to properly fund services that our clients need.\\" Neither the Illinois State Bar Association nor The Chicago Bar Association has taken a stance on the proposed hikes.

At every opportunity, she would let her voice soar and dance along with the ambient sounds of her world. She dreamt of one day becoming a professional singer, standing on the stage as the audience listened to every note she sang and every lyric she penned. However, life as a teenager often proved chaotic, and Terri found her rock in the close relationship she shared with her elder brother Paul. Paul, despite being older, understood Terri's passion and encouraged her every step of the way. Together, they would practice and rehearse for hours, getting lost in the melodies they created. Paul knew his sister had a talent that needed to be appreciated and Terri was grateful for having such a supportive brother. One day, Paul's friend, Simon, invited them to his graduation-day barbecue. Friends and family gathered at the venue to celebrate Simon's accomplishment and the air was filled with laughter and the aroma of sizzling barbecue. Terri tagged along with her brother, as she relished the opportunity to spend more time with him. However, amidst the good vibes, a storm was brewing. Paul did not get along well with Simon's acquaintance, Robin Childers. They had had a falling out over Robin's previous relationship with Jay the previous summer. Robin's reputation as a troublemaker was widespread and Paul did not want Robin's drama-filled life to seep into his or Terri's. He was afraid that Robin could jeopardize Terri's dream. As the evening wore on, tensions escalated between Paul and Robin. Eventually, it culminated into a nasty altercation that caused the celebratory vibe to sour. Concerned for her brother's well-being and her own safety, Terri quietly slipped away from the festivities and retreated to her safe space -her home studio. It was just the two of them in their small abode, their parents away for the weekend, so Terri felt a strange, unnameable sense of unease creeping up on her as she sang alone in the room. Soon, Paul managed to compose himself after the fight and return home. Upon noticing Terri's withdrawal from the event and the somber mood that weighed over her, Paul knew he had to do something drastic to ensure his sister's safety and mental well-being. He placed a call to Simon, asking for help in sensitive yet unresolved situation. And so, Simon decided to fly to Los Angeles with Terri, hoping to take her away from the negative environment and provide her with an opportunity to focus on her dreams. He had connections in the music industry and remembered fondly how Terri had sung at the party earlier, realizing the potential in her voice. Simon believed that by pulling Terri away from the drama and into a city full of dream-chasers, she would have the chance to turn her dreams into reality, surrounded by a supportive network that extended beyond her brother. Paul, understanding that sometimes one has to let go of those closest to them for their growth, grudgingly agreed to let Terri leave with Simon. He trusted Simon to take care of her and swore to visit her in Los Angeles as often as he could.

Write highlights for this article: Jury selection is set to start Monday in a trial pitting two children of Martin Luther King Jr. against their brother, whom they accuse of mishandling the late civil rights leader's estate. Bernice King and her brother Martin Luther King III say Dexter King took funds from their father's estate. Bernice King and Martin Luther King III sued their brother Dexter King in July 2008, one month after accusing him of converting \\"substantial funds from the estate's financial account at Bank of America\\" for his own use, according to the lawsuit. Also named as a defendant is the Martin Luther King Jr. estate, which is incorporated. Dexter King is the corporation's president and chief executive, in addition to being the estate's administrator. The three are the only shareholders in the corporation, and the plaintiffs hold at least 20 percent of its outstanding shares. The lawsuit contends Dexter King illegally and fraudulently converted estate funds and should be forced to repay the money and reimburse the plaintiffs' legal costs. The document, which lists five counts, does not say how much he is accused of taking. Dexter King has denied the accusations. The lawsuit reveals a very public fissure in an iconic family that has always professed unity, particularly as questions have swirled around some of their financial dealings. The three are the only surviving children of Martin Luther King Jr., who was assassinated in 1968, and Coretta Scott King, who died in 2006. Their oldest child, Yolanda King, died in 2007. Bernice King administers her mother's estate. In a countersuit, Dexter King has asked a judge to force Bernice King to turn over their mother's personal papers, including love letters central to a now-defunct 1.4 million book deal. Martin Luther King III and Bernice King complained that Dexter King refused to hold shareholders meetings, which they said was another example of his lack of transparency in handling their father's estate. There had been no shareholders' meeting of the corporation since 2004, something that Dexter King blamed on the distraction caused by the deaths of his mother and sister. Judge Ural D. Glanville ordered a meeting, which was held last week. In a hearing held in late September, Glanville, who will preside over the trial in Fulton County Superior Court, also expressed serious concern about governance of the King estate. The judge issued an order saying \\"the court is extremely troubled.\\" He noted that Dexter King, as the majority shareholder, wields significant power in the corporation because he holds 80 percent of its shares. He alone can constitute a quorum for transacting business, the order says. The judge warned all three Kings that any failure to comply with the Georgia Corporation Code could result in the dissolution of the corporation and the appointment of a receiver.","completion":"The trial between two of Martin Luther King Jr.'s children and their brother Dexter King is set to begin with jury selection on Monday.

The percentage of Americans who say they don't have health insurance dropped to 13.4 percent in April, according to Gallup. The number of uninsured Americans has been steadily dropping since last fall, the polling company said, when a peak 18 percent of Americans said they did not have health care coverage. Gallup reports that number of Americans without health insurance decreased at a faster pace as the federally mandated deadline to purchase insurance arrived. Gallup reports that percent of Americans without health insurance dropped to 13.4 during the final month Americans could sign up for health care through the federal exchange. The number of uninsured Americans has been steadily dropping since last fall when a peak 18 percent of Americans said they did not have health care coverage. African-Americans saw the most dramatic increase in health care coverage between the close of 2013, when 20.9 percent told Gallup they did not have coverage and April. Then, only 13.8 percent of blacks polled told Gallup they did not have insurance. Hispanics continue to say they do not have health insurance at higher rates than other demographic groups. In April, 33.2 percent told Gallup they were uninsured. The percent of Hispanics and Americans making less than 36,000 a year who did not have coverage dropped by 5.5 percent in April, respectively. Gallup's numbers are consistent with a Health and Human Services report released last Thursday that showed Hispanic enrollment below what it could be and a high rate of enrollment among blacks. More than 8 million Americans have signed up for health care insurance through the state and federal exchanges, the report said. The Obama administration did not say how many people had signed up for health care, but the number surpasses a previous report of 8 million provided by the president two weeks earlier. The original deadline to purchase. healthcare insurance was March 31. The Obama administration has extended. deadlines multiple times to accommodate Americans having problems with. government's Obamacare sign-up site, healthcare.gov, and Americans with. pre-existing conditions moving out of the government's temporary. high-risk pools and into the general insurance marketplace. Gallup. took its survey of 14,700 Americans from April 1 - 30. The new deadline. for average Americans who had already started the sign up process to. get covered was April 15. Some of. the people Gallup polled who did not have insurance the first or second. week of April may have since finished applying for coverage, potentially. bringing the percent of Americans who do not have coverage down. further. Other Americans may be. waiting to get coverage until for the provision of Obamacare that. requires employers to cover full-time employees to kick in at the start. of 2015. 'On the other hand, it is likely that some newly insured Americans will. not pay their premiums and will rejoin the ranks of the uninsured,' Gallup notes. White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters last week that the White House did not have, 'hard, concrete' numbers on the number of people who had both signed up for Obamacare through the federal health exchange and made their first payment. A report issued last week by House Republicans estimated that one-third of those enrollees have not paid their premiums. The House Energy & Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations report is based on information provided to the committee by 'all 160 insurance providers in the federally facilitated marketplace.' The White House disputes the Republican report has not provided evidence to the contrary. A House Republican report claims that one-third of Americans who signed up for Obamacare through the federal health exchange have not yet made their first payment on their plans.

The midfielder is at the centre of a row between the clubs after Fulham head coach Rene Meulensteen said he knew that Morrison, 20, wanted to move to Craven Cottage and confirmed that their bid for him had been rejected by West Ham. It is understood that Fulham offered £7.5million for Morrison and midfield partner Mo Diame, which was dismissed by West Ham, who value Morrison alone at £10m.

In response to the accusations, the Premier League is expected to launch an investigation into the matter to determine if Fulham and Rene Meulensteen indeed violated league rules regarding tapping up a player and making the bid public. Should they be found guilty, Fulham could face sanctions, including potential fines and other punitive measures, designed to deter any club from engaging in similar actions in the future. West Ham's determination to protect their interests in Ravel Morrison is seen as a clear indication of the club's regard for the talented 20-year-old midfielder. They believe that Morrison is a crucial asset to the team, both in the present and moving forward. With a valuation of £10 million for Morrison alone, West Ham has demonstrated their unwillingness to part with the player for anything less than their asking price. Fulham, on the other hand, will likely defend their actions and dispute West Ham's claims of wrongdoing. They may argue that they made a legitimate bid for the players and that any potential discussions regarding the transfer with Morrison were within legal boundaries. Furthermore, they could emphasize that Meulensteen's public comments were not intended to unsettle the player but merely to express Fulham's interest in signing Morrison. In the meantime, Ravel Morrison may find himself in an uncomfortable position, caught between two clubs in a bitter dispute. While West Ham fights to protect their asset and uphold league rules, Fulham may continue to pursue the player in the hopes of bolstering their squad. Ultimately, the outcome of the Premier League's investigation will have a significant impact on the player's future, as well as the relationship between the two clubs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Meanwhile, across the street, Luke's younger brother Roy L. Fuchs (also played by Warden) is desperate to keep his used car lot from being demolished and replaced by a proposed freeway exit. Wanting to collect life insurance money and New Deal from Luke, Roy hires his mechanic, ex-demolition derby driver Mickey, to recklessly drive Luke's 1957 Chevrolet Two-Ten coupe around the block with Luke in the passenger's seat. After the Chevy crashes back into the lot, Luke dies of a heart attack, but leaves Rudy with evidence that Roy staged the \\"accident\\". In an attempt to prevent Roy from gaining any inheritance, Rudy has his superstitious co-worker Jeff and mechanic Jim help him bury Luke in the lot's backyard in an Edsel that was once New Deal's sign ornament. They explain to Roy that Luke went on a vacation to Miami. The next night, Rudy and his friends make an illegal live broadcast of their commercial in the middle of a football game, but it goes awry when Jeff finds out the car on display is red (which he believes is bad luck) and female model Margaret has her dress stuck on the hood ornament, which rips and exposes her when the hood is popped open. The commercial results in New Deal receiving a massive number of customers the next day.

THIS HOUSE BELIEVES that countries which suffer from natural disasters should receive debt relief What argument could one make about this debate topic?","completion":"In this debate, the proposition that countries suffering from natural disasters should receive debt relief has many potential arguments that can be made. For the purposes of providing a detailed and long answer, we will focus on the following key points: humanitarian grounds for debt relief, economic rebuilding and sustainable development, global political and moral obligations, and long-term improvements for disaster preparedness and resilience. 1. Humanitarian Grounds for Debt Relief: The most immediate reason to argue in favor of debt relief for disaster-stricken nations is on humanitarian grounds. Natural disasters like hurricanes, earthquakes, and floods often result in massive displacement, destruction of infrastructure, and loss of life. By providing debt relief, the international community would be essentially providing much-needed funding for rescue, relief, and rehabilitation efforts. Rather than diverting funds to pay off debt, affected countries could direct resources towards addressing the significant challenges faced by their citizens, including access to clean water, food, shelter, and healthcare. 2. Economic Rebuilding and Sustainable Development: Natural disasters can be a significant setback for the economic development of a country. The destruction of infrastructure, loss of agricultural lands, and disruptions in businesses can hinder economic progress, leading to a decline in GDP, increased poverty, and reduced investor confidence. Debt relief would help free up the necessary funds for affected countries to not only rebuild their economies but also invest in sustainable development projects that could make them more resilient to future disasters. For example, investments in renewable energy, disaster-resilient infrastructure, and early warning systems could reduce the impact of future natural disasters, benefiting both the country and the global community. 3. Global Political and Moral Obligations: Supporters of debt relief for disaster-stricken nations argue that the global community has a moral obligation to help those nations recover, especially given that the impacts of natural disasters can be intensified due to climate change. As developed nations have historically contributed more greenhouse gas emissions, they bear responsibility for the increased frequency and severity of natural disasters. Providing debt relief is one way the global community can redress the imbalance and fulfill its responsibility to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change on the most vulnerable countries. Moreover, doing so can also promote global solidarity and cooperation. 4. Long-term Improvements for Disaster Preparedness and Resilience: Debt relief can enable affected countries to enhance their capacities to prepare for, respond to, and recover from natural disasters. With additional funds available, countries could implement comprehensive disaster risk reduction programs, strengthen local capacities for emergency response, and undertake the necessary rebuilding and redevelopment with a focus on resilience. As a result, countries receiving debt relief would be in a better position to face future disasters, reducing the likelihood of needing further financial assistance. In conclusion, proponents of debt relief for countries suffering from natural disasters argue that it is not only a compassionate response to the immediate needs of those affected but also an investment in long-term recovery and resilience. By providing debt relief, the international community can foster unity, address its moral and political obligations, and create a safer and more resilient global society for everyone."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Oystein Aarseth (Norwegian: ['oystein 'os@t]; 22 March 1968 - 10 August 1993), better known by his stage name Euronymous, was a Norwegian guitarist. Euronymous was a founder of and central figure in the early Norwegian black metal scene. He was a co-founder of the Norwegian black metal band Mayhem. He was also founder and owner of the extreme metal record label Deathlike Silence Productions and record shop Helvete. Vikernes was arrested on 19 August 1993 in Bergen. Many other members of the scene, including Blackthorn and Faust, were also taken in for questioning. The trial began on 2 May 1994. At the trial it was claimed that he, Blackthorn and another friend had planned the murder. The third person stayed at the apartment in Bergen as an alibi. To make it look like they never left Bergen, he was to rent films, play them in the apartment, and withdraw money from Vikernes' credit card. On 16 May 1994, Vikernes was sentenced to 21 years in prison (Norway's maximum penalty) for the murder of Euronymous, the arson of three churches, the attempted arson of a fourth church, and for the theft and storage of 150 kg of explosives. However, he only confessed to the latter. Two churches were burnt the day he was sentenced, \\"presumably as a statement of symbolic support\\". Blackthorn was sentenced to 8 years in prison for being an accomplice. At Euronymous' funeral, Hellhammer (Mayhem's then-drummer) and Necrobutcher (Mayhem's former bassist) decided to continue with the band and worked on releasing the De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas album. Before the release, Euronymous' family asked Hellhammer to remove the bass tracks recorded by Vikernes. Hellhammer said: \\"I thought it was appropriate that the murderer and victim were on the same record. I put word out that I was re-recording the bass parts, but I never did\\". The album, which has Euronymous on electric guitar and Vikernes on bass guitar, was finally released in May 1994. A part of the Norwegian scene considered Vikernes a traitor for murdering Euronymous and turning his back on Satanism in favor of nationalism and Odinism, although Vikernes claims he was never a Satanist and had only used 'Satan' to provoke. They saw Euronymous' death as a significant loss to the scene, and some black metallers \\"have sworn to avenge Aarseth's death\\". A few years after the murder, Ihsahn of Emperor said \\"There's no discipline in the scene anymore, like earlier on around the shop\\". After his death, a new generation of musicians tried to gain credibility by 'hyping-up' Euronymous, although he was also hailed as \\"the King\\" or \\"Godfather of Black Metal\\" by bands that had emerged before this new generation. However, many of Euronymous' friends and bandmates \\"speak of the killing with a tone of indifference\\". Lords of Chaos remarks: \\"what is striking [...] is how little they care about the lives or deaths of one another\\". In the book, Hellhammer, Ihsahn and Samoth claim that Euronymous' death did not affect or at least not shock them. Anders Odden (a friend of Euronymous at the time) said of the murder: \\"It wasn't odd that he ended up getting killed. He thought he could threaten to kill people without it having any consequences\\". He added: \\"I think many people felt relief once he was gone\\". Writer and musician Erlend Erichsen agreed, saying \\"Nobody was there to boss them about. The 'black metal police' were gone\\". What does \\"the latter\\" refer to?","completion":"In the given passage, \\"the latter\\" refers to Vikernes' confession to the theft and storage of 150 kg of explosives. When mentioning the charges against Vikernes, the text states, \\"Vikernes was sentenced to 21 years in prison (Norway's maximum penalty) for the murder of Euronymous, the arson of three churches, the attempted arson of a fourth church, and for the theft and storage of 150 kg of explosives. However, he only confessed to the latter.\\" In this context, the latter denotes the last mentioned charge, which is the theft and storage of explosives."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 2: Create a subject for the sentence - I'll consider that the bunch is made up of objects, such as books or fruits, so that it's something tangible and can be related to in terms of filling a shelf. Step 3: Form a verb or action that relates to the concepts - Since fill and shelf are the more action-oriented concepts, I'll use a verb that signifies the action of putting something onto a shelf and filling it. Step 4: Arrange the concepts in the sentence - Start with the subject (bunch), followed by the action (fill), and finally the end position (shelf).

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? spirited film","completion":"The sentiment of the following sentence \\"spirited film\\" can be interpreted as positive for several reasons. It's important to examine the words, context, and possible interpretations in order to provide a detailed and long answer. Firstly, let's break down the sentence into its individual words: 1. \\"spirited\\": This word has several meanings, and in this context, it likely refers to a film that is lively, energetic, or animated. It generally implies enthusiasm, passion, and a strong overall presence, which can be associated with positive emotions and experiences. The word \\"spirited\\" can also suggest a certain level of boldness or courage, as it might be used to describe someone who stands up for their beliefs or fights for a cause. This characteristic is often admired and appreciated, adding to the overall positive sentiment of the sentence. 2. \\"film\\": The term \\"film\\" itself is neutral, as it simply refers to a motion picture or movie. Its connotation depends on the context and the words that surround it. When paired with a positive descriptor like \\"spirited,\\" it amplifies the overall optimistic sentiment. Now, let's consider the possible interpretations of the sentence: 1. If the sentence is an independent statement, it indicates that the speaker or writer is positively describing a film they have watched or heard about. They appreciate the lively, energetic, or animated aspects of the film, which contribute to a positive viewing experience. 2. If the sentence is part of a larger context, for instance in a conversation or a written review, it still conveys a positive sentiment. It suggests that the person is recommending the film or highlighting its positive qualities. In the context of a review, this statement might be followed by more specific observations or examples that support the positive claim. In conclusion, the sentiment of the sentence \\"spirited film\\" is positive, as it alludes to a movie that possesses lively, energetic, or animated qualities that evoke a sense of passion, enthusiasm, and enjoyment for the viewer.

Q: Article: Housing Price in China has always aroused heated discussion among property developers and ordinary Chinese. To many property developers and local government officials, housing price in China is still low compared with many developed countries. However, the average housing price in the United States is only 8, 000 yuan per square metre, while in China, it is even higher than that in the United States. \\"This shows that there are some bubbles in Chinese real estate market,\\" the International Finance News reported. Although the average price of residential houses in the United States, after changed to RMB, is about 8, 000 yuan per square metre, the houses in the US are not sold in terms of building area, as most Chinese property developers do when they sell their houses. If the US property developers sell their houses according to the building area, then the housing price will be even lower than 8, 000 yuan per square metre. In most big Chinese cities, such as Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, houses are sold at a price even higher than those in the US. The high housing price in large cities in China proves that Chinese real estate market does have some bubbles. Moreover, Chinese houses cannot be compared with houses in the US in terms of building quality, environment and supporting facilities. Furthermore, it should be noted that American people's average income is several dozen times higher than that of Chinese people. How can the Chinese afford to buy a house which is even more expensive than that sold in the US? At the beginning of 2007, Chinese government issued a set of policies that aimed to benefit the public. Now in order to reduce the high housing prices, the government can regulate the real estate market by raising tax on property industry and controlling the release of loans and lands to property developers. Meanwhile, the government should allow people to build more houses through various fund-raising channels, such as funds collected from buyers or raised by working units. By applying these multiple means, it is expected that the high housing prices can be lowered and Chinese public can really benefit from the economic achievement.

For my birthday, my parents took me and my brother out of school on the day before my birthday and we took a train. (Funny interjection, my mom was caught on the wrong side of the station so she ran across the rails and was pulled up by my dad a couple minutes before the train came.) It was a night train, so we had our own room where my brother and I claimed the top as our territory.

I quickly got off the train in excitement taking in the view of the station like it was first time I had seen anything. We exited the station and took the trolley to get to our hotel. For breakfast, we had delicious, regional delicacies (among other things). They looked similar to crepes, but all I know is that it had a German name that I can’t remember. After we got situated in our hotel, we immediately headed off for the Mozart Plaza/Park. My family and I also visited other monuments that day: By the end of the day, our legs were worn out. We had rode so many trolleys and walked so much that I’m pretty sure that any longer and we would’ve collapsed on the spot. The bed never felt so good. The following days we went to Austrian Castle, Ice Cave, and more buildings and such. The trip overall made this birthday the most memorable and the best thus far.

I can’t think of anything “funny” I have seen at the zoo exactly although there has to be something…. we used to go to Catskill Game Farm and Bronx Zoo in NY so I am sure there has to have been something notable, if not funny…. At Catskill Game Farm there were Peacocks that walked around free and made startling noises. There were also punk flamingoes there that were amazing to see. Maybe the funniest (not so funny though) thing was in the area where you could feed deer and baby pigs so sometimes they’d all come around at once and mob you? My daughter wanted to feed who she wanted to feed but the deer and the pigs had their own ideas. The deer liked these crackers kind of like rye crisps and the baby pigs went for the bottles of milk or formula. When my daughter tried to pick and choose and just feed one suddenly she would be surrounded by many. I think my husband must have videos of what transpired.

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Ever feel like you've been hit on the head after a bad night's sleep? According to scientists, the thought isn't as unbelievable as it seems. A study found going without sleep for just one night causes changes in the brain similar to those that occur after a blow to the head. The researchers said the healthy young men examined in the study showed a sudden increase in the same chemicals which indicate brain damage. Professor Christian Benedict, of Uppsala University, Sweden, explained that the chemicals NSE and S-100B are biomarkers for brain damage, such as concussion . He said, \\"What we found was their levels in the blood rose in the group that went without sleep for a night. This was not to the extent that would happen after a head injury, for instance, but it was still significant. During sleep, the brain cleans poisonous substances off itself.\\" Benedict also said previous studies which linked a lack of sleep with increased risk of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and multiple sclerosis could applaud his study. The rise of the chemicals in the blood after sleep loss may suggest not getting enough sleep contributes to a loss of brain tissue, he explained. Benedict, whose study is published in the journalSleep, added, \\"In conclusion, the findings of our experiment indicate a good night's sleep may be critical to maintaining brain health.\\" A third of the UK population suffer from sleep-related problems, while the average person now sleeps for only seven hours a night, compared with almost nine a few decades ago.

It's almost TOO light. The entire camera is PLASTIC and has the feeling of a disposable. This would be a 5 star PLUS camera if the body were titanium and it had a bit more heft. I wouldn't reccomend this camera to a friend. I KNOW there are more solid cameras out there. Look for them and don't but this one. Answer: The answer to this question is:","completion":"The tone of this product review is mixed, leaning towards negative. Explanation: The reviewer begins by acknowledging the positive aspect of the product, stating that it delivers great pictures. This introduction sets a moderately positive tone. However, as the review progresses, it becomes increasingly more negative. The next section of the review mentions that a really good camera should have a good, solid feel in the hand, and they criticize the camera's lightness and plastic construction. The reviewer believes the camera feels disposable and compares it unfavorably to higher-quality materials such as titanium. This transition from positive to negative tone adds emphasis to their dissatisfaction with the body of the camera. The reviewer then states that the camera would be a 5-star product if it had a more solid build and weighed more. This implies that they find the camera's performance and picture-taking abilities to be excellent, but the poor build quality undermines its overall value. The negative tone further solidifies when the reviewer explicitly states they wouldn't recommend the camera to a friend and suggests looking for more solid cameras available in the market. Thus, it becomes clear that the negative aspects of the product outweigh the positive ones in the reviewer's opinion. In conclusion, while the review acknowledges the camera's ability to take great pictures, the overwhelmingly negative focus on the build quality and overall dissatisfaction with the product suggests that the tone of the review is mixed, leaning towards negative."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Jingning She Autonomous County in Lishui is the only She autonomous county in China. What is the answer to this question: What varieties of Chinese do the largest Han subgroup speak?","completion":"The largest Han subgroup, which consists of the majority of the population, primarily speaks the Wu varieties of Chinese. The Wu language group is a subdivision of the wider Sino-Tibetan language family and belongs to the Han Chinese languages category. This linguistic classification has its origins in the ancient region of Wu, which now corresponds to present-day areas including Shanghai, southern Jiangsu Province, eastern Zhejiang Province, and the southern part of Anhui Province. The Wu varieties of Chinese are spoken by millions of people, and these dialects exhibit significant diversity in terms of pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary. Some of the most well-known Wu dialects include Shanghainese, Suzhounese, Wenzhounese, and Ningboese. These dialects are not entirely mutually intelligible with Mandarin, which is the official language of the People's Republic of China, giving the Wu dialects a distinct linguistic identity. As a result, the largest Han subgroup, which mainly speaks the Wu dialects, plays a significant role in shaping the linguistic landscape of China. In addition to the Wu languages, this diverse population of Han Chinese also contributes to the rich tapestry of other regional languages, such as Hakka, Yue (Cantonese), and Min, that are spoken across the country. Moreover, the article mentions that there are around 400,000 members of ethnic minorities within the region, which includes roughly 200,000 She people and about 20,000 Hui Chinese. The Jingning She Autonomous County in Lishui represents the only She autonomous county in the entirety of China.

In 1898 the RCM offered Holst a further year's scholarship, but he felt that he had learned as much as he could there and that it was time, as he put it, to \\"learn by doing\\". Some of his compositions were published and performed; the previous year The Times had praised his song \\"Light Leaves Whisper\\", \\"a moderately elaborate composition in six parts, treated with a good deal of expression and poetic feeling\\".Occasional successes notwithstanding, Holst found that \\"man cannot live by composition alone\\"; he took posts as organist at various London churches, and continued playing the trombone in theatre orchestras. In 1898 he was appointed first trombonist and répétiteur with the Carl Rosa Opera Company and toured with the Scottish Orchestra. Though a capable rather than a virtuoso player he won the praise of the leading conductor Hans Richter, for whom he played at Covent Garden. His salary was only just enough to live on, and he supplemented it by playing in a popular orchestra called the \\"White Viennese Band\\", conducted by Stanislas Wurm.Holst enjoyed playing for Wurm, and learned much from him about drawing rubato from players. Nevertheless, longing to devote his time to composing, Holst found the necessity of playing for \\"the Worm\\" or any other light orchestra \\"a wicked and loathsome waste of time\\". Vaughan Williams did not altogether agree with his friend about this; he admitted that some of the music was \\"trashy\\" but thought it had been useful to Holst nonetheless: \\"To start with, the very worst a trombonist has to put up with is as nothing compared to what a church organist has to endure; and secondly, Holst is above all an orchestral composer, and that sure touch which distinguishes his orchestral writing is due largely to the fact that he has been an orchestral player; he has learnt his art, both technically and in substance, not at second hand from text books and models, but from actual live experience.\\"With a modest income secured, Holst was able to marry Isobel; the ceremony was at Fulham Register...

Balanini pirates, fervent Muslims, disputed the coast of northeastern Borneo (modern Sabah) with the sultanate of Brunei. Sarawak's coast and jungle interior were controlled by the Iban — Sea Dayak pirates and Land Dayak slash-and-burn farmers. (The Dayaks practiced head-hunting, a ritual that was believed to bring spiritual energy to their communities. ) The region was unproductive and without great resources, except for the Sarawak river valley, where the Chinese mined for gold and antimony. Brunei chiefs traded the metals through Americans in Singapore. In 1839, the governor of Singapore sent James Brooke (1803–1868) to promote trade links with the Sultan of Brunei. He had been an audacious cavalry officer in the Anglo-Burmese wars and now exploited the situation for his own benefit. In exchange for helping the regent end a revolt of uppity Malay chiefs, Brooke was made Rajah of Sarawak in 1841, with his capital in Kuching (founded by the Malays just 11 years earlier). He tried to halt the Dayaks' piracy and head-hunting while defending their more \\"morally acceptable\\" customs. His attempts to limit the opium trade met with resistance by the Chinese in Bau, who revolted. His counter-attack with Dayak warriors drove the Chinese out of Bau and across the Sarawak border. Thereafter, Chinese settlement was discouraged and did not achieve the commercial dominance it enjoyed on the peninsula. In 1863, Brooke retired to Britain, handing Sarawak over to his nephew Charles. More reserved and remote but a better administrator and financier than his uncle, Charles Brooke imposed on his men his own austere, efficient style of life. He brought Dayak leaders onto his ruling council but favored the time-honored colonial practice of divide-and-rule by pitting one tribe against another to keep the peace. Northeast Borneo (Sabah) was \\"rented\\" from the Sultan of Brunei by British businessman Alfred Dent. Dent was operating a royal charter for the British North Borneo Company — a charter similar to that of the EIC.

Q:Information: - The FAL, or Fusil Automatique Léger (\\"Light Automatic Rifle\\"), is a semi-automatic/selective fire battle rifle produced by the Belgian armaments manufacturer Fabrique Nationale de Herstal (FN). During the Cold War it was adopted by many North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries, with the notable exception of the United States. It is one of the most widely used rifles in history, having been used by more than 90 countries. - The CAL ( Carabine Automatique Légère ) was a Belgian weapon manufactured by Fabrique Nationale . It was the first 5.56 mm rifle produced by the Fabrique Nationale . It resembled the company 's highly successful FN FAL , but was an original design . Unlike the FAL , it was a market failure , although its development led to the reasonably successful FN FNC . - Fabrique Nationale d'Herstal (French for: National Factory of Herstal) self identified as FN Herstal and often referred to as Fabrique Nationale or simply FN is a leading firearms manufacturer located in Herstal, Belgium, and is owned by the holding company Herstal Group which is owned by the regional government of Wallonia. It is currently the largest exporter of military small arms in Europe. - The Cold War was a state of political and military tension after World War II between powers in the Eastern Bloc (the Soviet Union and its satellite states) and powers in the Western Bloc (the United States, its NATO allies and others). Historians do not fully agree on the dates, but a common timeframe is the period (the second half of the 20th century) between 1947, the year the Truman Doctrine (a U.S. policy pledging to aid nations threatened by Soviet expansionism) was announced, and 1991, the year the Soviet Union collapsed. - The FN FNC (French: \\"Fabrique Nationale Carabine\\") is a 5.56×45mm NATO assault rifle developed by the Belgian arms manufacturer FN Herstal and introduced in the late 1970s. - The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO '), also called the North Atlantic Alliance, is an intergovernmental military alliance based on the North Atlantic Treaty which was signed on 4 April 1949. The organization constitutes a system of collective defence whereby its member states agree to mutual defence in response to an attack by any external party. Three NATO members are permanent members of the United Nations Security Council with the power to veto and are officially nuclear-weapon states: the United States, France and the United Kingdom. NATO's headquarters are located in Haren, Brussels, Belgium, where the Supreme Allied Commander also resides. Belgium is one of the 28 member states across North America and Europe, the newest of which, Albania and Croatia, joined in April 2009. An additional 22 countries participate in NATO's Partnership for Peace program, with 15 other countries involved in institutionalized dialogue programmes. The combined military spending of all NATO members constitutes over 70% of the global total. Members' defence spending is supposed to amount to 2% of GDP. - A battle rifle is a military service rifle that fires a full-power rifle cartridge, such as 7.62×51mm NATO, 7.62×54mmR, 7.92x57mm Mauser, .303 British, or .30-06 Springfield. Compared to assault rifles and their intermediate cartridges, the higher-caliber rounds provide greater power and range, though they have greater weight and produce stronger recoil, making them less than ideal for fully automatic fire.

Ditto the condominium and cooperative apartment. Swapping houses for vacation purposes is hardly a new phenomenon. Those who operate as intermediaries in such exchanges say that they are constantly growing. This is the time of year when arrangements for the summer months are normally set in motion. Accordingly, Americans across the country who are familiar with the process are deep into an examination of the possibilities. The choices are broad, ranging from city apartments to castles in Spain, cottages in Ireland, and seaside villas in the Canary Islands or the Bahamas. Judy and Francis Furton, retired schoolteac hers from Detroit who now live in Guadalajara, Mexico, are a couple with long experience inhouse swaps. They have been exchanging with h omeowners in the United States and overseas for 20 years, they said b y telephone from Guadalajara, and this year they plan to swap again. They have b een to Britain, Greece, Jamaica, Bermuda, Venezuela and Hawaii and mo re. Their one-story three-bedroom house in Guadalajara comes with ma id and car - ''Mexican charm with American comfort,'' asthe Furtons p ut it in the home exchange directory. ''Your home is safer with people in it,'' says Mr. Furton, ''and think of all the money you are saving.'' The Furtons list their house in a catalogue prepared jointly by the Vacation Exchange Club, whose offices are at 350 Broadway in Manhattan; the Holiday Home Exchange of Milsons Point, Australia, and the Hawaii Home Interchange in Honolulu. These organizations in turn are affiliated with about 20 other exchange organizations in Europe, including Intervac International and The Directory Group. Over the years a number of similar organizations have been formed in this country and disbanded. The Vacation Exchange Club, founded in 1960, charges an annual membership fee of 21. Members get catalogues in February and April listing the properties available for swaps. A member joining this month, for example, would get both catalogues, but his own home would be listed, assuming a listing were wanted, only in the April catalogue. House exchanges are also arranged through listings posted on bulletin boards at schools and churches, and through classified advertisements in newspapers or magazines distributed in the area people want to visit. The enthusiasts see many advantages. Other people's houses can serve as a comfortable base, they say, from which to explore new areas or to visit friends and relatives without burdening them. The traveler saves hotel bills and the expense of constantly eating out. The uninitiated, however, remain uncertain about letting strangers into their homes. They worry about damage to furnishings and whether the house and car will be adequately covered by insurance. They also wonder whether they would find the house as clean when they return as it was when they left it. ''Relax and have a good time,'' was the advice from the Furtons, who said that with proper preparation, the rest will take care of itself. The Vacation Exchange Club catalogue contains about 6,000 listings, about a third of them in the United States. One recent catalogue, for example, included a large home on 10 acres with garden, pool and tennis courts in the Lower Blue Montains of West Sydney, Australia, owned by a medical specialist; an apartment in Hong Kong with a view of Hong Kong Harbor and the Lowloon Mountains of China, owned by a Union Carbide executive; a remote field cottage in County Cork, Ireland, owned by a duke, and a summer cottage on the ocean in Newport, R.I. David Ostroff, founder and president of the club, emphasizes that the home exchange service is not a real estate, rental or travel agency. ''We only publish and distribute this directory,'' he said. ''We cannot be responsible for the homes, the actions of subscribers or the accuracy of the listings,'' he said. ''On the other hand, since 1960 we have received only a handful of complaints from the thousands who have exchanged.'' He said it would be ''dishonest of us to pretend that exchangers face no risks.'' But the actual dangers are not those that beginners usually expect, he said. There are few instances of property damage or theft, he said. The most frequent complaints arise from differences in housekeeping standards. Less frequent but more serious are reports that some exchangers disappoint their correspondents by withdrawing from apparently firm commitments. A trusting, friendly relationship can be built long before the exchange begins, he said. This is done through letters, tape recordings or telephone calls, which are helpful in personalizing the relationship. Mr. Ostroff also advises people to find out whether their vehicle insurance is adequate, and whether any permits are required, when people are also exchanging the use of cars, boats or other recreational vehicles. Exchangers should be covered, as would any other guest in the house or any friend who uses the family car or other property. He is full of additional tips to the novice: Find out what is covered by insurance in the home being visited; if not meeting the guests beforehand, arrange for keys to be collected from and returned to a third party; lock away valuable or fragile ornaments; leave plenty of closet and drawer space for guests. And don't forget to ask friends and neighbors to welcome the guests, guide them and make them feel at home. As Mr. Ostroff sees it, the house itself is the least important part of it. It's a cross-cultural experience, he says, ''different from what you would have if you stayed at the Dusseldorf Hilton.'' One point of ten made by exchangers is that people living in locations fav ored by travelers have an easier time finding an exchange part ner. Thus, people living in and near the New York area are often in a good position to make swaps. After 50 exchange experiences, Judy and Francis Furton are also mines of information on what the well-prepared swapper should know. They advise, first of all, flexibility. As to time, ''be as flexible as your employment and holiday schedule permit.'' As to place, ''decide on dozens of places, not just one.'' They say the swapper should make the house easy for the stranger to live in. Start by preparing a loose-leaf notebook with instructions on using appliances and other equipment. Leave city and area maps. Tell the visitor how to find stores, repair shops, services of all kinds. Recommend restaurants. Leave telephone numbers for services of all types - insurance agent, doctor, dentist, helpful neighbors and baby-sitters. The Furtons said they usually paid the utility bills when exchangers were using their house - except for long-distance telephone calls. They also said that repair bills were usually paid by the owner, but an unexpected major repair is cleared with a telephone call or cable before work is begun. Exchangers agree in advance who will pay for yard care, maid service or cleaning help. The Furtons say their experience with the cleanliness issue is that standards vary. ''The exchange home may not be as clean as you keep your own,'' Mrs. Furton says. ''Even worse, you may have exchanged with a very fussy housekeeper who thinks your home isn't clean.'' If there are complaints, she says, write a letter to the exchange partner expressing the grievance in detail. Then burn it. ''You'll feel much better,'' she said.

Please tell me if those questions are the same. OPT: *no. *yes.","completion":"The questions are not the same. The best sniper rifle in WW2: During World War II, there were several sniper rifles used by various countries, but one of the most effective ones was the Soviet Mosin-Nagant 91/30 PU sniper rifle. It earned the reputation of being one of the best sniper rifles at that time due to several reasons: 1. Accuracy: The Mosin-Nagant 91/30 PU was known for its remarkable accuracy, which was essential for a sniper rifle. It used the 7.62x54mmR cartridge, a highly potent and accurate round. 2. Range: The effective range of the Mosin-Nagant 91/30 PU was between 800 and 1,000 meters, allowing Soviet snipers to engage targets at considerable distances. When equipped with a PU scope, it offered a 3.5x magnification, making it easier for snipers to focus on their targets. 3. Reliability: The Mosin-Nagant 91/30 PU sniper rifle was known for its robust design, making it capable of withstanding the harsh conditions encountered on the Eastern Front, including freezing temperatures and mud. 4. Production: The Mosin-Nagant had been in production since the late 19th century, making it widely available during WW2. The Soviets could readily produce and supply these sniper rifles to their troops in substantial numbers. 5. Skilled operators: Soviet snipers, such as Vasily Zaytsev and Lyudmila Pavlichenko, were highly trained and proved the effectiveness of the Mosin-Nagant 91/30 PU in combat, with many of them achieving over 200 confirmed kills. Why some snipers prefer bolt-action rifles: Bolt-action rifles remain popular choices among snipers and marksmen due to several reasons: 1. Accuracy: Bolt-action rifles are known for their excellent accuracy because of the rigid and sturdy design of their lock-up mechanism. This ensures that there is minimal movement of the components during the firing process, ultimately leading to consistent and precise shots. 2. Reliability: Bolt-action rifles have few moving parts, which reduces the chance of mechanical failure. This simplicity also makes them more resistant to dirt, grime, and harsh environmental conditions, ensuring that they remain functional when needed. 3. Recoil management: Bolt-action rifles allow the shooter to have more control over the recoil, as they manually cycle the bolt, enabling better follow-up shots. This is particularly helpful for snipers who need to make rapid, consecutive shots while maintaining accuracy. 4. Noise reduction: Bolt-action rifles often produce less noise than semi-automatic rifles due to the absence of a cycling action during firing. This aspect is critical for maintaining stealth in sniper operations. 5. Ammunition versatility: Bolt-action rifles can be adapted to use various calibers without compromising the weapon's reliability. This makes them suitable for different types of engagements and enables the sniper to choose the appropriate ammo for their particular situation. While both questions pertain to sniper rifles, they address different aspects: the first question seeks to identify the best sniper rifle used during WW2, and the second question asks why snipers might prefer bolt-action rifles in general."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

CONTEXT: Filantropía y sostenibilidad ambiental En septiembre de 2009, Watson anunció su asociación con la marca de moda People Tree, una marca de moda de comercio justo, trabajando como «asesora creativa» para crear una línea de ropa de primavera, que fue lanzada en el 2010; esta contenía estilos inspirados por el sur de Francia y la ciudad de Londres. La colección fue descrita por The Times como «muy inteligente»; Watson comentó que «la moda es una gran manera de capacitar a las personas y darles destrezas, en vez de dar dinero a la caridad puedes ayudar a la gente comprando los diseños que hacen y así apoyar lo que los enorgullece». Continuó su participación en People Tree con la colección otoño/invierno 2010. En 2009, Watson colaboró gratuitamente con dicha marca para ser la imagen y la estilista de una colección de ropa ecológica, con el fin de recaudar fondos para la People Tree Fundation.

The answer to the question: Why did Milo leave the band the last time? is inside the article: The film begins with the Descendents' origins in the neighboring communities of Hermosa Beach and Manhattan Beach, California in the late 1970s. Middle school friends Frank Navetta and Dave Nolte start the band in 1977 by writing songs together on guitar. Classmate Bill Stevenson impresses them with his musical talents and becomes their drummer. In 1979 they meet bassist Tony Lombardo in Long Beach and recruit him to the band. Nolte bows out to join his brothers in The Last, and Navetta, Stevenson, and Lombardo record the Descendents' debut single. Stevenson's high school classmate Milo Aukerman joins the band as lead singer, and the new lineup builds a local following through their catchy and melodic songs, energetic live shows, and Aukerman's image as a nerd. They release the Fat EP (1981) and their debut album Milo Goes to College (1982), so named because Aukerman leaves the band to study biology. Stevenson drums in Black Flag for the next few years. In 1985 the Descendents reconvene for a second album, I Don't Want to Grow Up. Navetta has burned all of his equipment and moved to Oregon, and is replaced by Ray Cooper. Stevenson pushes for the band to tour, but Lombardo declines and quits. He is replaced by Doug Carrion, and this lineup records 1986's Enjoy!, after which Cooper and Carrion both leave the band. Stevenson recruits bassist Karl Alvarez from Salt Lake City, who brings in his close friend Stephen Egerton to play guitar. The new lineup releases the 1987 album All, themed around the philosophical concept of \\"All\\" invented by Stevenson and friend Pat McCuistion. Aukerman leaves the band again to attend graduate school., can you guess it ?","completion":"Milo Aukerman, the lead singer of the Descendents, left the band the last time to attend graduate school. He had previously left the band to study biology when the band released their debut album, Milo Goes to College (1982).

Trevor: I saw the notification, but I haven't listened to it yet. You know I'm more of a Cardi B fan! I think she's way better than Nicki Minaj. Jay: Really? I respect Cardi B, but I personally think Nicki Minaj has more versatility and her lyrics are much more creative. Plus, she's been in the industry for a long time, making her a true rap icon. Trevor: Yeah, but Cardi B has shown a lot of growth since she started! She really knows how to create catchy hooks and her flow is just great. She's also not afraid to be herself, which I think is a major plus. Jay: True, Cardi B has a unique style and bold personality. However, don't you think Nicki Minaj is more consistent with her work? Her discography is more diverse, and you can't deny her multiple hit songs and features over the years. Trevor: Sure, she's had plenty of hits, but I think the reason I prefer Cardi B is that she comes across as more genuine. She's always been open about her past, both the good and the bad, and how she's worked hard to get to where she is now. That's something I really respect. Jay: I do admire Cardi B's authenticity, but don't you think Nicki Minaj's experience in the industry has given her a unique perspective that's reflected in her music? Also, her ability to switch up her style from rap to pop and still be successful in both genres is quite impressive. Trevor: Cardi B has also experimented with different genres. Plus, in a shorter amount of time, she achieved a lot of milestones, like her debut album, 'Invasion of Privacy,' which broke records and won a Grammy for Best Rap Album. She's managed to accomplish a lot in just a few years. Jay: That's true, and Cardi B's impact on the industry is undeniable. However, Nicki Minaj has had a much longer career and has also been nominated for multiple Grammys. And not to mention, she's an amazing lyricist who has inspired both male and female rappers alike. Trevor: While it's true that Nicki Minaj is a trendsetter and has been around longer, I still believe Cardi B has the potential to surpass her over time. Cardi's raw talent, distinct style, and genuine personality resonate more with me, and I can't wait to see her grow even more as an artist. Jay: Well, it's clear that we have our own preferences, and that's the beauty of music and art - there's something for everyone. I still prefer Nicki Minaj, but I can appreciate what Cardi B brings to the table as well. It's always great to have a healthy debate about our favorite artists! Trevor: Definitely! I'm glad we can have such open and honest discussions about our musical tastes, and who knows, maybe there will be a collaboration between Nicki Minaj and Cardi B one day that we will both love! Jay: Hey, you never know! That would definitely be interesting to see. But, until then, let's just enjoy their individual work and keep supporting the artists we admire.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person who was able to secure occasional commissions to compose theatrical works for the Gonzaga court?, using the article: (English: \\"The Marriage of Thetis\\") After Duke Vincenzo's death in February 1612, Monteverdi found himself out of favour at the Mantuan court. Vincenzo's successor Francesco had no high regard for Monteverdi, and dismissed him from his post. Upon Francesco's sudden death in December 1612, the dukedom passed to his brother Ferdinando, but Monteverdi was not recalled to the court and was appointed maestro di capella in August 1613 at St Mark's, Venice. However, he remained in contact with Striggio and other highly placed Gonzaga courtiers, through whom he was able to secure occasional commissions to compose theatrical works for the Gonzaga court. Thus, late in 1616, Striggio asked him to set to music Scipione Agnelli's libretto Le nozze di Tetide, as part of the celebrations for Duke Ferdinando's forthcoming marriage to Catherine de' Medici. This story, based on the wedding of the mythical Greek hero Peleus to the sea-goddess Thetis, had previously been offered to the Mantuan court by Peri, whose setting of a libretto by Francesco Cini had been rejected in 1608 in favour of L'Arianna.Initially, Monteverdi had little enthusiasm for Le nozze di Tetide, and sought ways of avoiding or delaying work on it. He would accept the commission, he informed Striggio on 9 December 1616, because it was the wish of the duke, his feudal lord. However, the verses he was given were not, he felt, conducive to beautiful music. He found the tale difficult to understand, and did not think he could be inspired by it. In any event he was occupied for most of December in writing a Christmas Eve mass for St Mark's. On 29 December, perhaps hoping that the commission would be withdrawn, Monteverdi told Striggio that he was ready to begin work on Le Nozze di Tetide \\"if you tell me to do so\\". In January 1617, however, he became more enthusiastic on learning that the project had been scaled down and was now being projected as a series of intermedi. He informed Striggio that what he had first considered a rather monotonous piece he now thought..., what would be the answer ? A:","completion":"The last name of the person who was able to secure occasional commissions to compose theatrical works for the Gonzaga court is Monteverdi. Claudio Monteverdi maintained contact with Striggio and other Gonzaga courtiers, which allowed him to receive these commissions, such as the composition of Le nozze di Tetide for the celebration of Duke Ferdinando's upcoming marriage to Catherine de' Medici."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is this review positive or negative?","completion":"This review is positive. The user specifically mentions that the food is \\"delicious,\\" expressing overall satisfaction with the taste and quality. In addition, they point out two specific items from the menu, which are the Wilson burger and the pulled pork sandwich, labeling them as their \\"favorites\\". This further strengthens the positive nature of the review as it shows that the user not only enjoyed the overall food experience but also had signature items they particularly loved. Furthermore, word choices like 'favorites' and 'delicious' connote a strong sense of approval and satisfaction, which are indicative of a positive review. The reviewer does not mention any negative elements such as bad service, high prices, low quality, or unpalatable dishes, which typically feature in negative reviews. Although without more context or further elaboration, and recognizing that reviews can be very subjective, it remains safe to assume that this is a positive review. The customer’s choices of words showed positivity, and they are promoting two of the products thereby recommending them to others. Finally, in judging customer reviews, it's also essential to remember that tone, context, and relative comparison to other products or experiences can also affect the analysis.

I attended a boarding school for badly behaved children and it had its fair share of bullies who had been expelled from mainstream schools. But this particular bully had even the teachers running scared. When he went off on one, it could take up to four teachers or members of care staff to get him under control. On my first night at boarding school, he stamped on someone’s face and left them permanently disfigured. I never saw anything that bad again but it stayed with me and I could never sleep properly in that school again. On another occasion, it blew up and there were several members of staff restraining him when he farted. To see the teachers all moaning and groaning and huffing and puffing whilst trying to hold him down was hilarious, literally tears in their eyes. He was unpredictable and he didn’t care. I once saw him swing a hammer at another pupil and throw snooker balls at another, and he used to punch as if he was throwing something, so it would result in a painful blow. Eventually, the staff couldn’t cope with him as they were just as scared as we were. He was removed from the school and placed in a secure unit. The night he left, several of us cried with relief. Last year, I was reading an article in a newspaper when a name caught my eye. It seems he became a hopeless heroin addict at some point and had died in his flat on an overdose of prescription drugs and smack. I felt sad when I read it but I couldn’t work out why. Maybe it was because my brother died in the same manner? He was certainly a character, an absolute nutter and ruthless bully who had everyone fearing him.

After the 1994 release of The Downward Spiral, the live band embarked on the Self-Destruct tour in support of the album. Chris Vrenna and James Woolley performed drums and keyboards respectively, Robin Finck replaced Richard Patrick on guitar and bassist Danny Lohner was added to the line-up. The stage set-up consisted of dirty curtains which would be pulled down for visuals shown during songs such as \\"Hurt\\". The back of the stage was littered with darker and standing lights, along with very little actual ones. The tour debuted the band's grungy and messy image in which they would come out in ragged clothes slathered in corn starch. The concerts were violent and chaotic, with band members often injuring themselves. They would frequently destroy their instruments at the end of concerts, attack each other, and stage-dive into the crowd.The tour included a set at Woodstock '94 broadcast on Pay-per-view and seen in as many as 24 million homes. The band being covered in mud was a result of pre-concert backstage play, contrary to the belief that it was an attention-grabbing ploy, thus making it difficult for Reznor to navigate the stage: Reznor pushed Lohner into the mud pit as the concert began and saw mud from his hair going into his eyes while performing. Nine Inch Nails was widely proclaimed to have \\"stolen the show\\" from its popular contemporaries, mostly classic rock bands, and its fan base expanded. The band received considerable mainstream success thereafter, performing with significantly higher production values and the addition of various theatrical visual elements. Its performance of \\"Happiness in Slavery\\" from the Woodstock concert earned the group a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 1995. Entertainment Weekly commented about the band's Woodstock '94 performance: \\"Reznor unstrings rock to its horrifying, melodramatic core--an experience as draining as it is exhilarating\\".

That is, they only use five pitches per octave in contrast to a heptatonic (seven note) scale, such as the major scale. At first listen, Somali music might be mistaken for the sounds of nearby regions such as Ethiopia, Sudan or Arabia, but it is ultimately recognizable by its own unique tunes and styles.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: Where was the man who's musical career was interrupted in 1896 principal conductor in 1907? from the following article ? Monteux's first high-profile conducting experience came in 1895, when he was barely 20 years old. He was a member of the orchestra engaged for a performance of Saint-Saëns's oratorio La lyre et la harpe, to be conducted by the composer. At the last minute Saint-Saëns judged the player engaged for the important and difficult organ part to be inadequate and, as a celebrated virtuoso organist, decided to play it himself. He asked the orchestra if any of them could take over as conductor; there was a chorus of \\"Oui – Monteux!\\". With great trepidation, Monteux conducted the orchestra and soloists including the composer, sight-reading the score, and was judged a success.Monteux's musical career was interrupted in 1896, when he was called up for military service. As a graduate of the Conservatoire, one of France's grandes écoles, he was required to serve only ten months rather than the three years generally required. He later described himself as \\"the most pitifully inadequate soldier that the 132nd Infantry had ever seen\\". He had inherited from his mother not only her musical talent but her short and portly build and was physically unsuited to soldiering.Returning to Paris after discharge, Monteux resumed his career as a violist. Hans Richter invited him to lead the violas in the Bayreuth Festival orchestra, but Monteux could not afford to leave his regular work in Paris. In December 1900 Monteux played the solo viola part in Berlioz's Harold in Italy, rarely heard in Paris at the time, with the Colonne Orchestra conducted by Felix Mottl. In 1902 he secured a junior conducting post at the Dieppe casino, a seasonal appointment for the summer months which brought him into contact with leading musicians from the Paris orchestras and well-known soloists on vacation. By 1907 he was the principal conductor at Dieppe, in charge of operas and orchestral concerts. As an orchestral conductor he modelled his technique on that of Arthur Nikisch, under whose baton he had played, and who was his ideal conductor.

Article: MANCHESTER, England -- Here's some good news that vegetarians can really sink their teeth into: Researchers in UMA Group have developed genetically engineered fruit trees that produce real meat! Fruit from the new Meat Trees, developed by British scientists using the gene technology, is closely like ordinary grape-fruit. But when you cut the fruit open, inside is fresh beef! \\"Our trees may sound like something out of a science fiction movie, but it's really true,\\" declares Dr. Vincent, director of the UMA Group, which created the amazing trees. \\"Vegetarians have been complaining for years that in spite of their firm belief against eating meat, they still desire the taste of meat once in a while. Now they can have their cake and eat it too.\\" Although it's taken 12 years to develop the trees, the idea is simple. \\"We take the genes from cattle and put them into the cells of grape-fruit trees,\\" Dr. Vincent says. \\"When the seeds grow into trees, they produce meat instead of ordinary fruit. You get the taste -- even the smell.\\" Those who've tried the meat agree it tastes like the real thing. \\"I was a bit unwilling to believe at first when I sank my teeth into a hamburger after they told me it grew on a tree,\\" says Londoner Mark, who took part in a taste-test. \\"But it was juicy and delicious - nothing leafy about it at all.\\" Meat Tree products could be on the market in Great Britain by the end of next year. Some vegetarians insist they should never eat meat -- even if it grew on a tree. Others love the idea. \\"My mouth is watering already,\\" says a devoted vegetarian of 20 years.

Movie title: The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance Movie plot: Senator Ransom \\"Ranse\\" Stoddard (James Stewart) and his wife Hallie (Vera Miles) arrive by train in the frontier town of Shinbone, in an unnamed western state, to attend the funeral of Tom Doniphon (John Wayne). As they make their way toward the undertaker's establishment to pay their respects to the deceased, a reporter (Joseph Hoover) and his editor, Maxwell Scott (Carleton Young) approach and ask Stoddard to explain why a United States Senator would make the long journey from Washington just to attend the funeral of a local rancher. Stoddard's story flashes back 25 years to his arrival in Shinbone as a young, idealistic attorney. His stagecoach is robbed by a gang of outlaws led by Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin). When Stoddard takes Valance to task for robbing a widow of her heirloom, he is brutally whipped and left for dead. When Doniphon finds and brings him into town, restaurant owner Peter Ericson (John Qualen), his wife Nora (Jeanette Nolan), and employee Hallie tend to his injuries, and explain that Shinbone's townsfolk are regularly victimized by Valance. Link Appleyard (Andy Devine), the town marshal, has neither the courage nor the gunfighting skills to challenge Valance; Doniphon (who loves Hallie and plans to ask her to marry him) is the only man willing to stand up to him. When Stoddard, the naive \\"pilgrim\\" (as Doniphon dubs him), opens a law practice in town, Doniphon and many others believe him crazy for inviting retribution from Valance, who cannot abide any challenge to his \\"authority\\". Force, Doniphon explains, is the only thing Valance understands; he advises Stoddard to either flee the territory or buy a gun. Stoddard maintains he will do neither; he is an advocate for justice under the law, not brute force. He earns the town's respect by refusing to knuckle under to Valance, and by founding a school to teach reading and writing to illiterate townspeopleâincluding Hallie. When Dutton Peabody (Edmond O'Brien), publisher of the local newspaper, offers him a revolver, however, he accepts...

(CBS SF) SAN FRANCISCO (KCBS) — KCBS has learned that Saint Mary’s Cathedral, the principal church of the Archdiocese of San Francisco, has installed a watering system to keep the homeless from sleeping in the cathedral’s doorways. UPDATE: Archdiocese Apologizes, Will Remove Anti-Homeless Sprinkler System The cathedral, at Geary and Gough, is the home church of the Archbishop. There are four tall side doors, with sheltered alcoves, that attract homeless people at night. “They actually have signs in there that say, ‘No Trespassing,’” said a homeless man named Robert. But there are no signs warning the homeless about what happens in these doorways, at various times, all through the night. Water pours from a hole in the ceiling, about 30 feet above, drenching the alcove and anyone in it. The shower ran for about 75 seconds, every 30 to 60 minutes while we were there, starting before sunset, simultaneously in all four doorways. KCBS witnessed it soak homeless people, and their belongings. “We’re going to be wet there all night, so hypothermia, cold, all that other stuff could set in. Keeping the church clean, but it could make people sick,” Robert said. The water doesn’t really clean the area. There are syringes, cigarette butts, soggy clothing and cardboard. There is no drainage system. The water pools on the steps and sidewalks. A neighbor who witnessed the drenching told KCBS, “I was just shocked, one because it’s inhumane to treat people that way. The second thing is that we are in this terrible drought. READ MORE: SF Spends 3 Million Cleaning Up After Homeless Jennifer Friedenbach, executive director of the Coalition on Homeless said, “It’s very shocking, and very inhumane. There’s not really another way to describe it. Certainly not formed on the basis of Catholic teachings.” A cathedral staff member confirmed to KCBS the system was installed, perhaps a year ago, to deter the homeless from sleeping there. Chris Lyford, a spokesman for the Archdiocese, said cathedral staff tries hard to help these people. “We refer them, mostly to Catholic Charities, for example for housing,” Lyford said. “To Saint Anthony’s soup kitchen for food, if they want food on that day. Saint Vincent de Paul if they need clothes.” But he says they keep coming back, and most seem to have serious substance abuse issues. “We do the best we can, and supporting the dignity of each person. But there is only so much you can do.” Some of the homeless bring waterproof gear, even an umbrella, to try to stay dry. Frustrated cathedral employees tell us they don’t have the staff to police the doorways, which are used by churchgoers during services. Lyford, who says he didn’t know about the water system until we showed it to him, admits it doesn’t seem to be an effective deterrent. READ RELATED: Catholic Students Blast Morality Code For Teachers Then, suggests this church neighbor, turn it off. “I would hope that they would stop doing this, both for environmental reasons and for common decency.” KCBS has also learned from a review of city permit records that the system was installed illegally, and may violate water use regulations. RELATED: What To Do If You’re Concerned About A Homeless Person Sleeping In Your Doorway The Archdiocese issued a new statement Wednesday morning about the story, saying the church will address the situation at the Cathedral immediately and will have further comment later in the day.

Throughout history, societies have been continuously evolving, marked by significant changes in technology, culture, and lifestyles. As these alterations occur, people might feel a shift in values and expectations, leading to the assumption that time often influences the way they perceive various aspects of life. However, it is essential to recognize that there is a consistent emphasis on tradition and spirituality in people's lives, regardless of the passage of time. Traditions comprise beliefs, customs, and practices that are passed down from generation to generation. They serve as a connection to a community's cultural heritage, ensuring the continuity of shared experiences and fostering a sense of identity. Spirituality, on the other hand, relates to an individual's search for meaning, purpose, and connection. It transcends religious and cultural boundaries and can provide a profound sense of peace and contentment. In times of uncertainty, people often turn to spirituality for comfort, solace, and guidance. As the world continues to change, it is crucial to acknowledge the unwavering role that traditions and spirituality play in sustaining societies and shaping individual values. Despite rapid advancements and shifting priorities, the significance of these cultural elements remains a constant in people's lives.

Context: SEOUL — South Korean Foreign Minister Kang, Kyung-wha said on Wednesday that the U.S. and South Korea jointly made the decision to suspend combined military exercises scheduled for August, but would not confirm if her government was given advanced notice before U.S. President Trump announced his intention to cancel the drills, after he met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore on June 12. “We have made it clear that this is a goodwill gesture to strengthen the dialogue momentum at this point, but they are not irreversible. They could quickly come back should we see the dialogue momentum losing speed or North Korea not living up to its denuclearization commitment,” said Foreign Minister Kang. During a press briefing in Seoul, the foreign minister said she was in in close communication with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the drills directly following the Singapore summit. And while the announcement canceling the exercises came suddenly, Kang said, South Korea was also considering this option to keep diplomatic momentum moving forward following the U.S.-North Korea summit where Kim reaffirmed his commitment to the “complete denuclearization” of North Korea. The now cancelled Ulchi Freedom Guardian exercises normally held in August usually bring in 3,000 more American troops from abroad and involve 50,000 South Korean troops. No decision has yet been made whether the other large-scale joint exercise held in the spring would be suspended as well. At the Singapore summit Trump said he would cancel the “war games” that he said were both enormously expensive and “provocative,” as an act of good faith and in response to North Korea’s commitment to denuclearization, its continued suspension of nuclear and missile teats, and the recent closing of its nuclear testing site. North Korea has long called for the end of these joint military exercises that it says are offensive “rehearsals for war.” In the past U.S. officials refused to suspend the joint drills, that they defended as defensive in nature... Question: How did President Trump enjoy his time in Singapore for the summit?

If a new organism were discovered, which of the following would most likely be used to classify it into the appropriate kingdom? -","completion":"A) Its habitat B) Its appearance C) Its reproductive methods D) Its cellular organization The most appropriate criteria for classifying a newly discovered organism into one of the kingdoms would be: D) Its cellular organization Step 1: Assess the organism's cellular structure Knowing an organism's cellular organization helps identify whether it is prokaryotic or eukaryotic. This distinction divides life forms into two fundamental groups, and is key to proper classification. Step 2: Determine its mode of nutrition Understanding how the organism feeds – whether it produces its own food, absorbs nutrients from the environment, or ingests other organisms – further narrows down its classification. Step 3: Analyze its reproductive methods While several species across kingdoms can share some reproductive methods, assessing this aspect can still help distinguish between certain groups, particularly when used in conjunction with other factors. Step 4: Consider additional characteristics Other factors like habitat or appearance may support the chosen classification, but should not be the primary criteria due to variations within kingdoms. For example, some fungi may resemble plants, but their mode of nutrition and cellular organization would place them in a different kingdom. So, in summary, the cellular organization is the most appropriate characteristic for classifying a new organism because it serves as the fundamental basis for determining its place in the hierarchy of life forms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Over time, this dish has gained popularity in other countries, specifically in Singapore, where it has become a beloved choice for many food enthusiasts. The main ingredient in Ayam penyet is fried chicken, which takes center stage in this delectable meal. A unique aspect of this dish is the term \\"smashed\\" or \\"squeezed\\" fried chicken, which refers to the cooking style where the chicken is marinated, typically with a variety of spices and herbs, then cooked through frying. After frying, the chicken is then \\"smashed\\" or \\"squeezed\\" to make it more tender and to further infuse the flavors from the marinade. This process not only creates a distinctive texture for the chicken but also allows the flavors to be absorbed more deeply. Ayam penyet is traditionally served with a spicy sambal sauce that complements the rich taste of the fried chicken. Sambal is an Indonesian condiment made from a mixture of chili peppers, spices, and other ingredients, which provides a powerful kick of heat and flavor to the dish. This combination of crispy fried chicken and spicy sambal elevates the Ayam penyet and makes it utterly irresistible. The serving temperature for Ayam penyet is hot, which ensures that the flavors are at their peak, and the texture of the chicken remains crisp. This characteristic further enhances the overall dining experience, as the dish's warmth adds an element of satisfaction and comfort. Although originating from Indonesia, Ayam penyet has found a home in Singapore's diverse food landscape. The fusion of cultures and flavors in Singapore has provided a fertile ground for this Indonesian dish to thrive, drawing both locals and visitors alike to indulge in the hearty meal. From humble street food stalls to upscale restaurants, Ayam penyet has emerged as a popular and sought-after dish across the region. In conclusion, Ayam penyet is a flavorful, hearty, and crowd-pleasing Indonesian dish consisting of \\"smashed\\" or \\"squeezed\\" fried chicken served alongside a spicy sambal sauce. Its popularity in Singapore has led to a more significant appreciation for this unique and inviting meal. With its fascinating preparation method, irresistible taste, and comforting serving temperature, Ayam penyet offers a unique and memorable dining experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Ruth Etting (November 23, 1897 - September 24, 1978) was an American singing star and actress of the 1920s and 1930s, who had over 60 hit recordings and worked in stage, radio, and film. Known as \\"America's sweetheart of song\\", her signature tunes were \\"Shine On, Harvest Moon\\", \\"Ten Cents a Dance\\" and \\"Love Me or Leave Me\\". Her other popular recordings included \\"Button Up Your Overcoat\\", \\"Mean to Me\\", \\"Exactly Like You\\" and \\"Shaking the Blues Away\\". As a young girl in Nebraska, Etting had wanted to be an artist; she drew and sketched everywhere she was able. Etting fell in love with her pianist, Myrl Alderman, who was separated from his wife. In January 1938, she began receiving threatening telephone calls from Snyder, who initially claimed Etting withheld assets from him when the divorce settlement was made. Though the couple was divorced, Snyder was also upset because of reports that she was seeing another man. Snyder told Etting that he would come to California and kill her. When Snyder telephoned and found Etting unavailable, he told his daughter Edith that he \\"would fix her ticket, too\\". He called again that evening; this time Etting took the call with her cousin, Arthur Etting, listening on an extension. Etting requested police protection after the telephone call and arranged for private protection. Apparently believing the danger was over when Snyder did not appear soon after his telephone call, Etting released her bodyguards a few days later. On October 15, 1938, Snyder detained Myrl Alderman at a local radio station and forced the pianist to take him to his former wife at gunpoint. In the house at the time were Etting and Edith Snyder. Edith, Snyder's daughter by a previous marriage, worked for Etting and remained living with her after the divorce. Snyder held Etting and Alderman at gunpoint; when told his daughter was in another part of the house, he made Etting call her into the room. Snyder said he intended to kill all three, and told them to be quiet. When Myrl Alderman attempted to speak, Snyder shot him. Snyder then told his ex-wife, \\"I've had my revenge, so you can call the police.\\" Snyder claimed Myrl Alderman pulled a gun and shot at him first and that his ex-wife would not file charges against him because she still loved him. He also claimed he was drunk when he made the telephone threats to Etting in January 1938, saying that at the time his intentions were to kill both his ex-wife and himself. Ruth Etting said that the only gun in the home belonged to her, and after the shooting of Alderman, she was able to go into her bedroom and get it. Upon seeing Etting's gun, Moe Snyder wrested it away from her; it landed on the floor. Snyder's daughter, Edith, picked it up and held it on her father, shooting at him but hitting the floor instead. During a police reenactment of the shooting three days later, Edith Snyder said that she fired at her father to save Ruth Etting, weeping as she continued, \\"I don't yet know whether I am sorry I missed my Dad or whether I am glad\\". Snyder was accused of attempting to murder his ex-wife, his daughter, and Etting's accompanist, Myrl Alderman, the kidnapping of Alderman, as well as California state gun law violations.

Scott Walker supporters claim police raided homes over politics This is a rush transcript from \\"The Kelly File,\\" April 23, 2015. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. MEGYN KELLY, HOST: Well, we have new information tonight on a series of terrifying raids that were reportedly part of a political retribution deal against supporters of Governor Scott Walker. The raids just coming to light after a couple of folks came forward and spoke to National Review writer David French, including this woman, Cindy Archer. Archer says she was asleep in her home one night when she was jolted awake when more than a dozen police officers with a battering ram were yelling and pounding on the door. She says she was trying desperately to calm down her dogs, begging the police not to shoot them. She was afraid, given how angry they appeared. She says police would not say why they were there, but they ransacked her home, grabbed computers and phones and told Ms. Archer she could not tell anyone. And there was much more to this story. Michael Lutz is a decorated retired police officer who many say confirmed these raids were politically motivated, and head of Wisconsin Club for Growth, Eric O'Keefe says the raid victims are guilty of nothing more than exercising their right to support conservative causes. All right. Thank you both so much for being here. So, let me start with you on this, Eric. So, you are affiliated with this conservative group, and you know some of the people who were targeted in these raids. What were -- the police were there on a prosecutor's push and a judge's order, because they were suspected of pushing conservative issues, basically. That's the charge. Just like in the IRS deal, they were being targeted for supporting conservative issues. ERIC O'KEEFE, WISCONSIN CLUB FOR GROWTH: Right. They were being targeted based on a theory which is completely unsupportable under Wisconsin law. But apart from even that, the reality is, as I told my colleagues as soon as I was able to speak to them, you were attacked for your virtue, for your effectiveness, that's why they were attacked. Because the left was tired of losing election after election after election. They correctly identified some of the most important communicators of political messages in Wisconsin and raided their family homes with kids at home. They knew the kids were at home. They knew the schedules. They came in the dark and put aside whether people should have filed different campaign financial reports. Is this an appropriate tactic for any kind of campaign finance question? They already had our e-mails, we subsequently learned. They already had our bank records. They knew what we were doing. We were proud of what we were doing. They didn't ask us. These raids were not really based on any belief that they would find incriminating information. KELLY: And the person at the heart of it is the prosecutor, John Chisolm, and Mike, that's somebody you know well. And this is a man who was married to a union steward who didn't like Scott Walker, who didn't like his policies and certainly didn't like the conservative efforts in Wisconsin. MICHAEL LUTZ, RETIRED MILWAUKEE POLICE OFFICER: That's correct, Megyn. KELLY: And so how were you privy to that information? I mean, what evidence, if any, do you have that it was politically motivated, them going after these conservatives? LUTZ: Sure, I was in a unique position to have some personal conversations with John Chisolm during my time as a police officer. I was working intimately with John on gun crime issues, when I retired from the police department after getting shot, John was a mentor of mine. Good friend of mine. He talked me into going to law school. KELLY: So did he tell you this stuff? I mean, did he admit that he was doing it for political reasons? LUTZ: He did. In a personal conversation in his office, he had stated that he believed it was his personal responsibility to stop Governor Walker and all Republicans from continuing on with Act 10 and supporting Act 10 and Governor Walker. KELLY: Eric, do you -- are you under a secrecy order right now? Because everybody has been told not to speak. O'KEEFE: Yes. An unconstitutional secrecy order. And I'm defying the secrecy order. KELLY: Are you fearful given the tactics we've seen? O'KEEFE: No, I'm not. I would ask them if they want to arrest me to give a phone call and I'll turn myself in. KELLY: You -- the raid victims in this case -- the raid targets in this case were harassed in the middle of the night in front of their children, often in front of their neighbors. Some in the morning when school buses were going by, and little children were seeing families with several police officers there and battering rams, and yet all of them were told keep your mouths shut. You're not allowed to speak of it? O'KEEFE: Right. And the -- and the children were told -- the children were detained from going to school at the appropriate time. Parent asked -- in two cases I know of, what do they tell the school. And they were told to lie, to lie about why they were late. Children's computers were seized with homework on them. And they were told to lie about it. So, you know, the old thing, the dog ate my homework. How does it sound, you know, I lost my computer. Where did you lose it? I don't know. So, there's a little bit of a... KELLY: Are these people going to be sitting there thinking -- and I realize there is this law in Wisconsin that allows supposedly -- it's being challenged -- this secrecy to go on while they're investigating this kind of case, but these people have got to be asking themselves whether this is still the United States of America. O'KEEFE: They did. They were stunned. It was stunning. It's been a stunning attack. And I have sued John Chisolm. He's not fit to serve in public office. I want him removed from office. KELLY: He denies all of this. I mean, he does not -- he says this is legit. They had a judge sign off on it, Mike. He wasn't out there alone they had the cooperation of the courts. LUTZ: But, Megyn, this is why I came forward in the first place, because through the conversations and through what I witnessed in the district attorney's office, John Chisolm had become so hyper political and hyper partisan that he had weaponized his district attorney's office to go after and prosecute and persecute all those who had a different political ideology than him. And that's why I came forward and that's why it's just so disgusting and un-American what's going on here. KELLY: We're going to stay on this. We are very grateful to the two of you for coming on tonight. And again, our offer to John Chisolm to come on and offer his side of the story remains.

As I have stated in prior reviews, I am NOT a Thai food professional! Don't get me wrong, I like Thai food more than I should and I have been on a kick the past few months, but I rarely varie from Pad Thai or Curry. That said, I was EXTREMELY tempted to wonder off my path and attempt a new item or two (but didn't due to a long road trip home and I did NOT want to chance something not sitting right - if you know what I mean). They did screw our order up (wifes curry WAY too spicy for her and my Pad Thai not nearly spicy enough). We just swapped plates and enjoyed each others meals (no complaints from me, I really like spicy curry). The food is good, staff is helpful and friendly. The restaurant is not the nicest I have been in (you can tell from the outside you will not be experiencing fine dinning) - but again, I am not really complaining. The place is clean, just older. My wife and I enjoyed looking at pictures of all the famous people who have enjoyed a meal or two here and even though the place was packed, we got a table quickly and our food came out fast.

Got to have a safe country. We're going to have a safe country.\\" Trump called family members to the presidential lectern to recount how their loved ones had been killed by those who were in the United States illegally. Several of those speaking condemned the media for ignoring the stories of the victims and praised Trump and Vice President Mike Pence for their attention to border security. Crime assertion Trump, in his remarks, also suggested those illegally in the United States commit more crimes on a statistical basis than citizens or resident aliens. However, studies have shown that undocumented immigrants are less likely to commit a crime in the U.S. than native-born citizens, including one published by the libertarian CATO Institute this year. Following intense domestic and international condemnation, Trump on Wednesday signed an order ending his administration's practice of separation of children from their families while parents were being prosecuted for crossing the border illegally. The administration's recently implemented \\"zero tolerence\\" policy led to the criminal prosecutions of undocumented border crossers, which in turn led to federal officials separating adults and their children.

Here are possible answers to this question: - gain weight - wait patiently - stand erect - promise to do - washing dishes I believe the correct choice is \\"washing dishes\\", here's why: The answer to this question is:","completion":"\\"Washing dishes\\". When there are dishes astray in the kitchen, it means that they are not in their proper place or are dirty. The most appropriate action to take in this situation is to wash them. Here's the reasoning for each option: - Gain weight: This option is not related to the situation at hand. Gaining weight is a bodily result of an individual's diet and exercise habits, and it's unrelated to the dishes in the kitchen. - Wait patiently: While this could be a choice if someone else was responsible for washing the dishes, it doesn't actively address the issue of the dishes being astray. It's more of a passive approach and doesn't provide a solution. - Stand erect: This option is unrelated to the issue of dishes in the kitchen. Standing erect refers to a person's posture, which is not connected to washing dishes or organizing them. - Promise to do: This choice is vague and doesn't specifically state what action will be taken. Promises can be broken, and this option doesn't assure that the dishes will actually be dealt with. - Washing dishes: This is the correct option. When there are dishes astray in the kitchen, it's important to clean and put them away in their proper place. Washing the dishes addresses the issue promptly and contributes to maintaining a clean and organized kitchen. In conclusion, when there are dishes astray in the kitchen, the best action to take is washing dishes in order to keep the kitchen clean, organized, and ready for use."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Let's break it down and analyze the premise and hypothesis in detail. Premise: The premise states that there is a man in a colorful outfit with cherries imprinted on the sleeve, pulling a cart with bags. Here, the critical pieces of information are: 1. The man has a colorful outfit. 2. The outfit has cherries imprinted on the sleeve. 3. The man is pulling a cart with bags. Hypothesis: The hypothesis is that the man with the cart is wearing a shirt with a cherry design. To determine if the hypothesis is true based on the premise, we need to evaluate if the information provided in the premise supports the hypothesis. Let's examine the hypothesis in light of the information given in the premise: 1. The man has a colorful outfit - This point does not directly address the cherry design but indicates that the man's outfit is visually striking. It does not, however, conflict with the hypothesis either. 2. The outfit has cherries imprinted on the sleeve - This detail directly addresses the cherry design mentioned in the hypothesis. Since the cherries are imprinted on the sleeve, it is reasonable to assert that the shirt has a cherry design. 3. The man is pulling a cart with bags - This piece of information does not relate to the cherry design but contributes to the overall setup of the scenario. In conclusion, as the premise states that there are cherries imprinted on the sleeve of the man's outfit, and the hypothesis concerns the man wearing a shirt with a cherry design, we can conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true. The information about the colorful outfit and the cart with bags only adds context to the situation, and these details do not conflict with the hypothesis.

Afraid, the boys drive off. Sheriff Wynan returns to the station and tells his deputy Pete (Matt L. Jones) to go and look for the vehicle (but doesn't tell him about what he was doing out on the back road).Meanwhile, the boys arrive at the trailer of the woman who sent out the invitation, Sarah Cooper (Melissa Leo). She encourages them to drink, and after being drugged by the beer, they pass out while undressing. Jared wakes up while being moved in a covered cage. He realizes he is in the sanctuary at Five Points after he identifies Cooper. Here, Cooper begins a long, hate-filled sermon/monologue before his warped followers about sin reeks in the world and that all evil must be eradicated before the end of the world comes which is their one-way ticket into Heaven. Cooper then identifies another captive, a homosexual young man they lured in through an internet chat room. They bind him to a cross using saran wrap and violently execute him with a revolver and drop him into a small crawl space where Travis and Billy Ray are bound together; thus revealing that the Five Points Church is responsible for all the hate...

The United States Capitol, often called the Capitol Building, is the home of the United States Congress, and the seat of the legislative branch of the U.S. federal government. It sits atop Capitol Hill at the eastern end of the National Mall in Washington, D.C. Though not at the geographic center of the Federal District, the Capitol forms the origin point for the District's street-numbering system and the District's four quadrants. The original building was completed in 1800 and was subsequently expanded, particularly with the addition of the massive dome, and expanded chambers for the bicameral legislature, the House of Representatives in the south wing and the Senate in the north wing. Like the principal buildings of the executive and judicial branches, the Capitol is built in a distinctive neoclassical style and has a white exterior. Both its east and west elevations are formally referred to as \\"fronts\\", though only the east front was intended for the reception of visitors and dignitaries. Prior to establishing the nation's capital in Washington, D.C., the United States Congress and its predecessors had met in Philadelphia (Independence Hall and Congress Hall), New York City (Federal Hall), and a number of other locations (York, Pennsylvania; Lancaster, Pennsylvania; Maryland State House in Annapolis, Maryland; and Nassau Hall in Princeton, New Jersey).

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Ashley Collman. The 12-year-old girl who was mauled by a raccoon as a baby is back at home after successfully undergoing surgery to create a new ear. Charlotte Ponce of Spring Lake, Michigan was just three-months-old in 2002 when her young parents left her at home with the pet and she lost her right ear, nose and part of her lip in an attack. Two years ago, Doctor Kongrit Chaiyasate repaired little Charlotte's nose and now he's focusing on giving her a new ear. Going home: Charlotte Ponce, 12, of Spring Lake, Michigan was released from the hospital Monday after undergoing a seven-hour surgery to implant cartilage into her arm. Revolutionary surgery: The lung cartilage was molded into the shape of an ear and inserted into Charlotte's arm during the April 15 surgery. Growing: The cartilage will continue to grow in her arm for the next few months before doctors will attach it to her ear. Pictured above on Monday. One last surgery: Little Charlotte will return to the hospital in June for her surgery, which will hopefully be her last. Pictured above on Monday. 'The raccoon pretty much ate the right side of her face, all the way back to the ear,' Charlotteâ€™s adoptive mom Sharon Ponce told ABCNews.com. 'Now, all she wants is to wear two earrings.' That dream of pierced ears came closer to reality on April 15, when she underwent a seven-hour surgery to embed lung cartilage, shaped into an ear lobe, into her arm where it will continue to grow until June. That's when Charlotte will go under the knife for hopefully the last time as Dr Chaiyaste attaches the cartilage to her ear. Brave: Charlotte Ponce was just three months old when a raccoon chewed off her nose, ear and lips. Pictured above just before she underwent the surgery on April 15. But this last procedure will be the most complex yet, as it is claimed it has only been performed twice before.[. Dr Chaiyasate admitted the procedure is not easy and he will only have one chance to get it right, so he has been practicing on a potato. Dr Chaiyasate, of Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Michigan, told WBIV:. 'As plastic surgeons we need to think outside the box a little bit -. what can we do to make a life long reconstruction for her. 'I've been practicing carving potato last weekend using this as a template. It's not easy.' Mauled: Charlotte Ponce as a baby before and after the attack. Her adopted parents say she is still a happy girl. He said he could not guarantee success, but would try his best. Charlotte's adopted mother Sharon Ponce said people from as far as Britain and Australia had contacted the family to tell them what an inspiration the girl has been. She was just a newborn when her 18-year-old mother and 23-year-old father left her home alone with the pet. The raccoon was thought to have escaped from its cage after a door was left open when food had been dropped in, and no one was there to save the baby when she was attacked. Her great-aunt Sharon and great-uncle Tim only found out about the attack with horror when they watched that night's news bulletin. They gained custody of Charlotte and her brother Marshall, who was then 15 months old, and they and their friends raised more than 10,000 to help pay for her trips in and out of hospital. Sharon had to quit her job at a daycare center to look after Charlotte after doctors said she would need full time care. Although ears have been made out of ribs before, the method of 'growing' the ear inside the forearm is extremely rare. Remarkable: Charlotte with her adopted mother Sharon and Dr Kongkrit Chaiyasate after he built her a new nose in a 2012 operation. He said this next surgery will hopefully be the last major work she has done. Attack: It has been a slow recovery for Charlotte, who lived for a decade without a reconstructed nose. Intact: Charlotte as a baby with her brother Marshall before she was attacked in late 2002. Happy family: Charlotte now lives with (from left) her great-uncle Tim, great-aunt Sharon and brother Marshall. It has to be done because Charlotte's ear was so badly damaged that the foundations of an ear structure no longer exist inside her head. Charlotte previously had a prosthetic ear fitted but it was not an ideal solution and soon became infected and uncomfortable. Yet despite the enormous damage, there is one miracle. Even before the extensive surgery which will grant her a new quality of life, Charlotte's hearing has been largely unaffected. What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"This article is about a 12-year-old girl named Charlotte Ponce who lost her right ear, nose, and part of her lip when she was a baby due to a raccoon attack.

Question: suppose the dishwasher already has detergent happens, how will it affect MORE sunlight arriving at the Earth. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","completion":"To answer this question, we first need to understand the relationship between the events mentioned: 1. The gravity of the Sun pulls its mass inward. 2. There is a lot of pressure on the Sun. 3. The pressure forces atoms of hydrogen to fuse together in nuclear reactions. 4. The energy from the reactions gives off different kinds of light. 5. The light travels to the Earth. 6. The dishwasher already has detergent. 7. MORE sunlight arriving at the Earth. Now let's analyze if there is any connection between these events: The dishwasher having detergent seems completely unrelated to the events 1 to 5 that describe the process of the Sun emitting light. It is an independent event that has no influence on the Sun's behavior or the light reaching the Earth. Now let's consider the effect of event 7 (MORE sunlight arriving at the Earth) on event 2 (There is a lot of pressure on the Sun). More sunlight reaching Earth could be due to changes in the Sun's behavior, such as an increase in solar activity or intensity of electromagnetic radiation. However, it could also be due to changes in the Earth's atmosphere, such as a reduction in air pollution or cloud coverage, which would not affect the pressure on the Sun. Given this information, we can conclude that the dishwasher having detergent has no effect on more sunlight arriving at the Earth. Moreover, the supposed perturbation has no effect on the second effect mentioned (the pressure on the Sun), as it is an independent event with no connection to the solar processes. So, regarding the influence of the supposed perturbation on the second effect mentioned, the answer is: no effect."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

As the group moves, the predator has greater difficulty targeting an individual prey animal. The zebra has been suggested by the zoologist Martin Stevens and his colleagues as an example of this. When stationary, a single zebra stands out because of its large size. To reduce the risk of attack, zebras often travel in herds. The striped patterns of all the zebras in the herd may confuse the predator, making it harder for the predator to focus in on an individual zebra. Furthermore, when moving rapidly, the zebra stripes create a confusing, flickering motion dazzle effect in the eye of the predator. Two packs of lions were hunting large herbivores.

FINAL EXAM Question 1. Hastings is most famous for this battle which was fought in which month of 1066?","completion":"The Battle of Hastings, an event of great historical significance and an essential turning point in English history, occurred on October 14, 1066. This battle is arguably the most famous due to its far-reaching consequences that decisively shaped the future of England and Western Europe. The battle was fought between the armies of the English King Harold Godwinson and the invading Norman forces led by Duke William of Normandy, who later became known as William the Conqueror. The backdrop of this conflict can be traced to the struggles for succession following the death of Edward the Confessor, the King of England, in January 1066. Edward's passing without an heir led to a competition among various claimants to the English throne. Harold Godwinson was named as the successor and crowned king, but Duke William of Normandy, Harald Hardrada of Norway, and other regional nobles all claimed rights to the throne as well. Duke William of Normandy, being closely related to Edward the Confessor and having the Pope's blessing, launched a major invasion force from Normandy and landed on the southern coast of England. Meanwhile, King Harold had to quell a Norse invasion led by Harald Hardrada and his own renegade brother, Tostig Godwinson. The Battle of Stamford Bridge on September 25, 1066, saw the ultimate defeat of the Norse invaders and proved King Harold as a competent military leader. However, Harold's victory was short-lived. Duke William of Normandy landed on the English coast just a few days after the Battle of Stamford Bridge, forcing King Harold to march his exhausted troops southwards to defend against the Normans. As a result, Harold's army had insufficient time to recover and reinforce itself before the pivotal Battle of Hastings. The battle itself was brutal and closely contested. The English, led by King Harold, deployed a defensive shield wall formation, while the Normans, led by Duke William, relied on a mix of infantry, archers, and mounted knights. The fighting endured for an entire day, with both sides sustaining massive casualties. Accounts of the battle suggest that the English line held firmly until a feigned retreat by the Norman troops lured a portion of the English army out of position. This maneuver enabled the Normans to breach the shield wall, thus turning the tide of the battle in their favor. King Harold was killed during the engagement, and his death marked the end of Anglo-Saxon rule in England. Duke William of Normandy ascended to the English throne as William the Conqueror, blending the Norman, English, and French ways of life, languages, and traditions, and ushering in a new era for England. The Battle of Hastings forever changed the course of English history and laid the foundation for the modern nation we know today."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Moreover, several organizations (e.g., The American Society for Microbiology (ASM), American Public Health Association (APHA) and the American Medical Association (AMA)) have called for restrictions on antibiotic use in food animal production and an end to all nontherapeutic uses.[citation needed] However, commonly there are delays in regulatory and legislative actions to limit the use of antibiotics, attributable partly to resistance against such regulation by industries using or selling antibiotics, and to the time required for research to test causal links between their use and resistance to them. Two federal bills (S.742 and H.R. 2562) aimed at phasing out nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in US food animals were proposed, but have not passed.

We went to Casavino yesterday for the \\"wine tasting with snacks\\" per the Deal Chicken coupon we purchased. The coupon got us to try Casavino, but we definitely won't be back. The \\"staff\\" - Jeff (?) & Josh (the J2 on the labels) - were unprofessional and unknowledgeable about the wines that they serve. They informed us half way through our tasting that there were no snacks available on Sundays because the restaurant in the same strip mall where they get their food is closed on Sundays . . . shouldn't this have either (a) been told to us when we made our reservation, or (b) perhaps they could have made other arrangements to serve their patrons on Sundays? Most of the wines were unremarkable. The whites were all super sweet, and most of the reds tasted alike. One of the only interesting wines that we tried was their white port, which, of course, wasn't included in the coupon. As part of the deal, they took our picture and put it on a wine bottle label - they might want to invest in a new printer, as the photo and label are so washed out, you can barely make out our faces. To top it all off, we still had to pay a mandatory 15% gratuity (for what??) and tax, so even though we had already spent 40 on the Deal Chicken coupon, we still spent an additional 25 at Casavino.

The show was billed as the first spin-off of All in the Family, on which Beatrice Arthur had made two appearances in the character of Maude, Edith Bunker's cousin. Like All in the Family, Maude was a sitcom with topical storylines created by producer Norman Lear. Can we conclude that was maude a spin off of all in the family?","completion":"Yes, it can be concluded that Maude was indeed a spin-off from the television show All in the Family. This conclusion can be drawn based on the details provided. First, let's understand the terms. A spin-off in the context of television is a program featuring a character or characters that originally appeared in a different series. There are two primary ways a spin-off can be made: one is when a character from the original show leaves and appears in a completely different setting and usually in their own new storyline. The second is when a group of characters in the show are taken and a new show is created, focusing on this group. Let's refer back to the information on Maude. The show was billed as the first spin-off of All in the Family - this statement explicitly suggests that Maude is a product of All in the Family and hence qualifies it as a spin-off. Beatrice Arthur who played the character Maude, is stated to have made two appearances on All in the Family before the inception of Maude. She is described as Edith Bunker's cousin, which signifies her role's linkage to the original series. This character continuity is typical of many spin-offs and supports the assertion that Maude was a spin-off. Additionally, it’s notable that both shows were created by Norman Lear, further solidifying the connection between them. Often, spin-offs are initiated by the same creative team that helmed the original series, lending thematic and stylistic coherence between the two productions. Furthermore, noting that Maude, like All in the Family, was a sitcom with topical storylines suggests a narrative continuation of the style and structure applied in All in the Family. So, considering all these points, the assertion that Maude is a spin-off of All in the Family is supported by substantial evidence based on the historical context, character continuity, creator commonality, and similarity in genre and thematic elements."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who conducted the Munich Philharmonic in Munich on September 12, 1910? ? The Symphony No. 8 in E-flat major by Gustav Mahler is one of the largest-scale choral works in the classical concert repertoire. Because it requires huge instrumental and vocal forces it is frequently called the \\"Symphony of a Thousand\\", although the work is normally presented with far fewer than a thousand performers and the composer did not sanction that name. The work was composed in a single inspired burst, at Maiernigg in southern Austria in the summer of 1906. The last of Mahler's works that was premiered in his lifetime, the symphony was a critical and popular success when he conducted the Munich Philharmonic in its first performance, in Munich, on 12 September 1910. The fusion of song and symphony had been a characteristic of Mahler's early works. In his \\"middle\\" compositional period after 1901, a change of direction led him to produce three purely instrumental symphonies. The Eighth, marking the end of the middle period, returns to a combination of orchestra and voice in a symphonic context. The structure of the work is unconventional; instead of the normal framework of several movements, the piece is in two parts. Part I is based on the Latin text of a 9th-century Christian hymn for Pentecost, Veni creator spiritus (\\"Come, Creator Spirit\\"), and Part II is a setting of the words from the closing scene of Goethe's Faust. The two parts are unified by a common idea, that of redemption through the power of love, a unity conveyed through shared musical themes. Mahler had been convinced from the start of the work's significance; in renouncing the pessimism that had marked much of his music, he offered the Eighth as an expression of confidence in the eternal human spirit. In the period following the composer's death, performances were comparatively rare. However, from the mid-20th century onwards the symphony has been heard regularly in concert halls all over the world, and has been recorded many times. While recognising its wide popularity, modern critics have divided opinions on the work; Theodor W....","completion":"The last name of the person who conducted the Munich Philharmonic in Munich on September 12, 1910 is Mahler."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: What is the answer for the question: What is the full real name of the person that has hair loss? from the following article ? 11-year-old Annie Parker is living the perfect young life, loved by all, and especially by her mother, father, and older sister. But none of them knows that something horrible is stalking their perfect family. On a fall afternoon in 1976, young Annie hears a noise from upstairs. Her mother has collapsed and died, and an agonizing downward spiral begins. At UC Berkeley a brilliant research geneticist named Mary-Claire King is embarking on something of a personal crusade to uncover the genetic roots of breast cancer. While still in her twenties, she has already made a famous discovery that made the cover of Science—quantifying the genetic variation between humans and chimpanzees. But her conviction that there is a hereditary basis to at least some forms of breast cancer is not widely shared. Nevertheless, her tireless research throughout the 1980s would end in a medical breakthrough—the discovery of the location of the BRCA1 hereditary breast cancer gene—considered one of the most important scientific discoveries of the twentieth century.At the age of 19, after the sudden death of her father, Anne marries Paul and soon is pregnant. She struggles to find a way in the world with her equally young but misguided husband and her older sister, Joan Parker who tries to become a surrogate parent to Anne. But, cruelly, Joan contracts the same cancer that killed their mother, and in a few months, she, too, is dead. Annie is diagnosed with the same disease that killed her mother and sister—breast cancer. It is severe, and surgery and chemotherapy, with all its accompanying difficulties, soon follows. She loses her hair, and if that wasn't enough to endure, her husband, never really mature or stable, has begun an affair with Anne's closest friend Louise, and leaves her. Paul is soon diagnosed with cancer and expires shortly before she is diagnosed with a second cancer.

They both study horticulture. They've been studying ants lately for their entomology class. Hannah studied ants that farm aphids, while Joe studied ants that farm fungus. But I can use this background: Some species of ants farm aphids, protecting them on the plants where they are feeding, and consuming the honeydew the aphids release from the terminations of their alimentary canals. This is a mutualistic relationship, with these dairying ants milking the aphids by stroking them with their antennae. Although mutualistic, the feeding behaviour of aphids is altered by ant attendance. Aphids attended by ants tend to increase the production of honeydew in smaller drops with a greater concentration of amino acids.Some farming ant species gather and store the aphid eggs in their nests over the winter. In the spring, the ants carry the newly hatched aphids back to the plants. Some species of dairying ants (such as the European yellow meadow ant, Lasius flavus) manage large herds of aphids that feed on roots of plants in the ant colony. Queens leaving to start a new colony take an aphid egg to found a new herd of underground aphids in the new colony. These farming ants protect the aphids by fighting off aphid predators.

The genus is characterized by its dark chasmothecia which bear filamentous , hyaline appendages with hooked tips . Over one hundred species have been described from mostly dicotyledenous hosts . Braun and Takamatsu ( 2000 ) suggested that Uncinula should be considered a later synonym of Erysiphe ; not all subsequent researchers have accepted their conclusions . One notorious species , Uncinula necator ( syn . Erysiphe necator ) , attacks various species of grapes ( Vitis spp . ) and can cause yield losses in European wine grapes . Other Uncinula species attack a wide variety of dicotyledonous plants . - Powdery mildew is a fungal disease that affects a wide range of plants. Powdery mildew diseases are caused by many different species of fungi in the order Erysiphales, with \\"Podosphaera xanthii\\" (a.k.a. \\"Sphaerotheca fuliginea\\") being the most commonly reported cause. \\"Erysiphe cichoracearum\\" was formerly reported to be the primary causal organism throughout most of the world. Powdery mildew is one of the easier plant diseases to identify, as its symptoms are quite distinctive. Infected plants display white powdery spots on the leaves and stems. The lower leaves are the most affected, but the mildew can appear on any above-ground part of the plant. As the disease progresses, the spots get larger and denser as large numbers of asexual spores are formed, and the mildew may spread up and down the length of the plant. - Erysiphe is a genus of fungi in the Erysiphaceae family. Many of the species in this genus are plant pathogens which cause powdery mildew. - Erysiphe cichoracearum is a plant pathogen that causes powdery mildew disease of cucurbits, including melon, cucumber, pumpkin, and squash. The primary symptoms are white, powder-like spots on the leaves and stems. \\"Sphaerotheca fuliginea\\" causes a similar looking powdery mildew of cucurbits. - Mildew is a form of fungus. It is distinguished from its closely related counterpart, mold (British English: mould), largely by its color: molds appear in shades of black, blue, red, and green, whereas mildew is white.

Summarize: Officers have used dogs to search the sites and \\"ground penetrating radar\\" to look for disturbed earth. The searches follow a request from the Metropolitan Police, who launched a fresh investigation into Madeleine's disappearance last July. Madeleine, of Rothley, Leicestershire, was three when she went missing from her family's holiday apartment on 3 May 2007. See the details below to find out about what happened that day and for the location of the latest police searches. 15:30-17:30 Charity men seen 20:30 McCanns go for dinner 21:05 McCanns check on children 21:15 Jane Tanner sees man and child 22:00 Irish family sees man and child 22:00 McCanns raise alarm Scotland Yard says detectives are looking into possible links to burglaries and bogus charity collections in the area at the time. They have released two e-fit images of Portuguese men they would like to identify. There were four separate sightings of charity collectors on the afternoon of 3 May in Praia da Luz. One man approached a property on Rua do Ramalhete, near the Ocean Club, at about 16:00. Another collector called at another apartment on 25 or 26 April. Police say there was also a four-fold increase in the number of burglaries in the area between January and May 2007 and one possible scenario was that Madeleine had disturbed a burglar. The McCanns were on holiday with a group of friends who met for dinner each evening at a Tapas bar on the Ocean Club complex where they were staying. On the day Madeleine went missing, Mr and Mrs McCann left their apartment at 20:30 and headed to the restaurant. Throughout the evening, adults from the group would leave at regular intervals to check on their children. A member of the group - Matthew Oldfield - left at 21:00, shortly followed by Gerry McCann. Mr McCann left the retaurant to check on his children at about 21:05. When he reached the apartment, he noticed the bedroom door was open wider than it had been left. On his return to the restaurant, he stopped to chat to a guest. Matthew Oldfield also checked on the McCanns' apartment at about 21:30. Hearing no noise from the children's bedroom, he assumed all was well and left without seeing Madeleine. Having left the table to check on her own children, another member of the group, Jane Tanner, saw a man carrying a child close to the McCanns' apartment. This sighting, which had previously been the focus of the investigation, has now been discounted by police. Detectives said the man was almost certainly an innocent British holiday-maker collecting his two-year-old daughter from a nearby creche. An Irish family returning from a night out saw a man carrying a blonde-haired child, aged about three or four, possibly wearing pyjamas. He was walking down a street towards the beach at about 22:00. The beach is a few minutes' walk from the McCanns' apartment. Two of the witnesses have helped produce an e-fit of the man they saw. They described him as white, aged in his 30s, of medium build and medium height, with short brown hair. After friend Matthew Oldfield had checked on the McCanns' children half an hour previously, Kate McCann returned to the apartment at 22:00. It was then that she noticed the children's bedroom window was open, the shutter raised and Madeleine gone. The first search area was cordoned off by police at the beginning of June, but nothing of interest was found. It is situated south-west of the Ocean Club complex, where the McCann family were staying in 2007. The scrubland, about the size of three football pitches, is surrounded by flats and villas and overlooks the sea. The second area is on the other side of the Praia da Luz, close to the main road leading out of town. A third location was also investigated across the road from the second search area. On 11 June, police said their searches had not yielded any results. Summary:","completion":"Madeleine McCann, a three-year-old from Rothley, went missing from her family's holiday apartment in Praia da Luz on May 3, 2007. The family and friends were dining nearby and periodically checking on the children. The timeline includes various sightings of men carrying children around the time Madeleine disappeared. Police are investigating possible connections to burglaries and bogus charity collections in the area and have released e-fit images of two Portuguese men.

After reading the above, is \\"Bheema\\" the correct answer to the question \\"Who makes dice from his father's spinal cord, and do they roll the right number?\\"?","completion":"No, \\"Bheema\\" is not the correct answer to the question \\"Who makes dice from his father's spinal cord, and do they roll the right number?\\" According to the given text, it is Sakuni who makes the dice from his father's spinal cord. Sakuni is a prince from the kingdom of Gandhara. After his kingdom is attacked by Duryodhana and his family is starved in Duryodhana's prison, Sakuni is chosen by the king of Gandhara to survive. The king of Gandhara believed that by keeping Sakuni alive, there would be a chance for survival. Following this, Sakuni swears revenge on the Kauravas for their actions against his family and kingdom. In order to fulfill his oath and destroy the Kauravas, Sakuni crafts magic dice from his deceased father's spinal cord. These dice are magical in nature and will show exactly the number he wants, effectively rigging any game of dice in which they are used. Sakuni's inclusion in the Kaurava's evil coterie - a group that includes Duryodhana, Karna, and Dushyasana - further demonstrates his commitment to the destruction of the Kauravas. He takes advantage of their trust and pity, using his magic dice as the tool to accumulate power and destabilize the Kauravas' rule. Therefore, Sakuni is the correct response to the question."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Aircraft carrier: Since World War II, aircraft carrier designs have increased in size to accommodate a steady increase in aircraft size. The large, modern Nimitz class of US carriers has a displacement nearly four times that of the World War II–era USS Enterprise, yet its complement of aircraft is roughly the same—a consequence of the steadily increasing size and weight of military aircraft over the years. Today's aircraft carriers are so expensive that nations which operate them risk significant political, economic, and military impact if a carrier is lost, or even used in conflict. Please answer a question about this article. If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\". Why do nations risk minimal political impacts if a carrier is lost or even used in conflict?","completion":"The question seems to misinterpret the information provided in the article. The article states that nations risk significant political, economic, and military impacts if a carrier is lost or even used in conflict, not minimal political impacts. The reason for these significant impacts is due to the high cost and strategic value of aircraft carriers, making their loss or involvement in conflict a major concern for the nation operating them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Multi-choice problem: Based on the sentence \\"A man doing a skate trick on a metal railing.\\", is the sentence \\"A man on skates.\\" a true sentence? Options are: * yes * it is not possible to tell * no","completion":"Yes, the sentence \\"A man on skates\\" can be considered a true sentence based on the information provided in the original sentence, \\"A man doing a skate trick on a metal railing.\\" Here is a detailed explanation of the reasoning behind this conclusion: First, let's break down the elements present in the original sentence. 1. There is a man mentioned in the sentence, which is the primary subject. 2. He is performing an activity, which is doing a skate trick. 3. The location of that activity is specified, which is on a metal railing. Now, let's analyze the second sentence, \\"A man on skates.\\" We need to determine if this sentence is a true representation of the information present in the original sentence. 1. The second sentence also mentions a man, which is consistent with the original sentence. 2. The activity or state of the man is not explicitly mentioned in the second sentence, but the fact that he is \\"on skates\\" implies the involvement of skates in his activity. 3. The location is not mentioned in the second sentence, so it doesn't conflict with the information provided in the first sentence. When comparing the two sentences, we can infer that the man in the original sentence is using some form of skates, such as a skateboard, inline skates, or roller skates, to perform a trick on a metal railing. From this, it stands to reason that the man is indeed \\"on skates.\\" As a result, the sentence \\"A man on skates\\" does not contradict the information provided in the original sentence and can be considered a true sentence based on the available information."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Choose your answer from: [+] her personal attitudes may affect her students if she is prejudiced; [+] she need to improve herself too; [+] she is also often influenced by her students; [+] she may not have a constant attitude towards some controversial sues; Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Of all the areas of learning the most important is the development of attitudes. Emotional reactions as well as logical thought processes affect the behavior of most people. \\"The burnt child fears the fire\\" is one instance; another is the rise of figures like Hitler. Both these examples point up the fact that attitudes come from experience. In the one case the experience was direct and impressive; in the other it was indirect and gradual. The classroom teacher in the elementary school is in strategic position to influence attitudes. This is true partly because children acquire attitudes from those adults whose word they respect. Another reason it is true is that pupils often search somewhat deeply into a subject in school that has only been touched upon at home or has possibly never occurred to them before. To a child who has previously acquire little knowledge of Mexico, his teacher's method of handling such a unit would greatly affect his attitude toward Mexicans. The teacher can develop proper attitudes through social studies, science matters, the very atmosphere of the classroom, etc. However, when children come to school with undesirable attitudes, it is unwise to attempt to change their feelings by criticizing them. The teacher can achieve the proper effect by helping them obtain constructive experience. To illustrate, first-grade pupils, afraid of policemen will probably change their attitudes after a classroom talk with the neighborhood officer in which he explains how he protects them. In the same way, a class of older children can develop attitudes through discussion, research, outside reading and all-day trips. Finally, a teacher must constantly evaluate her own attitudes, because her influence can be harmful she has personal prejudices. This is especially true in respect to controversial issues and questions of which children should be encouraged to reach their own decisions as result of objective analysis of all the facts. Question: In the author's opinion, a teacher must constantly evaluate her own attitudes because _ . Answer: A:","completion":"In the author's opinion, a teacher must constantly evaluate her own attitudes because her personal attitudes may affect her students if she is prejudiced. This is especially true in respect to controversial issues and questions, as children should be encouraged to reach their own decisions as a result of objective analysis of all the facts. A teacher's personal attitudes can have a significant impact on how students perceive and respond to different topics and situations. If a teacher holds prejudiced beliefs or takes a biased stance on certain subjects, that bias is likely to be passed on to the students, shaping their attitudes as well. It is crucial for a teacher to always be self-aware and ensure that they are promoting an open-minded and inclusive learning environment, where students can form their own opinions and develop proper attitudes informed by a fair assessment of all available information. Furthermore, the teacher should also strive to improve themselves and be aware of the influence their students may have on them, as it is crucial for their growth and adaptability in catering to a diverse classroom environment.

[iv] Use a sponge to remove any debris from inside the irrigation system. Use water from a hose to remove any remaining water that may have spilled over the entrance and exit..","completion":"Option [ii] appears to be the most appropriate next step in repairing a leaking irrigation system. Here is the detailed explanation of the process from the beginning: 1. Begin by using a bucket and a scoop, or dig trenches, to drain away any excess water and mud from the leaking area of the irrigation system. 2. Wipe the area clean with rags, ensuring that it is as free of water, dirt, and mud as possible during the repair. This will help you to locate the source of the leak and properly assess the damage. 3. Utilize a mitre box or pipe cutter to cut away the affected pipe and/or fittings, making sure that the cuts are square with the pipe. This step is crucial for making a clean and precise cut, which will enable you to make a strong and leak-free connection when replacing the damaged section of the pipe. 4. File away any rough edges on the end of the pipe where it was cut. This will ensure a smooth surface for attaching the new pipe or fitting, helping to prevent future leaks. 5. Proceed by measuring and cutting the necessary replacement pipe or fitting. Be sure to measure the length of the cut pipe precisely, in order to fit it appropriately into place with the existing irrigation system. 6. Before installing the new pipe or fitting, clean the exposed ends of the existing pipes and the replacement piece, removing any debris, dust, or dirt that may have accumulated. This will help to create a secure connection and prevent future leaks. 7. Apply a PVC primer and appropriate adhesive to the ends of the pipe and the new fitting. Then, attach the replacement piece securely to the existing irrigation system, ensuring that it is properly aligned and connected. 8. Allow adequate time for the adhesive to dry and create a strong bond between the pipes. This will ensure that the repair is durable and resistant to leaks. 9. Once the adhesive has fully dried and set, turn on the irrigation system to test for any leaks and ensure that the repair was successful. If necessary, make any additional adjustments to the repair area. 10. Finally, refill the trenches with soil and compact it to prevent any future damage or shifting of the pipes. If needed, reposition the irrigation system components, such as sprinkler heads, to ensure optimal coverage and functionality. Following these steps should help to repair a leaking irrigation system effectively, ensuring that water is distributed efficiently and consistently throughout your desired area."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Born at Podolskaya Street in Saint Petersburg, Russia, Shostakovich was the second of three children of Dmitri Boleslavovich Shostakovich and Sofiya Vasilievna Kokoulina. Shostakovich's paternal grandfather, originally surnamed Szostakowicz, was of Polish Roman Catholic descent (his family roots trace to the region of the town of Vileyka in today's Belarus), but his immediate forebears came from Siberia. A Polish revolutionary in the January Uprising of 1863–4, Bolesław Szostakowicz would be exiled to Narym (near Tomsk) in 1866 in the crackdown that followed Dmitri Karakozov's assassination attempt on Tsar Alexander II. When his term of exile ended, Szostakowicz decided to remain in Siberia. He eventually became a successful banker in Irkutsk and raised a large family. His son Dmitri Boleslavovich Shostakovich, the composer's father, was born in exile in Narim in 1875 and studied physics and mathematics in Saint Petersburg University, graduating in 1899. He then went to work as an engineer under Dmitri Mendeleev at the Bureau of Weights and Measures in Saint Petersburg. In 1903 he married another Siberian transplant to the capital, Sofiya Vasilievna Kokoulina, one of six children born to a Russian Siberian native.Their son, Dmitri Dmitriyevich Shostakovich, displayed significant musical talent after he began piano lessons with his mother at the age of nine.

Can you fix that?","completion":"The boat paints are just as usable as water under water. Certainly! Here's the corrected version with proper capitalization: The boat paints are just as usable as water underwater. To provide a more detailed explanation on this topic, let's discuss how boat paints have been specifically designed for underwater usage. Boat paints, also known as marine or antifouling paints, are specifically formulated to protect vessels from the harsh underwater environment. These paints need to withstand not only the constant pressure and motion of water but also the various microorganisms, algae, and other marine life that can attach themselves to the boat's hull. There are several factors that contribute to the effectiveness of boat paints in underwater conditions: 1. Waterproof: Boat paints contain specialized resins and additives that create a highly waterproof barrier, preventing water infiltration and protecting the boat's surface from moisture damage. This is essential, given that the boat paint is always submerged in water. 2. Antifouling properties: One of the primary goals of boat paint is to prevent the growth of marine life on the boat's hull. Marine organisms can cause significant drag and negatively impact fuel efficiency and speed. Boat paints contain biocides like copper or other chemical compounds that deter marine organisms from attaching to the boat's surface. 3. Durability: Since vessels are exposed to harsh conditions both above and below water, boat paints must be durable, able to withstand constant impact from waves, UV exposure, and corrosive saltwater. Marine paints are formulated to provide long-lasting protection and maintain their integrity in these conditions. 4. Adhesion: A boat paint's ability to adhere to various substrates (fiberglass, wood, metal) and withstand the stress of flexing, twisting, and impacts is crucial for its underwater performance. High-quality marine paints contain strong adhesion properties that enable them to remain bonded to the boat's surface even in turbulent waters. 5. Compatibility: Marine paints need to be compatible with various boat materials, ensuring that they do not damage or cause issues with other components of the boat. For example, boat paints should not cause any adverse reactions with metals, plastics, or other materials used in the boat's construction. Overall, boat paints are made specifically for underwater usage, offering protection, durability, and performance in harsh marine conditions. Through their unique formulations and properties, marine paints provide exceptional underwater protection, ensuring that the vessel remains functional even when submerged in water."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Will Dwight finish his growth spurt before or after Jimothy? Hint: Another obvious change that occurs during puberty is rapid growth. This is called the adolescent growth spurt. In boys, it is controlled by testosterone. The rate of growth usually starts to increase relatively early in puberty. At its peak rate, growth in height is about 10 centimeters (almost 4 inches) per year in the average male. Growth generally remains rapid for several years. Growth and development of muscles occur toward the end of the growth spurt in height.

Eurydice (Marpessa Dawn) arrives in Rio de Janeiro, and takes a trolley driven by Orfeu (Breno Mello). New to the city, she rides to the end of the line, where Orfeu introduces her to the station guard, Hermes (Alexandro Constantino), who gives her directions to the home of her cousin Serafina (LÃ©a Garcia). Although engaged to Mira (Lourdes de Oliveira), Orfeu is not very enthusiastic about the upcoming marriage. The couple go to get a marriage license. When the clerk at the courthouse hears Orfeu's name, he jokingly asks if Mira is Eurydice, annoying her. Afterward, Mira insists on getting an engagement ring. Though Orfeu has just been paid, he would rather use his money to get his guitar out of the pawn shop for the carnival. Mira finally offers to loan Orfeu the money to buy her ring. When Orfeu goes home, he is pleased to find Eurydice staying next door with Serafina. Eurydice has run away to Rio to hide from a strange man who she believes wants to kill her. The man â Death dressed in a stylized skeleton costume â finds her, but Orfeu gallantly chases him away. Orfeu and Eurydice fall in love, yet are constantly on the run from both Mira and Death. When Serafina's sailor boyfriend Chico (Waldemar De Souza) shows up, Orfeu offers to let Eurydice sleep in his home, while he takes the hammock outside. Eurydice invites him to her bed. Orfeu, Mira, and Serafina are the principal members of a samba school, one of many parading during Carnival. Serafina decides to have Eurydice dress in her costume so that she can spend more time with her sailor. A veil conceals Eurydice's face; only Orfeu is told of the deception. During the parade, Orfeu dances with Eurydice rather than Mira. Eventually, Mira spots Serafina among the spectators and rips off Eurydiceâs veil.

Title: Planet of the Apes Movie plot: Astronauts Taylor (Charlton Heston), Landon (Robert Gunner), Dodge (Jeff Burton) and Stewart are in deep hibernation when their spaceship crashes in a lake on an unknown planet after a long near-light speed voyage, during which, due to time dilation, the crew ages only 18 months. As the ship sinks, Taylor finds Stewart dead and her body desiccated. They throw an inflatable raft from the ship and climb down into it; before departing the ship, Taylor notes that the date is November 25, 3978, approximately two millennia after their departure in 1972. Once ashore, Dodge performs a soil test and pronounces the soil incapable of sustaining life. After abandoning their raft, the astronauts set off through a desolate wasteland in hopes of finding food and water before their provisions run out. Eventually, they encounter plant life. They find an oasis at the edge of the desert and go swimming, ignoring eerie scarecrow-like figures around the edge of the water. While they are swimming, their clothes are stolen. Pursuing the thieves, the astronauts find their clothes torn to shreds, their supplies pillaged and the perpetrators â a group of humans that are apparently so primitive that they cannot even talk and dressed in torn clothes â raiding a cornfield. Taylor is attracted to one of the humans, whom he later names Nova (Linda Harrison). Suddenly, armed and uniformed gorillas on horseback charge through the cornfield, brandishing firearms, snares, and nets. They capture some humans and kill the rest. In the chaos, Dodge is shot in the back and killed, Landon is wounded and rendered unconscious, and Taylor is shot in the throat and taken prisoner. The gorillas take Taylor to Ape City, where his life is saved after a blood transfusion administered by two chimpanzees, an animal psychologist Zira (Kim Hunter) and surgeon Galen (Wright King).

Given the question: As someone diagnosed with bpd this question kinda tugged at my heart, for a few reasons. From my understanding, the core of the disorder is an unstable sense of self and an inherent shame or worthlessness. Before I was treated I thought I just needed someone else, the right person to come along to love me in just the right way, being mindful of trauma and never triggering my symptoms. I was living in a fantasy world. You cannot expect another person, a whole person with a sound mind and stable to sense of self to subject themselves to the circus act of our lives. We can't even manage it ourselves!! I have been in two long-term relationships, and dozens of short ones six months or less. One of the two began when I was very low and lasted a very toxic 3 years. I entered treatment during that relationship, which resulted in it's demise. I was much happier afterward. The second relationship began after I completed treatment. We have seperated twice during the past 2 and a half years, and our relationship is currently rocky as well. But who I am in the relationship has changed. I am no longer the girl who needs extra reassurance daily that he's coming home from work. I can breathe when he goes to hang out with his friends. I am not threatened by every waking thought of his not being about me. Instead I am the woman that validates him and myself in arguments, and I put respect over everything. Of course I lose my temper. Self improvement is a constant process. But, to avoid hurting anyone you love, you should definitely talk to a counselor if you are looking for another person to help you :) For family members/lovers/caregivers, it's stressful and often results in a lot of resentment in the relationship!

On 20 July 1976, childhood friends Bernard Sumner and Peter Hook separately attended a Sex Pistols show at the Manchester Lesser Free Trade Hall. Both were inspired by the Pistols' performance. Sumner said that he felt the Pistols \\"destroyed the myth of being a pop star, of a musician being some kind of god that you had to worship\\". The following day Hook borrowed £35 from his mother to buy a bass guitar. They formed a band with Terry Mason, who had also attended the gig; Sumner bought a guitar, and Mason a drum kit. After their schoolfriend Martin Gresty declined an invitation to join as vocalist after getting a job at a factory, the band placed an advertisement for a vocalist in the Manchester Virgin Records shop. Ian Curtis, who knew them from earlier gigs, responded and was hired without audition. Sumner said that he \\"knew he was all right to get on with and that's what we based the whole group on. If we liked someone, they were in.\\"Buzzcocks manager Richard Boon and frontman Pete Shelley have both been credited with suggesting the band name \\"Stiff Kittens\\", but the band settled on \\"Warsaw\\" shortly before their first gig, a reference to David Bowie's song \\"Warszawa\\". Warsaw debuted on 29 May 1977 at the Electric Circus, supporting the Buzzcocks, Penetration and John Cooper Clarke. Tony Tabac played drums that night after joining the band two days earlier. Reviews in the NME by Paul Morley and in Sounds by Ian Wood brought them immediate national exposure. Mason became the band's manager and Tabac was replaced on drums in June 1977 by Steve Brotherdale, who also played in the punk band Panik. Brotherdale tried to get Curtis to leave the band and join Panik, and even had Curtis audition. In July 1977, Warsaw recorded five demo tracks at Pennine Sound Studios, Oldham.

Article: Humble hero uses Medal of Honor to raise awareness of the wounds of war WASHINGTON — Ty Carter sat on the back of his camper, parked near a gas station in the remote Oregon woods, with his two dogs asleep and his kids arguing and his wife feeding the baby, waiting for a phone call he didn’t really want to take. A colonel from the Pentagon had contacted him a week earlier, to ask whether he would be available that day for a call from a “high-ranking military official.” Carter said no. It would be in the middle of his family vacation — he had promised them a trip to Crater Lake. “He sounded kind of exasperated, so I could tell that was the wrong answer,” Carter said, laughing. He agreed to take a detour, to stay within cell-phone range a few hours longer. When the call came, it was the commander-in-chief, who congratulated Carter on being chosen for the Medal of Honor. Sitting on the back bumper as the occasional car sped by, the soldier thanked him, traded stories about raising children, then got back in the car to continue the drive south. That’s how Army Staff Sgt. Ty Carter learned he’d be recognized as one of America’s greatest heroes. Not from a lavish White House ceremony, which comes Monday. Not from a summons to the Pentagon, or even to his base commander’s office. From a cell-phone call at a remote gas station — actually, across the street from the gas station because folks there were worried about him loitering so he had to move the camper. Monday, Carter will become the fifth living Medal of Honor recipient for actions in Afghanistan. Only 12 men from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars have been honored with the award, singled out for “conspicuous gallantry” and “selfless courage” on the battlefield. The common thread between the survivors’ stories has been their humility, even compared to the proud-without-boasting heroes of the past. All of them said they were just doing their job, that any other servicemember would have done the same, that they aren’t inherently different than any other American who joined the military. “I am an American soldier, just like thousands who have served, will serve and are continuing to serve this great nation,” he said at a news conference at his home base of Joint Base Lewis-McChord just days after the White House announcement. “This award is not mine alone.” Carter, 33, has spent most of the last few weeks starkly recounting battlefield chaos to reporters while privately trying to explain what the battlefield was like to his 14-year-old son, Jayden. Madison, 8, was more interested in buying a new dress for the trip to Washington. With the Medal of Honor effectively making him undeployable — recipients have said Pentagon leaders are reluctant to send them back into harm’s way — he wants to continue his service in wounded warrior units, sharing his struggles with post-traumatic stress. He’s uncomfortable facing the families of the men who died fighting alongside him, freely admitting to a mix of guilt and post-traumatic stress whenever he speaks to them. “We all did what we could to keep each other alive,” he said. The battlefield Carter is the second Medal of Honor recipient from the Battle of Kamdesh, one of the few fights in Afghanistan to catch the attention of the American public. Clint Romesha received his award earlier this year, for fighting done on the other side of the remote Army firebase. On Oct. 3, 2009, more than 300 Taliban fighters descended on Combat Outpost Keating, a soon-to-be-abandoned site near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, in a well-coordinated ambush. Eight U.S. soldiers would be killed in the daylong battle, and 22 wounded. When the fighting began — a hail of bullets from above, almost immediately overwhelming the 54-man force inside the COP — then-Spc. Carter was asleep. He rushed into battle wearing a tan T-shirt and PT shorts but did manage to grab his body armor. He spent most of the day out of uniform, just trying to survive. Carter and three others were pinned down around a sandbagged Humvee serving as a guard tower, dodging between cover as the enemy advanced. He watched two friends die in the early assault and two more die trying to support his position. Another, Spc. Stephan Mace, was gravely wounded by a rocket-propelled grenade and left stranded in the middle of the kill zone. Carter’s commanding sergeant forbade him from attempting rescue after the explosion, saying it was a suicide mission. Over the next agonizing hours, Carter watched Mace slowly dying just out of reach. “A good man was lying there wounded, begging for my help,” he said, swallowing hard as he fought back tears. “But [Sgt. Brad] Larson knew that if I went out there, I’d be dead too. For that, I owe him my life.” So the two men kept fighting. When they ran out of ammo, Carter scavenged magazines from a nearby bombed Humvee. When he and Larson saw Taliban fighters walking onto the COP, they worried the base was beyond saving. Between bursts of gunfire, Carter said they discussed crawling down the nearby hillside, rolling into the river and floating down to the next Army base a few miles downstream. It was a bad escape plan, but possibly the only option. Still, Carter was focused on Mace. As the firefight began to shift in their favor — thanks to the efforts of Romesha across the base and aerial support — Carter pressed Larson again to let him try to rescue Mace. Larson relented. Carter ran onto exposed ground to pull the almost lifeless Mace to safety. He had to make two trips — out to stabilize the fallen soldier, back to coordinate cover fire with Larson, out again to drag Mace across the kill zone back to relative safety. On his next scavenging mission, Carter found a fallen comrade’s radio and managed to connect with the men across the COP. They set up an evacuation plan, got themselves out of the Humvee prison and took Mace to the medics. “I had told myself long before that if I ended up in that kind of situation, I wouldn’t let fear make my choices for me,” Carter said. “All I thought about was supporting [our] men.” Getting back to his squad wasn’t the end of the day for Carter. He spent the next few hours working as half of a sniper team, picking off enemies along the hillside. Later, when a tree caught on fire outside the medical station, Carter went out with full battle rattle and a chainsaw to keep the flames from spreading. “It actually fell on the TOC (tactical operating station) and put out the fire on its roof, so that was good,” he said, smiling at the memory of his battlefield lumberjacking. By then, the battle was mostly over. Mace and other wounded were evacuated. It wasn’t until a few hours later, while the remaining men were still recovering the bodies of their fallen friends, that they learned Mace died in surgery. “I didn’t feel angry that we lost them,” Carter said. “I just felt the loss. I just felt sad. “I don’t want to put down the Medal of Honor or what it means. But when you’ve lost family ...” Carter still describes his actions largely as a failure, especially when reflecting on Mace’s death. Mace’s mother, Vanessa Adelson, disagrees. “My son didn’t die in the dirt alone, because of what Ty did,” she told reporters last week. “After seeing another soldier get killed trying to rescue my son, Ty still went out there to save him. “Because of what he did, Stephan had a few more hours with his brothers. He was able to speak with them (before he was evacuated). He was joking about getting a beer with the surgeons afterwards. “Because of Ty’s actions, my son died thinking that he was coming home. He was at peace.” The aftermath Carter didn’t attend Romesha’s Medal of Honor ceremony, saying the 4-year-old battle still felt too raw for him. He talks about the nine losses his troop suffered in that battle — fellow soldier Ed Faulker Jr. battled PTSD and took his own life a year after the attack. He has been open about his own struggles with PTSD, and said he hopes to use the new honor as a forum to talk about the stress of war and the stigma of seeking mental help. He deployed again to Afghanistan last year and has been in counseling to help him handle the battlefield horrors he can never unsee. “America’s citizen soldiers are doing amazing things to make them proud,” he said. “But people need to be more aware of the wounds of combat, both the visual wounds and the unseen ones.” That’s the man he wants people to see receiving the nation’s highest military honor: a U.S. soldier who did his job and is struggling with the aftermath. He’s talked to fellow medal recipient Sgt. 1st Class Leroy Petry — who lost his hand hurling an enemy grenade away from wounded soldiers in Afghanistan — about how to direct the story away from himself and toward the larger sacrifices of servicemembers. He’s more comfortable talking about his struggles than his successes. Army officials insist that Carter is more than just another soldier: His “remarkable acts of heroism and skill … exemplify what it means to be an American hero.” His family sees the hero and the humble man. His wife, Shannon, told reporters earlier this month that recaps of his battlefield heroism are too overwhelming to process, but “he’s my husband … he blows my mind every day.” She’ll accompany him into the East Room of the White House for today’s formal ceremony, likely trying to keep 8-month old daughter Sehara quiet while the commander-in-chief speaks. His parents will be there too, along soldiers from his Army unit and from past medal-worthy battles. In an interview with Army media, Carter’s father, Mark, wept while talking about what it will mean to see his son honored by the president. “Not too many dads get to experience this,” he said, “where their son or daughter survives and then gets recognized nationally for an act of being himself in a dire situation.” shane.leo@stripes.com Twitter: @LeoShane ||||| For more, watch \\"Jake Tapper Reports: An Unlikely Hero\\" tonight August 21 at 10 p.m. ET/PT. Jake Tapper, host of \\"The Lead\\" and CNN's chief Washington correspondent, is the author of the best-selling book, \\"The Outpost: An Untold Story of American Valor.\\" (CNN) -- When Spc.Ty Carter first arrived in Afghanistan, he took one look at his surroundings and thought, \\"This is a death trap.\\" He would soon learn just how right he was. Combat Outpost Keating was a sitting target for nearby Taliban insurgents: It sat deep within a valley, surrounded by mountains. The American soldiers stationed there knew it was only a matter of time before something bad happened. \\"We just didn't know when,\\" Carter said. When it did, the assault would set in motion a chaotic chain of events that had every soldier certain he would not make it out alive. Eight American soldiers died on October 3, 2009. Many of the 45 others who survived, including Carter, struggle with the guilt that they couldn't save more lives. Yet Carter's daring efforts to rescue his fellow soldiers in the face of imminent death earned him the nation's highest military decoration, the Medal of Honor, which he will receive on Monday at a White House ceremony. Now Staff Sgt. Ty Carter, 33, will join another survivor of that battle, former Army Staff Sgt. Clint Romesha, who received the award earlier this year. It marks the first time in nearly half a century that two living soldiers from the same battle received the Medal of Honor. To Carter, it's a bittersweet award. \\"It just brings back all those memories of what he had to go through,\\" explained his wife, Shannon Derby. Discharged from the Marines Carter was a loner as a teenager. He didn't have a lot of friends. His older brother Seth had a knack for getting into trouble, and Ty followed in his footsteps for awhile before his mother kicked Seth out of the house. Not exactly hero material, he says. Carter joined the Marines in 1998, spending five years in the service until a fight with a roommate led to his demotion. Two months later, he was honorably discharged. So, it was back to civilian life, something that left Carter restless and bored. He bounced across the country from job to job: more than a dozen stints in five years, everything from a yacht repairman to a tow-truck operator. He was supporting his daughter after his first marriage ended. But in every job, something was always missing. \\"There was no motivation, there was no purpose,\\" Carter said. \\"It felt like I was a drone.\\" He hated the punch-in-punch-out lifestyle of making ends meet, and fondly recalled military life. \\"I was thinking 'Well man, back in the service ... I was doing what I enjoyed and I was actually happy to wake up in the morning, happy to go to work,'\\" he said. So he enlisted in the Army in 2008. But military life wasn't the idyllic place he remembered. \\"We had a platoon full of guys that were on a lighter side of life (who) liked to joke around,\\" retired Sgt. 1st Class Jonathan Hill recalled. \\"And Carter never really got involved ... he thought it was immature. \\"Carter really didn't make friends with a lot of guys, and he struggled with it.\\" A little over a year after he enlisted, Carter and his platoon were deployed to eastern Afghanistan in May 2009. Despite his aloofness toward his fellow soldiers, Carter would find himself in a situation where he didn't think twice to risk his life for those men whose jokes he once found childish. Defining moment Combat Outpost Keating had been built in Nuristan province in 2006 as part of the effort by NATO-led forces to build partnerships with local Afghans, and try to stop insurgents from trickling over in nearby Pakistan. The camp had experienced ups and downs since that time and by 2008, the cavalry commanders in charge of the outpost thought it made sense to shut it down. Yet there were other factors at play. Afghanistan's President Hamid Karzai was in the middle of his re-election campaign in fall 2009, and abandoning Combat Outpost Keating might have been seen as a lack of American support. So, despite numerous warnings, Gen. Stanley McChrystal -- then commander of all U.S. troops in Afghanistan -- kept the outpost open. After Karzai's victory and the end of a military operation that freed some key assets, the military leadership approved a plan to abandon the outpost and the troops stationed there were to start packing up on October 4, 2009. That never happened. Instead, a day before their planned departure, an assault was unleashed on the outpost that culminated in what has now been described as one of the most intense battles of the entire war in Afghanistan. The first shots rang out just a few minutes before 6 a.m. The rumors that the soldiers had heard for months were coming true. Carter said he had often imagined that day. \\"I was like, 'Well, if it's my time to go, how am I going out?' \\" he said. The Taliban had studied how the Americans responded to previous attacks, and they knew the outpost relied heavily on its mortars. So they made the big guns their first target. \\"When the enemy weren't shooting at us, they were shooting at the weapons,\\" Carter said. \\"So they were disabling the weapons.\\" The insurgent fire killed Pfc. Kevin Thomson as he raced to his post. Sgt. Josh Kirk was killed while returning fire. \\"You could hear the rounds coming in from every direction,\\" said platoon Sgt. Jon Hill. Troops begin running much-needed ammunition to the men on guard duty. Sgt. Michael Scusa was gunned down 10 feet outside one of the outpost's doors. In the midst of the gunfire, Sgt. Christopher Griffin \\"immediately ran out the door without hesitation,\\" Hill said. \\"He didn't make it back\\" Ammunition was starting to run out, so Ty Carter and other members of his Black Knight troop volunteered to deliver more -- a hundred yards away across the heaviest of gunfire. Carter didn't think twice about the danger. All he knew was there were three fellow soldiers -- Sgt. Bradley Larson, Spc. Stephan Mace and Sgt. Justin Gallegos -- trapped in a Humvee and they needed more supplies to return fire. \\"Carter's kinda like .. for lack of a better word, a robot,\\" Hill said. \\"You tell him to do something, he's gonna do it and he's gonna do it to the best of his ability.\\" He would return through that deadly gauntlet three times to get supplies to the men. When the firefight was over, the death toll would include Mace, Gallegos, Sgt. Josh Hardt, and Staff Sgt. Vernon Martin. The names of all eight men who died on that day are engraved on a steel band that Carter wears on his wrist, not that he needs the reminder. Read more about the battle from Jake Tapper's \\"The Outpost\\" Farm life Today, Carter still struggles with the memories of the battle, seeking solace with his wife and three children on their farm in Washington state near Joint Base Lewis-McChord, where he is now stationed. In the dark, quiet moments, the constant ringing in his head brings back difficult thoughts. \\"That's when the memories start kicking in and you can't sleep because, you know, the whole, 'I shoulda done this, I coulda done that,' \\" he said. \\"And then you see the faces of the soldiers that died.\\" Carter said he believes that one more name should be added to the death toll of the battle of Kamesh: Ed Faulkner Jr., who struggled with drug abuse and mental problems after surviving the battle. He left the army with severe PTSD and died in September 2010 after a fatal overdose of methadone and Xanax. While there was no evidence of a suicide, Faulkner's friends -- including Carter -- believe his death was linked to the battle. \\"I honestly believe that, yes, he was the ninth victim of Combat Outpost Keating,\\" Carter said. \\"And I also believe that he won't be the last.\\" Carter also struggles with PTSD, and now has regular therapy. \\"I didn't believe it was real until I experienced it,\\" he said of PTSD. \\"I thought it was just an excuse to get out of duty ... but once it hit me, and I realized it, I was blown away. How could I be so ignorant?\\" Carter wants to be a voice to destigmatize these invisible wounds of war, and he hopes that the attention he receives with the Medal of Honor will show that there is nothing weak in seeking help. \\"What we need to do is take the first few steps,\\" Carter said. \\"We need to realize that yes, this is affecting me, and I need to fix this.\\" CNN's Eric Marrapodi, Jennifer Rizzo and Andy Segal contributed to this report. |||||Summary:","completion":"Army Staff Sgt. Ty Carter was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions during the Battle of Kamdesh in Afghanistan. His courage and selfless actions in rescuing his fellow soldiers in the face of imminent death has made him one of America's greatest heroes. Despite being seen as a humble and quiet person, Carter recounts the events of the battle and discusses his struggles with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Upon receiving the Medal of Honor, he wants to use the recognition to raise awareness about the wounds of war, both visible and unseen, and advocate for mental health support for veterans. Carter is the second Medal of Honor recipient from the Battle of Kamdesh, joining Clint Romesha, who received his award earlier in the year. Carter's story highlights his struggles with PTSD, his openness about seeking help, and his desire to help others who are struggling, showing the reality many soldiers face in the aftermath of their service. He hopes that by sharing his story, people will see the nation's highest military honor being awarded to someone who isn't just a hero but is also struggling to deal with the effects of their experiences on the battlefield. Carter's focus on using his medal as a platform to raise awareness for the wounds of war directly appeals to the emotions of his audience, reinforcing his story of heroism and his ultimate message of hope for those facing similar struggles."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

In this task, you're given a fill-in-the-blank question that contains two object names. Additionally, you're given one answer which is one of the objects present in the question. In this task, you need to minimally change the given question so that the answer flips to another object in the question. Remember the question has to be about both objects which are related but different; for example, \\"trophy\\" and \\"suitcase\\". This task typically involves replacing one word i.e., the 'trigger word' with its antonym (e.g., changing from \\"small\\" to \\"big\\"). You should not change any content in the given question beyond a word or two, i.e., the trigger word/phrase. The expected answer to your question must not be associated with just the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in the question. The expected answer should not be ambiguous. For your question, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. In your generated question, retain the object names from the input question.

Poverty, hard work, and even the fact that Father March was away with the Union armies could not down the spirits of Meg, Jo, Amy, and Marmee, as the March girls called their mother. The March sisters tried to be good but had their share of faults. Pretty Meg was often displeased with the schoolchildren she taught; boyish Jo was easy to become angry; golden-haired schoolgirl Amy liked to show up; but Beth, who kept the house, was loving and gentle always. The happy days passed and darkness came when a telegram arrived for Mrs. March. \\"Your husband is very ill,\\" it said, \\"come at once.\\" The girl tried to be brave when their mother left for the front. They waited and prayed. Little Beth got scarlet fever when she was taking care of the sick neighbor. She became very ill but began to recover by the time Marmee was back. When Father came home from the front and at that joyful Christmas dinner they were once more all together. Three years later the March girls had grown into young womanhood. Meg became Mrs. Brooke, and after a few family troubles got used to her new state happily. Jo had found pleasure in her literary efforts. Amy had grown into a young lady with a talent for design and an even greater one for society. But Beth had never fully regained her health, and her family watched her with love and anxiety. Amy was asked to go and stay in Europe with a relative of the Marches. Jo went to New York and became successful in her writing and had the satisfaction of seeing her work published there. But at home the bitterest blow was yet to fall. Beth had known for some time that she couldn't live much longer to be with the family and in the spring time she died. News came from Europe that Amy and Laurie, the grandson of a wealthy neighbor, had planned to be married soon. Now Jo became ever more successful in her writing and got married to Professor Bhaer and soon afterwards founded a school for boys.

Both species are searching for Selene: the vampires seek justice for the death of Viktor, while the Lycans, led by Marius, intend to use her to locate Eve, whose blood holds the key to building an army of vampire-werewolf hybrids. Semira, a council member of the Eastern Coven, tells Thomas she wants Selene to be granted clemency and to train the coven's neophyte Death Dealers. She asks Thomas to plead Selene's case before the full council; the plea is successful and the council reluctantly agrees to a pardon in exchange for Selene's help. Selene arrives with David. Semira has Varga, her ally and lover, poison Selene and slaughter the trainees, framing Selene for the atrocity. With Selene in her power, Semira begins draining her blood, which she intends to drink to steal her power. Thomas and David attempt a rescue, but are attacked by Semira and Varga. Thomas is killed, but David and Selene escape. The pair takes refuge at the Nordic Coven, pursued by Alexia, an Eastern Coven vampire dispatched by Semira.

The first post-Classical published classification of humans into distinct races seems to be François Bernier's Nouvelle division de la terre par les différents espèces ou races qui l'habitent (\\"New division of Earth by the different species or races which inhabit it\\"), published in 1684. In the 18th century the differences among human groups became a focus of scientific investigation. But the scientific classification of phenotypic variation was frequently coupled with racist ideas about innate predispositions of different groups, always attributing the most desirable features to the White, European race and arranging the other races along a continuum of progressively undesirable attributes. The 1735 classification of Carl Linnaeus, inventor of zoological taxonomy, divided the human race Homo sapiens into continental varieties of europaeus, asiaticus, americanus, and afer, each associated with a different humour: sanguine, melancholic, choleric, and phlegmatic, respectively.

The details provided mention her work in films such as \\"Date Movie\\" (2006), \\"Click\\" (2006), and \\"Spring Breakdown\\" (2009). While it is possible that she may have appeared in a movie in 2007, there is no direct mention of any specific films from that year. Sophie Monk's career has spanned various fields, from music to acting to modeling and radio. Born in England and raised in Australia, Sophie got her start with the girl group Bardot, which formed in 1999 after she participated in the Australian reality TV show \\"Popstars.\\" Bardot achieved success in Australia and even had a top-five single in the UK. However, the group disbanded in 2002. Following her time with Bardot, Monk pursued a solo career in music, releasing her debut solo album, \\"Calendar Girl,\\" in 2003. The album featured a mix of pop and dance tracks and received moderate success in Australia. In addition to her music career, Sophie Monk has made a name for herself as an actress. After appearing in Australian TV shows and films, she transitioned to Hollywood with roles in films like \\"Date Movie\\" (2006) and \\"Click\\" (2006), opposite Adam Sandler. In \\"Date Movie,\\" Sophie took on a comedic role, playing the character of Andy, while in \\"Click,\\" she portrayed Stacy, a flirtatious secretary. The following years saw her appear in other films, including the comedy \\"Spring Breakdown\\" (2009), where she starred alongside Amy Poehler, Rachel Dratch, and Parker Posey.

Question: Question: What is the biological purpose of eating breakfast? Options: - halitosis - fullness - overeating - gas - gain energy Explain why a human would choose \\"gain energy\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"\\"Gain energy\\" is the most appropriate answer because breakfast is essentially an energy source. The human body requires energy to function optimally, including for physical activity and cognitive functioning. Breakfast literally means \\"breaking the fast\\" as it's the first meal you eat after several hours of sleep, essentially a long fast. At night, while you sleep, your body is still operating and using up energy as the body's essential metabolic functions continue. By the time you wake up in the morning, the body's glucose levels usually drop which need to be replenished to 'jump start' the day. Eating healthy food in the morning supplies your body with necessary nutrients and refuels your body's glucose levels which are vital for brain functionality and muscle operation. This is what gives the body energy to carry out activities throughout the day. So, this is why a human would choose 'gain energy' to answer the question related to the biological purpose of eating breakfast. It refuels the body after a long period of fasting (sleep) and provides necessary energy for the day. None of the other options like 'halitosis', 'fullness', 'overeating' or 'gas' refer to the fundamental biological process connected to breakfast."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Should I validate this answer? Answer:","completion":"No, you should not validate this answer as it does not accurately address the question asked. The question is about the annual income of Steve Jobs, but the suggested answer discusses his health issues and does not provide any information on his earnings. To provide a more accurate and detailed response, let me clarify that Steve Jobs passed away on October 5, 2011, so he is no longer earning income. However, during his lifetime, his earnings varied depending on his different roles and involvement in various companies like Apple Inc. and Pixar Animation Studios. As co-founder and CEO of Apple Inc., Steve Jobs' annual salary was famously limited to 1 per year since 1997. However, this does not reflect his total compensation, as he also held substantial equity in the company in the form of stocks and stock options. At the time of his death, Jobs held 5.5 million shares of Apple stock and 138 million shares of Disney, which he gained from the acquisition of Pixar by Disney in 2006. The value of these shares and dividends generated significantly higher wealth for Jobs than his nominal annual salary. In summary, it would be more accurate to say that Steve Jobs' annual income varied during his lifetime and was mostly attributed to his stock ownership in Apple Inc. and Pixar/Disney, rather than his nominal salary of 1 per year."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: What would we do without humour? How would we enjoy speaking with others if we did not use humour to invite a smile or a laugh? And how would we manage in times when we feel sad and lonely? Using humour we lighten up each day, and we find common ground with others. We build healthy relationships with others by knowing what to say and what to do. When our use of humour is successful, we build trust and cooperation. We discover that we are not alone, we learn to accept our mistakes, and we look for the good in others and in ourselves. Most importantly, we create common ground, as humour is an essential skill needed to communicate well with others. A few well-chosen words get the attention of others and make a serious point without their getting defensive . Whether we prefer to be the centre of attention or to be shy and quiet, humour can be adjusted to suit our personality. However, when we lose our sense of humour, we often get critical or defensive, and we blame others or ourselves for what was said, and how it was said. To ensure that our humour is welcomed by others, we need to combine our humour with speaking clearly and listening effectively. Have you ever noticed that successful individuals often use self-depreciating humour to humble themselves, without putting themselves down? These individuals understand that every person has strengths and weaknesses and that self-depreciating humour invites others to feel more confident and equal. In this way, humour is the shortest distance between two people. Humour is the spice of life, as it brings happiness, numbs pain and it makes us speak and listen well.

While the app has its merits, it falls somewhat short of excellence, which is why I am awarding it three stars. Pros: 1. Comprehensive content: The app covers a wealth of information ranging from weapon trees, armor sets, quest details, and monster stats to skills, item locations, and even Palico support moves. For a hardcore Monster Hunter fan, the material is certainly appreciated and helps in strategizing against the game's numerous enemies. 2. Easy navigation: Finding information within the app is quite intuitive, with a simple menu layout that allows for speedy access to key sections. The search function is efficient and filters results based on user input, providing the most relevant data promptly. 3. Offline access: One of the highlights of the app is that it can be accessed offline, which is perfect during commutes or in areas with limited internet connectivity. It ensures that users can consult the guide anytime they need help. Cons: 1. Outdated and incomplete information: Although the app offers plenty of data, some crucial details are either missing or outdated. Several weapon trees and armor sets seem to be incomplete, and newer DLCs or game patches are not always accounted for in the database. This can lead to confusion and restrict gameplay progress, as players may rely on incorrect information. 2. Performance issues: The app suffers from occasional crashes, hangs, and slow loading times, which could prove irritating, especially in a time-sensitive gaming scenario. This seems to be an underlying issue that requires urgent attention. 3. Visual presentation: The overall design of the app can be improved. As it stands, the interface and images in the app appear dull and lacking in vibrancy. This, coupled with the occasional pixelation and low-resolution images, can make consulting the app less appealing than it could be. In conclusion, com.ghstudios.android.mhgendatabase does offer numerous benefits to its users, providing them with much-needed guidance in the complex and immersive world of Monster Hunter Generations. That being said, the app would benefit from improvements in its content quality, performance, and aesthetics to provide a seamless experience and maintain its relevancy in the ever-evolving gaming environment. A solid three-star app with the potential to be exceptional should these concerns be addressed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer the above question based on the context below: In 1898 and again in 1899 Norman Heathcote visited the islands and wrote a book about his experiences. During the 19th century, steamers had begun to visit Hirta, enabling the islanders to earn money from the sale of tweeds and birds' eggs but at the expense of their self-esteem as the tourists regarded them as curiosities. It is also clear that the St Kildans were not so naïve as they sometimes appeared. \\"For example, when they boarded a yacht they would pretend they thought all the polished brass was gold, and that the owner must be enormously wealthy\\". The boats brought other previously unknown diseases, especially tetanus infantum, which resulted in infant mortality rates as high as 80 percent during the late 19th century. The cnatan na gall or boat-cough, an illness that struck after the arrival of a ship off Hirta, became a regular feature of life.By the early 20th century, formal schooling had again become a feature of the islands, and in 1906 the church was extended to make a schoolhouse. The children all now learned English and their native Scottish Gaelic. Improved midwifery skills, denied to the island by John Mackay, reduced the problems of childhood tetanus. From the 1880s, trawlers fishing the north Atlantic made regular visits, bringing additional trade. Talk of an evacuation occurred in 1875 during MacKay's time as minister, but despite occasional food shortages and a flu epidemic in 1913, the population was stable at between 75 and 80, and no obvious sign existed that within a few years the millennia-old occupation of the island was to end.

Colorado theater shooter James Holmes remains in a prison outside Colorado, after being transferred earlier this year. A Colorado Department of Corrections spokeswoman said Thursday that state prison officials used the \\"interstate corrections compact\\" to move Holmes out of state. \\"He is not in the state,\\" said Laurie Kilpatrick, a CDOC spokeswoman. Kilpatrick would not say where Holmes was transferred, sometime before mid-January, citing safety concerns. Holmes is serving a life without parole sentence for killing 12 people and injuring 70 others when he opened fire in a crowded Aurora movie theater in 2012. Several victims testified during Holmes' sentencing that they didn't want him imprisoned in California, closer to his parents who live near San Diego. More than 100 former Colorado prisoners are serving sentences out of state as part of the interstate compact, Kilpatrick said. Kieran Nicholson: 303-954-1822, knicholson@denverpost.com or @kierannicholson ||||| Ask any corrections officer: Guarding high-profile criminals is one of the most difficult parts of the job. Not because the most notorious are more dangerous than the rest, but because other inmates know that one way to get famous is to go after the infamous. Serial cannibal Jeffrey Dahmer found that out in a Wisconsin prison twenty years ago, and the con who beat him to death, Christopher Scarver, drew so much attention that he had to be transferred to Colorado. As we first reported in September, Aurora theater shooter James Holmes was quietly shipped to the Colorado State Penitentiary after his sentencing without even his name surfacing in the Department of Corrections database, to begin serving his sentence of life without parole. But his presence there soon generated buzz among other inmates, in part because he was the only occupant of a sixteen-man pod, presumably for his own protection. Yet even being isolated in his own unit within the state's highest-security prison wasn't enough to keep Holmes from being a target. On October 8, as he was leaving a case manager's office, Holmes was attacked by an inmate who'd slipped through a sliding door past a group being taken from a class to a day hall — a brief encounter that was announced by the attacker himself in a boastful letter to the Denver Post. But Mark \\"Slim\\" Daniels, a 27-year-old doing time for menacing, auto theft and other crimes, is concerned that people still don't understand his motives in assaulting Holmes. In a recent letter to Westword, he claims to have been acting as a kind of ad hoc avenger for the Aurora shootings. ||||| Colorado movie theater shooter James Holmes was not supposed to interact with other prisoners, but after a security gate was left open at just the wrong time, another inmate snatched an opportunity to attack the mass killer in the state penitentiary, even throwing punches as guards tried to pull the two apart, according to documents and a top prison official who spoke exclusively to ABC News. Interested in ? Add as an interest to stay up to date on the latest news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest Though officials insisted it was a minor incident, prison higher-ups said the episode proved Holmes was in so much jeopardy that he had to be secretly transferred out of state to an undisclosed location in what one critic called a highly unusual move. “We had not allowed Holmes at that time to come into daily contact with other offenders,” Colorado Prisons Director Steve Hager said in an exclusive interview in February. “That was not part of the management plan of him.” Hager explained that “the attack was part of the reason for moving him. There were many concerns; the attack was part of the concern.” Colorado Dept. of Corrections Hager said Holmes, 28, was not supposed to cross paths with anyone but prison staff while housed in the Colorado State Penitentiary in Canon City. But documents obtained by ABC News show that, as Holmes exited the office of his case manager on Oct. 8, a prison staffer opened a sliding gate without realizing he was putting Holmes in close proximity with another inmate, convicted car thief Mark “Slim” Daniels. The officer escorting Holmes was unable to radio the officer controlling the gate “as his battery had gone dead,” according to a so-called “intelligence assessment” drafted after the incident occurred. With the sliding gate opened and Holmes within striking distance, Daniels, according to the reports, “ran through the slider, squeezing through as it was closing toward offender Holmes … Offender Daniels began hitting offender Holmes, in and around his head, with his fist.” The documents paint a picture of a brief but frenzied incident with officers shouting “No. Don’t do it,” while “Daniels kept swinging over the top of [one officer’s] head, still hitting offender Holmes.” The officer escorting Holmes wrote that Daniels “landed at least two blows to offender Holmes before I was able to get behind” him. Officers struggled to pull Daniels off Holmes but eventually got him to the ground. In the process, Daniels hit a female staffer \\"on the left side of her face below the eye and on the top of her head,” the records say. In a letter to Denver's Westword newspaper in December, Daniels said he regretted not doing more harm to the mass murderer. \\"I'm so sorry I couldn't wipe him out and sent [sic] him packing to Satan's lake of fire,” wrote Daniels, who is serving time for a series of crimes, including auto theft, menacing and forgery. “It was just impossible to do by myself with so many cops. I did get him six or seven good ones… He was very scared.” Hager, the prisons director, agreed to answer questions after ABC News obtained internal records detailing the assault through a formal request from the Colorado Department of Corrections. Even as he acknowledged shortcomings at his facility, Hager insisted that staffers did not make any mistakes or violate department procedures or protocols. No one has been disciplined because of the assault, he said, and no one would be. Glenn Asakawa/Denver Post via Getty Images Despite Holmes’ infamy and the fact he had been housed at the prison more than five weeks, corrections staff still had not determined whether he would be kept in “protective custody” and separate from all other inmates at all times, Hager explained. But he was being held alone in the facility’s Management Control Unit. “At that time, they were trying to find the best placement for him,” Hager said. Hager told ABC News that he did not review the closed-circuit video of the incident, though, he said, “I am sure that it has been monitored by the facility and the facility warden.” When ABC News requested copies of it, the state’s first assistant attorney general, James Quinn, offered a different response, saying “there are no stills and no video.” When the assault occurred, it had been two full months since Holmes had been convicted on Aug. 7 for killing 12 and injuring 70 others when he shot up the Century Aurora 16 cinema in 2012. He was sentenced in late August to serve multiple life sentences behind bars. After word got out that Daniels assaulted Holmes, strangers sent Daniels money and letters of support. Prison officials said his commissary account received 75 and someone was trying to “start a website called ‘James’ Jailhouse Justice.’” Daniels’ mother also established a GoFundMe site to help pay for bills Daniels’ family said are associated with the assault. Because of the incident, Daniels was punished with 60 days in segregation, 45 days loss of privileges and up to 12 months in restrictive housing, Hager said. He has also been moved to Sterling Correctional Facility near the Nebraska border. He's eligible for parole in January. But the most significant result of the incident was Holmes’ secret move to an undisclosed prison. When asked about Holmes’ location, Corrections Department spokeswoman Adrienne Jacobson first said it was public record, though she refused to answer the question. Jacobson later changed her explanation, saying the agreement that allows for the interstate transport of prisoners being held in state custody requires confidentiality. When pressed by ABC News to justify the new secrecy, Jacobson, Hager and other prison officials said the location is being kept a secret, citing only non-specific “security” needs of Holmes, other inmates and staffers. Other states who participate in the interstate-prisoner system as well as the federal government routinely release information concerning the whereabouts of prisoners. For instance, the locations of the five accused of planning the 9/11 attacks and notorious California killer Charles Manson are public record. Local District Attorney George Brauchler, who prosecuted Holmes, said he is disturbed that the killer is being hidden by Colorado authorities, regardless of what transpired inside the penitentiary. “You can Google the federal inmate locator and look up any federal inmate you've ever heard of and find where they're located right at this moment,” Brauchler told ABC News. “Isn't that a tacit admission that the state system is less safe than the federal system? As a Colorado taxpayer and a Coloradoan who had to bear the impact of his mass murder, this guy should be serving a sentence in Colorado. And if not, we should know why and where he is.” Bob Hood, a longtime corrections official who used to run the federal government’s highest-security prison, took issue with the explanations and actions of those in charge of Holmes and the Colorado prison system. “It’s not debatable: Errors were made,” said Hood, a Colorado resident who used to be the warden of the federal Supermax penitentiary in Florence, Colo. “Clearly someone dropped the ball. [The inmates] should never have made contact. At a minimum, it’s a failure of systems -- a very serious breach of security.” Hood said the assault was “simple” and should not have led to the extreme measure of Holmes being transferred to an undisclosed location. “It’s called a ‘dump job,’” Hood said. “Moving him on to another warden. He’s always going to be a target. The [Colorado] Department of Corrections could easily have placed him in a secure setting. It’s ironic to me that they transfer him out of state for such a simple assault. The Department of Corrections dropped the ball. The inmate was assaulted. The system broke down.” ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"Colorado theater shooter James Holmes, who was given a life sentence without parole for killing 12 people and injuring 70 others in the 2012 mass shooting, has been moved to a prison outside of Colorado.

The transfer took place before mid-January, but the specific location has not been disclosed due to safety concerns. Holmes' presence in Colorado State Penitentiary had generated attention among other inmates, prompting concerns for his safety.

The couple's arrival is shrouded in mystery, and their cunning abilities and unorthodox beliefs quickly catch the attention of the townsfolk. Suspicions arise, and soon they find themselves the target of whispered rumors and wild imaginations. Asa and Javuto attempt to live a quiet life, keeping their true nature hidden while secretly practicing their craft. Unfortunately, the superstitious townspeople grow increasingly wary of their presence. Local preacher Reverend Samuel Parris takes particular interest in Asa and Javuto, becoming obsessed with proving their evil deeds and ridding the town of their corruption. Meanwhile, Asa and Javuto secretly use their powers to help the townspeople, healing the sick and improving the lives of those who suffer injustices. Their acts of kindness only serve to increase their reputation as powerful sorcerers, leading to their eventual confrontation with Reverend Parris. When a series of unexplained events and unfortunate accidents occur in the town, Reverend Parris sees his opportunity to act. He gathers a force of loyal followers and has Asa and Javuto arrested for witchcraft. Despite their insistence of innocence and pleas for understanding, the town turns against them. Asa and Javuto are subjected to a harrowing and unfair trial, filled with dramatic courtroom scenes and testimonies from those who have been influenced, for better or worse, by their actions. The tension rises when a surprise witness shares a revelation about Asa and Javuto's true intentions in Salem, casting doubt on their guilt. However, the court is ultimately swayed by Reverend Parris's fear-mongering and manipulation.

In the early years of his career, his then-unorthodox camera angles and style prevented his work from gaining wider recognition. Kertész never felt that he had gained the worldwide recognition he deserved. Today he is considered one of the seminal figures of photojournalism.Expected by his family to work as a stockbroker, Kertész pursued photography independently as an autodidact, and his early work was published primarily in magazines, a major market in those years. This continued until much later in his life, when Kertész stopped accepting commissions. He served briefly in World War I and moved to Paris in 1925, then the artistic capital of the world, against the wishes of his family. In Paris he worked for France's first illustrated magazine called VU. Involved with many young immigrant artists and the Dada movement, he achieved critical and commercial success. Due to German persecution of the Jews and the threat of World War II, Kertész decided to emigrate to the United States in 1936, where he had to rebuild his reputation through commissioned work. In the 1940s and 1950s, he stopped working for magazines and began to achieve greater international success. His career is generally divided into four periods, based on where he was working and his work was most prominently known. They are called the Hungarian period, the French period, the American period and, toward the end of his life, the International period., what would be the answer ?

Identify the key phrases and essential elements in each sentence. 2. Compare the key phrases and essential elements between the sentences. 3. Determine the similarity level based on the comparison. Step 1: Identify the key phrases and essential elements in each sentence. a. Sentence 1: \\"Palestinian President Receives Jordanian Foreign Minister\\" - Key phrase: \\"Palestinian President\\" - Essential element: \\"Receives\\" - Key phrase: \\"Jordanian Foreign Minister\\" b. Sentence 2: \\"Palestinian arrested for sexually harassing young girls\\" - Key phrase: \\"Palestinian\\" - Essential element: \\"arrested\\" - Key phrase: \\"sexually harassing young girls\\" Step 2: Compare the key phrases and essential elements between the sentences. - Both sentences contain the key phrase \\"Palestinian\\". This adds some similarity. - The essential elements in the sentences are different: \\"Receives\\" in sentence 1 while \\"arrested\\" in sentence 2. This decreases similarity. - The second key phrases are not related: \\"Jordanian Foreign Minister\\" in sentence 1 and \\"sexually harassing young girls\\" in sentence 2. This also decreases similarity. Step 3: Determine the similarity level based on the comparison. Based on the above comparison, the sentences have only one related key phrase (\\"Palestinian\\"), but the essential elements and the second key phrases are different. Therefore, I'd rate the similarity between the two sentences as a 1 out of 5.

In the 19th century a different Minneapolis Millers were part of the Western League. The team played first in Athletic Park and later Nicollet Park. The name Minneapolis Millers has been associated with a variety of professional minor league teams. The original Millers date back to 1884 when the Northwestern League was formed. This league failed and the Western League replaced it, absorbing some of the old teams. According to Stew Thornley, this team folded in 1891 due to financial problems. In 1894, another team calling itself the Millers was formed when Ban Johnson and Charles Comiskey revived the Western League in hopes of making it a second major league. The Millers continued to play in the Western League through 1900, when the name was changed to the American League to give it more of a national image. Following the 1900 season, several cities were abandoned for bigger markets in cities recently vacated by the National League, including Minneapolis. Some teams were transferred, as was the case of the Kansas City franchise to become the Washington Nationals (Senators). However, some of the teams were just left out in the dark. It is unclear which of these two paths the Millers took, but most evidence seems to point toward abandonment, not a transfer to Baltimore, especially given that no player for the 1900 Millers played for the 1901 Orioles. - The Minnesota Vikings are an American football team based in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

The state has a large number of lakes, and is known by the slogan \\"Land of 10,000 Lakes\\". Its official motto is \\"L'Étoile du Nord\\" (French: \\"Star of the North\\"). Minnesota is the 12th largest in area and the 21st most populous of the U.S. states; nearly 60 percent of its residents live in the MinneapolisSaint Paul metropolitan area (known as the \\"Twin Cities\\"), the center of transportation, business, industry, education, and government and home to an internationally known arts community. The remainder of the state consists of western prairies now given over to intensive agriculture; deciduous forests in the southeast, now partially cleared, farmed and settled; and the less populated North Woods, used for mining, forestry, and recreation. Minnesota is known for its progressive political orientation and its high rate of civic participation and voter turnout. Until European settlement, Minnesota was inhabited by the Dakota and Ojibwe/Anishinaabe. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the large majority of the European settlers emigrated from Scandinavia and Germany, and the state remains a center of Scandinavian American and German American culture. In recent decades, immigration from Asia, the Horn of Africa, and Latin America has broadened its historic demographic and cultural composition. Minnesota's standard of living index is among the highest in the United States, and the state is also among the best-educated and wealthiest in the nation. - Minneapolis is the county seat of Hennepin County, and larger of the Twin Cities, the 16th-largest metropolitan area in the United States, containing about 3.5 million residents. As of 2015, Minneapolis is the largest city in the state of Minnesota and 46th-largest in the United States with a population of 410,939. Minneapolis and Saint Paul anchor the second-largest economic center in the Midwest, after Chicago. - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody). - The American League of Professional Baseball Clubs, or simply the American League (AL), is one of two leagues that make up Major League Baseball (MLB) in the United States and Canada. It developed from the Western League, a minor league based in the Great Lakes states, which eventually aspired to major league status. It is sometimes called the Junior Circuit because it claimed Major League status for the 1901 season, 25 years after the formation of the National League (the \\"Senior Circuit\\"). - A bus (archaically also omnibus, multibus, motorbus, autobus) is a road vehicle designed to carry many passengers. Buses can have a capacity as high as 300 passengers. The most common type of bus is the single-decker rigid bus, with larger loads carried by double-decker and articulated buses, and smaller loads carried by midibuses and minibuses; coaches are used for longer-distance services. Many types of buses, such as city transit buses and inter-city coaches, charge a fare. Other types, such as elementary or secondary school buses or shuttle buses within a post-secondary education campus do not charge a fare. In many jurisdictions, bus drivers require a special licence above and beyond a regular driver's licence. - The National Football League (NFL) is a professional American football league consisting of 32 teams, divided equally between the National Football Conference (NFC) and the American Football Conference (AFC). The NFL is one of the four major professional sports leagues in North America, and the highest professional level of American football in the world. The NFL's 17-week regular season runs from the week after Labor Day to the week after Christmas, with each team playing 16 games and having one bye week. Following the conclusion of the regular season, six teams from each conference (four division winners and two wild card teams) advance to the playoffs, a single-elimination tournament culminating in the Super Bowl, played between the champions of the NFC and AFC. - The 2010 Major League Baseball season began Sunday, April 4, when the Boston Red Sox defeated their longtime rivals, the 2009 World Series champion New York Yankees at Fenway Park, 97; the regular season ended on October 3. The 2010 All-Star Game was played on July 13 at Angel Stadium of Anaheim in Anaheim, California. The National League ended a 13-game winless streak with a 31 victory. Due to this result, the 2010 World Series began October 27 in the city of the National League Champion, the San Francisco Giants, and ended November 1 when the Giants defeated the American League Champion Texas Rangers in the 2010 World Series, four games to one.

Choose the correct option: In this case, it is best to choose the option of giving the spare ribs a gentle rinse under cold water. Rinsing with boiling water may cook the surface of the ribs, which is not the intention at this stage of the process. Cold water is more suitable for rinsing raw meat, as it helps to maintain its freshness and retains its texture. 2. Prepare the workspace: Clear the sink area and clean the surroundings to ensure a hygienic space for rinsing the spare ribs. Keep a cutting board within reach to place the rinsed ribs onto. 3. Handle ribs with clean hands: Ensure your hands are clean by washing them with warm water and soap before handling the spare ribs. This will minimize the risk of contaminating the meat with harmful bacteria. 4. Rinse the spare ribs under cold water: Hold the spare ribs under the cold tap, allowing the water to flow gently over the meat to rinse away any debris or impurities. Turn the ribs as needed to ensure that all sides are properly rinsed. 5. Pat the ribs dry: Once the ribs have been rinsed, gently pat them dry with paper towels. This will remove any excess water and help the ribs to cook evenly during the recipe process. 6. Transfer the ribs to a cutting board: Place the spare ribs onto a clean cutting board, ready to be used in the recipe.

Question: What rpm was more common than 16 2/3? Context: Some recordings, such as books for the blind, were pressed at 16 2⁄3 rpm. Prestige Records released jazz records in this format in the late 1950s; for example, two of their Miles Davis albums were paired together in this format. Peter Goldmark, the man who developed the 33 1⁄3 rpm record, developed the Highway Hi-Fi 16 2⁄3 rpm record to be played in Chrysler automobiles, but poor performance of the system and weak implementation by Chrysler and Columbia led to the demise of the 16 2⁄3 rpm records. Subsequently, the 16 2⁄3 rpm speed was used for narrated publications for the blind and visually impaired, and were never widely commercially available, although it was common to see new turntable models with a 16 rpm speed setting produced as late as the 1970s.

The second the credits started rolling at the end of “Steve Jobs,” I reached into my purse and did what so many other people in the theater did: I turned on my iPhone. Currently, I’m writing this review on my MacBook Pro. Later this afternoon, once I’ve brought my six-year-old son home from school, I’ll try to deflect his demands to play “Angry Birds Star Wars” on the iPad. So yes, Steve Jobs has changed my life just as he’s changed many millions of others’ on the planet. The devices he devised do what he hoped they would do: They make our lives easier. They are aesthetically appealing. They are our friends. Advertisement Danny Boyle’s thrilling film, which takes place behind the scenes at three key product launches during the late Jobs’ career, begins with the Apple co-founder freaking out minutes before introducing the Macintosh in 1984 because his team couldn’t get it to say “hello.” It was nitpicky and obsessive—qualities he was famous for—but he was also onto something, as we now know: this idea of technology serving as a constant and comforting companion. All of which makes the fact that he was so coldly dismissive to the real-life people closest to him—the people who actually loved him—such a fascinating contradiction, one of many that Boyle, writer Aaron Sorkin and star Michael Fassbender explore with great ambition and élan. He insisted on micromanaging the tiniest details of his presentations—making sure the console was a perfect black cube, down to the millimeter, at the 1988 launch of his failed company, NeXT, or cajoling underlings to ignore fire code by shutting off the exit signs in the theater in hopes of achieving a dramatic darkness for his unveilings. But he couldn’t control who was going to come at him in the moments before he took the stage, or what they would say, or what they would want, or how they would dare to invade his formidable brain to wreak havoc when all he wanted to do was maintain his carefully crafted façade of Zen cool. They include Apple co-founder and old friend Steve Wozniak (played with great intelligence and pathos by Seth Rogen); Apple CEO John Sculley (Jeff Daniels), the one-time father figure who would gain infamy for eventually firing Jobs; and Chrisann Brennan (Katherine Waterston), Jobs’ ex-girlfriend and the mother of his daughter, Lisa, whom he long refused to acknowledge as his or support financially. (All three actresses playing Lisa at various ages give smart, distinctive performances, by the way—Makenzie Moss at 5, Ripley Sobo at 9 and Perla Haney-Jardine at 19.) Advertisement And of course, there is Fassbender himself, who doesn’t really resemble Jobs in any physical way but rather embodies his drive, his restlessness. Fassbender has never shied away from playing damaged or difficult characters—“Shame,” “12 Years a Slave,” even the “X-Men” prequels as a young Magneto—but here, he has the added challenge of playing a revered, real-life figure over the span of 14 years, from long hair and bow tie to glasses and dad jeans. He never flinches from the arrogant and repulsive elements of this man’s behavior, but there’s an intensity to his presence and a directness in his eyes that make him not just compelling but commanding. He doesn’t care whether you like him, and that’s exciting. Through it all is Kate Winslet as Joanna Hoffman, Jobs’ calm yet forceful right-hand woman and a much-needed voice of reason. Winslet gets a couple of great speeches, which she delivers with convincing power, totally unsurprisingly. Her exchanges with Fassbender are the film’s high points and almost a high-wire act; it’s a tricky thing making such dense dialogue sound effortless, but both actors pull it off. This a super-Sorkiny Aaron Sorkin script—full of the kind of well-timed zingers and clever turns of phrase that never occur to us in real life. Rogen gets the best line of all toward the end, one he levels at Jobs in a crowded auditorium before the 1998 iMac launch: “You can be decent and gifted at the same time. It’s not binary.” With self-conscious beauty and piercing insight, it’s a notion that defines the entire film. The energy is relentless and the actors all more than meet the challenge of not only keeping up with Sorkin’s trademark, rat-a-tat patter but also making it sing. But because the movie takes place almost entirely within interiors, the non-stop walking-and-talking—back and forth through hallways, up and down stairways and in and out of doorways—almost plays like a parody of Sorkin’s style, the kind of thing we saw when “The West Wing” was at its peak. Thanks to Boyle’s typically kinetic direction, “Steve Jobs” is certainly never boring. It rarely takes a breath and is crammed with high-tech jargon, but it never feels bogged down. Corridors come to life with imagery. Moments from the past crosscut seamlessly and inform the present, often with overlapping dialogue. And the glare of the lights and thunder of the crowds can be so all encompassing, they make you feel like you were there, too: on the precipice of the future. Advertisement And that’s sort of a fascinating contradiction in itself: that a movie about a guy who was obsessed with sleekness and simplicity should be bursting with verbiage and verve. Having said that, if you don’t know a whole lot about Steve Jobs going into “Steve Jobs,” “Steve Jobs” isn’t about to go out of its way to help you. If you don’t know about the garage in Los Altos, CA where it all began, or his lengthy and tangled friendship with Wozniak, the potential for exploring the complexities of Jobs’ personality might be lost on you. An excellent companion piece would be Alex Gibney’s recent documentary, “Steve Jobs: The Man in the Machine,” which covers much of the same ground, but more thoroughly. (You’re welcome to ignore the 2013 biopic “Jobs” starring Ashton Kutcher, if you haven’t already. But it is rather telling that Jobs’ life has inspired three separate features in just a couple of years.) Sorkin’s script is bold in choosing these pivotal moments in Jobs’ career and structuring them as a three-act play. Certainly it’s far preferable to the standard, superficial, cradle-to-the-grave biopic that tries to encompass too much. It’s easy to imagine “Steve Jobs” as a stage production, actually, for its theatrical talkiness and the minimalism of its set design. It’s also easy to compare Sorkin’s portrayal of Jobs in “Steve Jobs” to his portrayal of Mark Zuckerberg in “The Social Network,” which earned him the adapted-screenplay Oscar in 2011. Both men are visionary geniuses who revolutionized the way people connect with each other, even though they are more than a little socially challenged when it comes to the people in their own lives. The irony may be too rich, but it’s delicious—even though the men in question can be so vicious that their actions leave a bad taste in your mouth. The fact that he doesn’t try to redeem these flawed, fascinating figures—or even try to make you like them in the slightest way—feels like an innovation in itself. ||||| If you're going to interpret on film the searching mind of an indisputable genius, it helps not to make too many dumbass moves. On that basis, score a triumph for Steve Jobs, written, directed and acted to perfection, and so fresh and startling in conception and execution that it leaves you awed. Michael Fassbender rips through the role of the volcanic Apple co-founder and CEO who sucked at personal interaction but soared at transmogrifying personal computing and everything digital from music, animation (Pixar) and publishing to those iPhones we wear like a second skin. Fassbender's Jobs is a tornado of roaring ferocity and repressed feeling. He's also charming and seductively funny, which makes him dangerous if you get too close. Fassbender gives a towering performance of savage wit and limitless firepower. Is he really that good? Hell, yeah. Related 'Steve Jobs' and Why Movies Can't Capture Genius How the biopic on Apple cofounder is the latest film that fails to nail the elusive quality — and why it may not matter The script, by Aaron Sorkin, an Oscar winner for The Social Network, is sheer brilliance. Sorkin didn't so much follow Walter Isaacson's bestselling Jobs biography as absorb it into his DNA and release it with a daring structure and point of view all his own. Sorkin divides the movie into three time frames, each filmed in different formats by the gifted cinematographer Alwin Küchler and each involving the launch of a new Jobs product. The first part, shot on low-res 16mm film, is set in 1984 in Cupertino, California, where Jobs, 29, debuts the Macintosh. The second part, presented on widescreen 35mm, unfurls at the sleek San Francisco Opera House in 1988 when Jobs, axed by Apple, presents his NeXT cube to mass indifference. The final part, utilizing high-def digital, takes place in 1998 at San Francisco's Davies Symphony Hall, where Jobs, back calling the shots at Apple, gives the iMac its famed send-off. Dazed by the tech-speak and whirling innovations? Sorkin offers no sympathy. Echoing Jobs' rush to the next big thing, Sorkin counts on you to keep up. It's a challenge worth taking. Cheers to master filmmaker Danny Boyle (Slumdog Millionaire, Trainspotting, 127 Hours) for directing Sorkin's three-act play with the hurtling speed of a white-knuckle thriller. Boyle also knows how to fill the spaces between words so they reveal the emotions of the multitudes who come and go in Jobs' hectic life. Sorkin moves characters around his cinematic chessboard (shades of Birdman) with little regard to whether they were actually present during Jobs' backstage rampages. Still, their actions and reactions have the ring of harsh, abstract truth. The actors could not be better, as they thrust and parry over 14 years with the man who compares himself to Julius Caesar, an emperor surrounded by enemies. A superb Seth Rogen finds the bruised heart in Steve \\"Woz\\" Wozniak, the Apple co-founder who can't laugh off Jobs' refusal to credit his team with the success of the Apple II computer. Michael Stuhlbarg shows us the pain in software developer Andy Hertzfeld, who suffers the wrath of Jobs for failing to make the Mac prototype say \\"hello.\\" And Jeff Daniels, an iconic Sorkin interpreter on HBO's The Newsroom, nails every nuance as John Sculley, the Apple CEO who fires Jobs and sparks his cruel revenge. Can anyone tame this perfectionist beast? Polish-born marketing chief Joanna Hoffman comes close. As played by the glorious Kate Winslet, award-caliber and radiating grit and grace, Hoffman is the one person ready to give shit to the boss. She berates Moneybags for letting his former lover Chrisann Brennan (Katherine Waterston) live on welfare and for denying paternity of their five-year-old daughter, Lisa (Makenzie Moss). Nine-year-old Lisa (Ripley Sobo) gets closer to the old man. But it's not until 19-year-old Lisa (a stellar Perla Haney-Jardine) fights her controlling, withholding dad on his terms that Jobs takes his first real steps toward her. Related PHOTOS: Reality Bites: The 25 Best and Worst Biopics From raging bulls to lizard kings, we look back at the great (and the grating) movies that took on true-life stories Sorkin never goes soft on his protagonist, an adopted child with an ugly streak built to keep those closest to him at a distance. But Fassbender lets us see flickers of humanity. What we don't see is the older, even richer Jobs who married Laurene Powell, had three children, created more Apple miracles, fought the pancreatic cancer eating away at his body and died in 2011 at age 56. Steve Jobs the movie aims to catch the man at three public points when people who defined their lives in relation to his showed up at the last minute to give him holy hell. Harsh? Yes. But essential to a film about a pioneer who created products with a slick, spotless veneer to hide all the tangled circuits inside. In Steve Jobs, sure to rank with the year's very best films, we see the circuits without ever diminishing the renegade whose vision is still changing our digital lives. ||||| I don’t know how much the tormented, loquacious, obsessive-compulsive dad played by Michael Fassbender in writer Aaron Sorkin and director Danny Boyle’s riveting three-act backstage drama “Steve Jobs” resembles the actual co-founder of Apple, the guy who made technology feel like an extension of the human personality rather than its antiseptic antidote. I also don’t know how much that matters. Not to draw an invidious comparison right off the bat, but how much did Shakespeare’s “Henry V” have to do with the historical monarch who fought the battle of Agincourt? This film and Alex Gibney’s highly critical but richly nuanced recent documentary “Steve Jobs: The Man in the Machine” barely seem to be about the same person, and brush against each other in only the most cursory ways. But the Boyle-Sorkin “Steve Jobs” is not a hagiography or a whitewashing. In fact, it’s not a biopic at all. Although I found Fassbender’s performance magnetic – the Irish actor gradually becomes Jobs, through some mysterious metamorphosis, despite looking almost nothing like him – the character we see backstage before three major product launches is frequently downright unpleasant and almost never resembles the sympathetic and “relatable” protagonist typically demanded by major motion pictures. If you find Steve Jobs relatable, you may need professional help. Just as “The Social Network” was not about Facebook, “Moneyball” was not about the Oakland Athletics and “The West Wing” was not about the White House, “Steve Jobs” is not really about Steve Jobs or Apple Computer. Like nearly all of Sorkin’s work in movies and television, it’s about the moral interaction between public performance and private behavior, and about the difficulty many driven and talented people have in treating other human beings as if they mattered. Quite likely it’s a self-portrait to some degree, although there I lapse into exactly the kind of amateur psychoanalysis that Sorkin will cheerfully tell you he indulges in every time he sits down to write. A few nights ago I moderated a conversation with Sorkin after a screening for the Writers Guild. Before laying out his psychological theory on Jobs – which is essentially that he was a profoundly damaged person who gradually came to understand how damaged he was – Sorkin hauled out a quip he has used many times before. “When I say stuff like this, you need to remember that I do hold a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in musical theater,” he said. “So this isn’t just coming from some guy off the street.” But that gag line contains buried meanings that are not superficial: Sorkin’s writing is always theatrical, and in this screenplay he has essentially boiled down Walter Isaacson’s whopping Jobs biography into a trilogy of one-act plays. And his language is inherently musical: The famous Sorkin “walk and talk,” the overly lyrical expository monologue in which a character reveals his or her driving desires, the zinger comeback uttered while leaving a room, the finely balanced back and forth between a man and a woman. If anything, “Steve Jobs” is so perfectly wrought and meticulously shaped a vessel that it leaves all verisimilitude behind and delivers a dramatic redemption or salvation that Steve Jobs never found in life. For most viewers, that won’t be a problem, and this is simultaneously Sorkin’s most satisfying movie script and Boyle’s most graceful work as a director Many fans of Apple and Jobs were puzzled to learn that Sorkin had taken just three incidents from Isaacson’s authorized biography – three of Jobs’ product launches, yes, but none of the greatest hits. This movie ends in 1998, with Jobs’ return to Apple and the launch of the iMac, the friendly ovoid blob that came in many colors and was described by Jobs’ daughter Lisa (in the movie, at least) as “Judy Jetson’s Easy-Bake Oven.” There is no such thing as an iPhone, still less an iPad, and people who want to listen to music while they walk around have those clunky portable CD players. In one of his final scenes with Lisa, Jobs tells her he’s going to fix that problem, which is probably a bit of Sorkin-esque cheating – the iPod was not launched for another three years. But the structure of “Steve Jobs” makes perfect sense once you understand that Sorkin is essentially not interested in the story of Steve Jobs as a technological innovator or a corporate visionary. He’s looking for moments of dramatic tension and personal crisis in a famous person’s life, and is entirely willing to fictionalize them for effect, as was done in, say, the lives of the saints written by church historians centuries after their deaths. The moral spine of all three episodes in “Steve Jobs” is not Jobs’ relationship to his machines, but his relationships with a “West Wing”-style core group of people around him and especially with Lisa, the illegitimate daughter whom he denied for years and resisted getting to know. In the first act of the film, it’s 1984 and Jobs is preparing to unveil the Macintosh desktop computer at the Flint Center in Cupertino, California – then a relatively obscure Silicon Valley bedroom community, and now famous all over the world as Apple’s hometown. The second chapter takes place four years later at the War Memorial Opera House in San Francisco, after Jobs has been hounded out of Apple and is preparing to launch the NeXT, an overpriced, overdesigned and underpowered cube that was effectively a Trojan horse directed at his former company. Then we skip a full decade, to Jobs’ reconquest of Apple and the iMac launch at Davies Symphony Hall, just across the street. (All the locations are genuine, and it really does make a difference.) Boyle’s design team doesn’t go over the top with the ‘80s and ‘90s styles and signatures – although we certainly see oversize glasses and enormous shoulder pads – but each section of the film has a distinctive visual flavor. For the opening section, in 1984, cinematographer Alwin H. Küchler uses old-school 16mm film, lending the scene a subtle grain and slightly washed-out colors. In 1988, we get the richness and sophisticated color palette of 35mm, and for the late ‘90s Küchler switches to the relentless digital clarity and “contemporary” feeling of the Arri Alexa. There’s a problem with the computer Jobs plans to unveil at the Flint Center: It doesn’t work. At least it doesn’t say “hello,” or not without a little backstage trickery, and Jobs is utterly inflexible on this point. (That part, Sorkin says, is actually true.) As for the Apple founder, who is about to risk his wunderkind reputation on a machine that will be a disastrous failure, he doesn’t want to say hello either. Not to the eager journalists, not to the technical wizards he alternately berates and patronizes – Seth Rogen plays Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, and Michael Stuhlbarg is software genius Andy Hertzfeld – and not to his ex-girlfriend, Chrisanne Brennan (Katherine Waterston) or the little girl he insists is not his daughter. Chrisanne and Woz and Hertzfeld come and go throughout the movie, as each is subjected to Jobs’ baleful glare, and for obvious reasons Lisa is played by a different young actress in each section. Jobs’ confidante and antagonist and external voice of conscience, throughout all three episodes, is Apple marketing head Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet), constantly trying to make the angel-on-shoulder argument that he would still be Steve Jobs even if he stopped treating other people with vicious disregard. If Fassbender is almost never off screen – there are two brief shots where he is not visible – Winslet is present only slightly less, and turns what could have been an overly “womanly” amanuensis role into a steely, angry and ultimately irresistible force of ferocious power and emotion. If there’s an Oscar in this cast, beyond the one for which Fassbender will surely be nominated, it’s hers. Another voice of normalcy from the outside world is supplied by Jeff Daniels as Apple CEO John Sculley, whose role here is largely a Sorkin invention. In real life, Sculley’s famous falling out with Jobs after the Macintosh fiasco of ’84 led first to the latter’s dismissal from Apple and then to the former’s, and the two men never spoke again. Sorkin says he had a lengthy email exchange with Sculley, who is now retired in Florida and has never spoken publicly about his days at Apple, and decided to give him a chance, in dramatic form, to say all the things he wanted to say to Steve Jobs but never did. I’m perfectly fine with that decision, largely because any chance to watch Daniels act is a chance worth taking, and because Sorkin’s concocted confrontations between Jobs and Sculley are richly enjoyable. But it exemplifies the fact that “Steve Jobs” is a work of imagination and reinvention, not of biography or history. It’s a moral survey of American life on the cutting edge of the late 20th century as we wish it had happened (during the administration of President Jed Bartlet, in effect), rather than as it did. It’s a moving and magnificently crafted story about a person named Steve Jobs who was brought low by pride and arrogance and then redeemed by love. It might be a story that mirrors our dreams and desires, which is what the real Steve Jobs did too, and in that sense maybe it’s indirectly about him. It’s definitely not about a guy who built and sold computers. “Steve Jobs” opens this week in New York and Los Angeles, with wider national release to follow, beginning Oct. 23. ||||| \\"Steve Jobs,\\" the man and the film, use Hoffman as a gatekeeper, someone who has a key voice in who gets to see the great man.

Someone who believes \\"you can be decent and gifted at the same time,\\" Wozniak finds, not for the first time, that pushing Jobs to do what he doesn't want to do is fruitless. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"\\"Steve Jobs,\\" directed by Danny Boyle and written by Aaron Sorkin, explores the life of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, focusing on his relationships with the people around him and the careful construction of his public image. The movie takes a bold route, dividing itself into a trilogy of one-act plays, each focusing on the moments before Jobs launched revolutionary products: the Macintosh in 1984, the NeXT cube in 1988, and the iMac in 1998. The performances of the cast, particularly Michael Fassbender as Jobs, provide an insight into the complex minds of Jobs and his colleagues and deliver a gripping backdrop to the world of technology and innovation that he created."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

This bar makes it awkward for the bartenders to be friendly or to even be bartenders. The seats at the bar seem very far from where the bartenders stand. We had trouble getting the bartenders attention and didn't receive friendly service when we did. The drinks we received were as expected and I wasn't sitting in the Flamingo trying to make new friends so the gamblers around me didn't bother me. I enjoy the gambling machines on the bar. I'd rather play on the Bugsy Bar near, also inside the Flamingo near the strip entrance. Friendly bartenders and a more lively atmosphere. Drinks were pretty watered down at both spots, but we bring our own alcohol in Vegas, so they're usually the perfect strength with a little doctoring. Choose the sentiment of this review?

Wait and let gravity work: If the clog isn't too severe, sometimes waiting for a few minutes will allow the water to drain down the pipe, loosening the clog. If this doesn't work, proceed to the next step. 2. Use hot (but not boiling) water: Boil a kettle or pot of water and allow it to cool down for a few minutes, so it's hot but not boiling. Pour the hot water carefully into the toilet bowl, aiming at the drain hole to avoid splashing. The heat from the water can help break apart the clog and facilitate the unclogging process. 3. Use dish soap or shampoo: If the hot water isn't enough, add a generous squirt (approx. half a cup) of dish soap or shampoo into the toilet bowl. The soap will act as a lubricant, helping the clog to slide down the pipe. Let it sit for 10-15 minutes. 4. Use a wire coat hanger: If the clog is still not resolved, you can use a wire coat hanger as a makeshift snake. Unwind the hanger and bend one end so it forms a small hook. Carefully insert the hooked end into the drain hole and use a gentle probing motion to break up the clog. Be cautious not to apply excessive force, as this may damage your toilet. 5. Use a toilet brush or mop: If the coat hanger isn't available or doesn't help, use a toilet brush or wrap a mop head with a plastic bag, securing it with a rubber band. Push the brush or mop into the toilet bowl, aiming for the drain hole. Pump it gently to create pressure that may dislodge the clog. 6. Use baking soda and vinegar: If all else fails, combine one cup of baking soda with one cup of vinegar and pour the mixture into the toilet bowl. The chemical reaction between the baking soda and vinegar may help dissolve the clog. Leave it for 30 minutes, then pour another bucket of hot water into the toilet bowl to flush it and see if the clog has resolved. If the clog persists after trying these methods, it might be a more severe blockage that requires professional assistance from a plumber."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person who was inspired to write a song by the growing tension among the Beatles, using the article: Paul McCartney said he came up with the title \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of his first visits to his property High Park Farm, near Campbeltown in Scotland, which he purchased in June 1966. The phrase was inspired by the sight of a road \\"stretching up into the hills\\" in the remote Highlands surroundings of lochs and distant mountains. He wrote the song at his farm in 1968, inspired by the growing tension among the Beatles. Based on other comments McCartney has made, author Howard Sounes writes, the lyrics can be seen as McCartney expressing his anguish at the direction of his personal life, as well as a nostalgic look back at the Beatles' history. McCartney recalled: \\"I just sat down at my piano in Scotland, started playing and came up with that song, imagining it was going to be done by someone like Ray Charles. I have always found inspiration in the calm beauty of Scotland and again it proved the place where I found inspiration.\\"Once back in London, McCartney recorded a demo version of \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of the recording sessions for The Beatles. Later, he offered the song to Tom Jones on the condition that the singer release it as his next single. In Jones' recollection, he was forced to turn it down since his record company were about to issue \\"Without Love\\" as a single.The song takes the form of a piano-based ballad, with conventional chord changes. McCartney described the chords as \\"slightly jazzy\\" and in keeping with Charles' style. The song's home key is E-flat major but it also uses the relative C minor. Lyrically, it is a sad and melancholic song, with an evocation of an as-yet unrequited, though apparently inevitable, love. In an interview in 1994, McCartney described the lyric more obliquely: \\"It's rather a sad song. I like writing sad songs, it's a good bag to get into because you can actually acknowledge some deeper feelings of your own and put them in it. It's a good vehicle, it saves having to go to a psychiatrist.\\"The opening theme is repeated throughout. The..., what would be the answer ? Answer:","completion":"The answer would be: McCartney.

This article: Balch Creek begins in the Forest Park neighborhood in unincorporated Multnomah County near the intersection of Northwest Skyline Boulevard and Northwest Thompson Road at the crest of the West Hills. It flows generally east about 3.5 miles (5.6 km) to its confluence with the Willamette River, a major tributary of the Columbia River. The creek drops from 1,116 feet (340 m) above sea level at its source to 46 feet (14 m) at its mouth, a total of 1,070 feet (330 m). Most of this occurs in the first 2.5 miles (4.0 km). In the hills, the stream gradient (slope) generally ranges from 15 to 30 percent interspersed with sections of less than 15 percent along the middle reaches.From its source, the creek runs east on private property near Forest Park, a large municipal park in Portland, before turning briefly south about 3 miles (5 km) from the mouth. Soon thereafter, the stream receives an unnamed tributary on the right bank and turns southeast on private property along Northwest Cornell Road. It enters the city and the Audubon Society of Portland simultaneously about 2 miles (3 km) from the mouth, receives two more unnamed tributaries on the right, and flows northeast, entering the part of Forest Park known as Macleay Park.For about 0.25 miles (0.40 km) the creek parallels Wildwood Trail, the main hiking trail in Forest Park, until reaching a former public restroom known as the Stone House. From here Balch Creek runs beside the Lower Macleay Trail, another hiking trail, for about 0.8 miles (1.3 km). Near Northwest Thurman Street, roughly 1 mile (1.6 km) from the mouth, the creek flows through a trash rack into an 84-inch (210 cm) diameter storm sewer. City workers first diverted the creek into a pipe in the early 20th century. The water empties into the Willamette River in the city's Northwest Industrial neighborhood at Outfall 17. About 10 miles (16 km) below this outfall, the Willamette enters the Columbia River. contains an answer for the question: Which body of water flows past the Stone House?, what is it ?

It occurs between particles or objects. It causes them to attract or repel each other. They do not even have to touch. This is unlike the typical push or pull you may be familiar with. All electric charge is based on the protons and electrons in atoms. A proton has a positive electric charge. An electron has a negative electric charge. Forces on Charged Objects Most atoms are balanced electrically. They have the same number of positive and negative charges. Therefore, the number of protons equals the number of electrons. Neutrons do not matter as they have no charge. When an object loses some electrons, it becomes positively charged. There are now more protons than electrons inside the atom. The lost electrons may remain free. Or, they may attach to another object. The new object now has more electrons than protons. It then becomes negatively charged.

Much of her work was published in The New Age under a variety of pseudonyms , and she lived with the editor , A. R. Orage , for a time before the outbreak of the First World War . Bisexual , she was a friend and lover of Katherine Mansfield , whose work was first published in The New Age . Another of her lovers was Wyndham Lewis . Born in London and raised in South Africa , just before the war , she moved to Paris and became a figure in bohemian circles due to her friendship with Max Jacob . She shared an apartment in Montparnasse with Amedeo Modigliani and posed for him as well . Another friend was adventure novelist Charles Beadle , with whom she had several things in common . He grew up in Hackney , spent time in South Africa ( participating in the Boer War as a member of the British South African Police ) , and published several novels about bohemian life in Paris . When Beadle came to America , from Paris , in November 1916 , he listed Hastings as his nearest friend in Paris . Towards the end of her life she felt excluded from the literary recognition she felt her due , and blamed Orage , whom she accused of conspiring to keep her out of literary circles in Britain , and she published a pamphlet , The Old New Age , bitterly criticising him in 1936 . In 1943 , probably suffering from cancer , she killed herself with gas from a domestic cooker . - Philip Mairet (full name: Philippe Auguste Mairet; 18861975) was a designer, writer and journalist. He had a wide range of interest: crafts, Alfred Adler and psychiatry, and Social Credit. He was also a translator of major figures including Sartre. He wrote biographies of Sir Patrick Geddes and A. R. Orage, with both of whom he was closely associated. - The New Age was a British literary magazine, noted for its wide influence under the editorship of A. R. Orage from 1907 to 1922. It began life in 1894 as a publication of the Christian Socialist movement; but in 1907 as a radical weekly edited by Joseph Clayton, it was struggling. In May of that year, Alfred Orage and Holbrook Jackson, who had been running the Leeds Arts Club, took over the journal with financial help from George Bernard Shaw. Jackson acted as co-editor only for the first year, after which Orage edited it alone until he sold it in 1922. By that time his interests had moved towards mysticism, and the quality and circulation of the journal had declined. According to a Brown University press release, \\"\\"The New Age\\" helped to shape modernism in literature and the arts from 1907 to 1922\\". It ceased publication in 1938. Orage was also associated with \\"The New English Weekly\\" (193249) as editor during its first two years of operation (Philip Mairet took over at his death in 1934). - Kathleen Mansfield Murry (nee Beauchamp; 14 October 1888 9 January 1923) was a prominent New Zealand modernist short story writer who was born and brought up in colonial New Zealand and wrote under the pen name of Katherine Mansfield. At 19, Mansfield left New Zealand and settled in the United Kingdom, where she became a friend of modernist writers such as D.H. Lawrence and Virginia Woolf. In 1917 she was diagnosed with extrapulmonary tuberculosis, which led to her death at the age of 34. - George Holbrook Jackson (31 December 1874 16 June 1948) was a British journalist, writer and publisher. He was recognised as one of the leading bibliophiles of his time. - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. - Adeline Virginia Woolf (née Stephen; 25 January 1882 28 March 1941) was an English writer and one of the foremost modernists of the twentieth century. - Tarr is a modernist novel by Wyndham Lewis, written in 190911, revised and expanded in 191415 and first serialized in the magazine \\"The Egoist\\" from April 1916 until November 1917. The American version was published in 1918, with an English edition published by the Egoist Press appearing shortly afterwards; Lewis later created a revised and final version published by Chatto and Windus in 1928. Set in the bohemian milieu of pre-war Paris, it presents two artists, the Englishman Tarr and the German Kreisler, and their struggles with money, women, and social situations. The novel abounds in somewhat Nietzschean themes. Tarr, generally thought to be modelled on Lewis himself, displays disdain for the 'bourgeois-bohemians' around him, and vows to 'throw off humour' which he regardsespecially in its English formas a 'means of evading reality' unsuited to ambition and the modern world. This self-conscious attitude and the situations that it brings about are, ironically, a major source of the novel's pervasive dark humour. Kreisler, a violent German Romantic of protean energy and a failure as an artist, is in many ways the focus of the novel. An indication of the extremity of his vivid portrait is Lewis's own wondering several years later if he had, in Kreisler, anticipated the personality of Hitler. - The Leeds Arts Club was founded in 1903 by the Leeds school teacher Alfred Orage and Yorkshire textile manufacture Holbrook Jackson, and was probably one of the most advanced centres for modernist thinking in Britain in the pre-First World War period. - Percy Wyndham Lewis (18 November 1882 7 March 1957) was an English painter and critic (he dropped the name 'Percy', which he disliked). He was a co-founder of the Vorticist movement in art, and edited the literary magazine of the Vorticists, \\"BLAST\\". His novels include his pre-World War I-era novel \\"Tarr\\" (set in Paris), and \\"The Human Age\\", a trilogy comprising \\"The Childermass\\" (1928), \\"Monstre Gai\\" and \\"Malign Fiesta\\" (both 1955), set in the afterworld. A fourth volume of \\"The Human Age\\", \\"The Trial of Man,\\" was begun by Lewis but left in a fragmentary state at the time of his death.

Answer the question...when did the internet first become available to the public??","completion":"In order to answer the question about when the internet first became available to the public, I will take the following steps: Step 1: Define the Internet The internet, as we understand it today, is a global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to communicate. Step 2: Identify key milestones in the development of the Internet - ARPANET (1960s): The earliest form of the Internet was ARPANET, developed by the United States Department of Defense in the late 1960s. - TCP/IP (1983): ARPANET adopted the TCP/IP protocol suite on January 1, 1983, and this marked the beginning of the modern Internet. Step 3: Determine when the Internet became accessible to the general public - World Wide Web (WWW): The WWW, invented by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in 1989, is a system of interlinked hypertext documents that are accessed through the Internet using web browsers. The invention of the World Wide Web is what truly made the Internet accessible and practical for the general public. - Public availability of the WWW: In August 1991, Tim Berners-Lee publicly announced the World Wide Web, making it available for public use. Based on these steps, I can conclude that the Internet, as we know it today, became available to the public in August 1991 when the World Wide Web was publicly announced by Sir Tim Berners-Lee."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Two touchdown runs by Bengal running back Rudi Johnson put the game out of reach. The Browns scored one more touchdown with quarterback Charlie Frye's 2-yard run, but it was not enough as the Bengals improved to 2-0. Several Bengals were injured during this game. David Pollack, a 2nd year linebacker, suffered a non-paralyzing broken neck (fracturing his C6 vertebra), and would miss the rest of the season. Safety Dexter Jackson suffered a severe ankle sprain.

So what next for Jones and his side as they try and hunt down the world champions? Head coach Eddie Jones captured the mood of an excited nation after England completed an historic 3-0 whitewash in Australia, just months after sealing a first Grand Slam in 13 years. \\"I'm sure that everyone at home who watched the three Tests can't wait to see us play in November,\\" the Australian said. \\"They must be lining up at Twickenham now trying to get seats.\\" Next up for England are the autumn Tests against South Africa, Fiji, Argentina and Australia. Jones says England were too inconsistent across the series, best illustrated by the lax defensive displays in the first and third Test matches. Defence coach Paul Gustard will be tasked with ensuring the heroic rearguard effort in the second Test in Melbourne was not a one-off. \\"We've got a lot of hard work ahead of us,\\" Jones told BBC Sport after Saturday's 44-40 victory in Sydney. \\"We have serious deficiencies in our consistency, but that will come with time and with more detailed practice. \\"The All Blacks beat Wales by a big score, which just shows their incredible relentlessness. We don't have that yet but that's where we are aiming to go.\\" Jones will be aware that the Wallabies were hampered in the series by injury and unavailability, and the players acknowledge there is plenty to work on. \\"We are not the finished article by any means,\\" said scrum-half Ben Youngs. \\"We have got to kick on from where we are.\\" Media playback is not supported on this device Before the Six Nations, Jones said England lacked \\"world-class players\\", so have any of his charges elevated themselves to that level since then? \\"[Number eight] Billy Vunipola was absolutely outstanding, while his brother Mako really came through on this tour,\\" Jones said. \\"I thought Owen [Farrell] and George [Ford] really grew as guys who could control a game, they knew when to run, knew when to kick, and knew when to pass. So they are the guys that really stood out.\\" Jones also had special praise for prop Dan Cole, who has been another key performer for England after a difficult World Cup, while flankers James Haskell and Chris Robshaw were also outstanding and lock Maro Itoje has continued his staggering development. Farrell scored an astonishing 66 points in the series, nailing 23 out of his 26 kicks at goal in the process. At the start of the season the debate was whether Farrell or Ford should play at fly-half; this tour has shown that there must be a place for Farrell in the starting XV, regardless of the number on his back. The Saracen has been compared to all-time great Jonny Wilkinson by the Australian media because of his relentless accuracy from the tee and, if he stays fit, chasing down Wilkinson's England points record is not unfeasible. But while Jones has spoken in the past of his desire for a big ball-carrier at inside-centre - Luther Burrell started the series in Brisbane - it will now be hard to break up the Ford and Farrell combination at 10 and 12, with both players excelling down under. The two could become \\"legends of the game\\" according to skills coach Glen Ella, and it would be a surprise if they both don't start in the autumn. However, Jones will have options in the midfield: Manu Tuilagi will be drafted back into the squad if he can finally avoid injury, while Northampton's Harry Mallinder caught the eye as he led the England to the World Rugby Under 20 Championship at the weekend. Then there is Ben Te'o, who didn't feature in the tour down under, but will be playing in the Premiership next season with Worcester. While urging his players to improve, Jones is looking to do likewise, and will spend time with the Orica GreenEDGE team at next month's Tour de France in the belief he must develop as a coach if England are to the top the world rankings. \\"I'm keen to have a look at what they do because I've got to get better,\\" he said. \\"If the team's not consistent, then our coaching's not good enough. You can never take your foot off the pedal.\\" England don't play New Zealand until 2017 at the earliest, and while supporters would love to see the side's resurgence tested against the best in the world, the schedule does present England with a genuine chance of going through 2016 unbeaten. South Africa, Fiji, Argentina and Australia visit Twickenham in the autumn, with all four matches eminently winnable. It may be that England have won 12 from 12 ahead of a rematch with the Wallabies on the first weekend of December. \\"Absolutely, there's no reason we can't [win every match],\\" said Youngs. \\"But there is a lot of rugby to be played between now and then. It's an exciting time for England rugby, and I feel very privileged to have been a part of this tour party.\\" \\"English rugby is in a good place,\\" reflected captain Dylan Hartley. \\"We were in a dark place maybe six months ago, and I hope we have now given the people something to cheer about.\\" Find out how to get into rugby union with our special guide.

They were introduced by gallery owner John Dunbar. Lennon was intrigued by Ono's \\"Hammer A Nail\\": patrons hammered a nail into a wooden board, creating the art piece. Although the exhibition had not yet begun, Lennon wanted to hammer a nail into the clean board, but Ono stopped him. Dunbar asked her, \\"Don't you know who this is? He's a millionaire! He might buy it.\\" Ono had supposedly not heard of the Beatles, but relented on condition that Lennon pay her five shillings, to which Lennon replied, \\"I'll give you an imaginary five shillings and hammer an imaginary nail in.\\" Ono subsequently related that Lennon had taken a bite out of the apple on display in her work Apple, much to her fury.Ono began to telephone and visit Lennon at his home. When Cynthia asked him for an explanation, Lennon explained that Ono was only trying to obtain money for her \\"avant-garde bullshit\\". While his wife was on holiday in Greece in May 1968, Lennon invited Ono to visit. They spent the night recording what would become the Two Virgins album, after which, he said, they \\"made love at dawn\\". When Lennon's wife returned home she found Ono wearing her bathrobe and drinking tea with Lennon who simply said, \\"Oh, hi.\\" Ono became pregnant in 1968 and miscarried a male child on 21 November 1968, a few weeks after Lennon's divorce from Cynthia was granted.Two years before the Beatles disbanded, Lennon and Ono began public protests against the Vietnam War. They were married in Gibraltar on 20 March 1969, and spent their honeymoon at the Hilton Amsterdam, campaigning with a week-long Bed-In for Peace. They planned another Bed-In in the United States but were denied entry, so they held one instead at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel in Montreal, where they recorded \\"Give Peace a Chance\\".

Later, they planned to continue this performance in the United States, but after being denied entry, they held the event at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel in Montreal. Throughout these public protests and peace advocacy work, the couple often incorporated elements of performance art. This is seen in their concept of \\"Bagism,\\" which was first introduced during a press conference in Vienna. Even prior to their marriage, Lennon and Ono shared a deep connection with each other—a relationship that began shaping soon after their first meeting at a gallery exhibition in London, and that continued to evolve in the years that followed.

Summarize this article: A report from a high-volume single center indicated a survival benefit of receiving a kidney transplant from an HLA-incompatible live donor as compared with remaining on the waiting list, whether or not a kidney from a deceased donor was received. The generalizability of that finding is unclear. In a 22-center study, we estimated the survival benefit for 1025 recipients of kidney transplants from HLA-incompatible live donors who were matched with controls who remained on the waiting list or received a transplant from a deceased donor (waiting-list-or-transplant control group) and controls who remained on the waiting list but did not receive a transplant (waiting-list-only control group). We analyzed the data with and without patients from the highest-volume center in the study. Recipients of kidney transplants from incompatible live donors had a higher survival rate than either control group at 1 year (95.0%, vs. 94.0% for the waiting-list-or-transplant control group and 89.6% for the waiting-list-only control group), 3 years (91.7% vs. 83.6% and 72.7%, respectively), 5 years (86.0% vs. 74.4% and 59.2%), and 8 years (76.5% vs. 62.9% and 43.9%) (P<0.001 for all comparisons with the two control groups). The survival benefit was significant at 8 years across all levels of donor-specific antibody: 89.2% for recipients of kidney transplants from incompatible live donors who had a positive Luminex assay for anti-HLA antibody but a negative flow-cytometric cross-match versus 65.0% for the waiting-list-or-transplant control group and 47.1% for the waiting-list-only control group; 76.3% for recipients with a positive flow-cytometric cross-match but a negative cytotoxic cross-match versus 63.3% and 43.0% in the two control groups, respectively; and 71.0% for recipients with a positive cytotoxic cross-match versus 61.5% and 43.7%, respectively. The findings did not change when patients from the highest-volume center were excluded. This multicenter study validated single-center evidence that patients who received kidney transplants from HLA-incompatible live donors had a substantial survival benefit as compared with patients who did not undergo transplantation and those who waited for transplants from deceased donors.

Surgeon Karim Zalazun looks at a monitor displaying a donor kidney for patient Adam Abernathy, who participated in a five-way organ transplant swap, in New York, August 1, 2012. REUTERS/Keith Bedford A long-term study found that transplant recipients whose immune systems were technically incompatible to the donated kidney - because they had so-called anti-HLA antibodies - were more likely to be alive eight years later than people who did not receive a transplant or waited to get an organ from a deceased donor. “We used to say if you had a compatible donor, you could do a transplant. Now you can say, if you have an incompatible donor, we still can make that transplant happen,” senior author Dr. Dorry Segev of John Hopkins University in Baltimore told Reuters Health. “That’s very exciting to those on the waiting list.” Eight-year survival rates were almost 77 percent for 1,025 people who received an HLA-incompatible kidney from a live donor, 63 percent for 5,125 matched patients who remained on a waiting list for a kidney or received a kidney from a deceased donor and 44 percent for 5,125 people who remained on the waiting list without receiving a kidney. “The paper is showing how much longer the patient will live compared to their next available option,” said Segev, who directs John Hopkins’ Epidemiology Research Group in Organ Transplantation. “Your next best option is waiting on the list for a compatible donor, and a lot of those patients will never find one.” The study was done at 22 centers. It could help the more than 32,000 people in the United States who have anti-HLA antibodies and need a transplant. “It’s all about timing,” said Dr. Sanjay Kulkarni, director of kidney and pancreas transplantation at Yale-New Haven Hospital and the Yale School of Medicine, who was not involved in the research. “The longer people are on dialysis before they have a transplant, the worse their survival,” he said. “So if you have a living donor, instead of waiting five years for a compatible donor, if you can get a transplant from an incompatible donor in a couple of months, this paper suggests that that is beneficial, despite the fact that they have a higher rate of rejection,” he told Reuters Health. “The implications of these results are revolutionary, especially when the numerous contradictory opinions raised by the transplant community are considered,” said Drs. Lionel Rostaing and Paolo Malvezzi of the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Grenoble Alpes in La Tronche, France, in an editorial accompanying the study in the New England Journal of Medicine. Desensitizing recipients can be very expensive, they said, and the immunosuppressive regimens required carry the potential of infection and cancer. In addition, living donors face a small but significant increase in their risk of end stage renal disease. Nonetheless, Rostaing and Malvezzi write, using incompatible kidneys from living donors “may save lives and may be cost-effective over time.” There is an added cost, but it is relatively small, Segev said. Each patient’s immune system has to be desensitized to accept the incompatible kidney. Depending on antibody levels, “it can take a few days to a couple of weeks,” he said. “But compared to the cost of a transplant, it’s relatively low. If a transplant costs perhaps 100,000 and you add desensitization, it might be 110,000 to 120,000.” There’s the additional cost of 10,000 or so each year for drugs to keep the immune system from rejecting the kidney. “But compared to 100,000 a year f dialysis,” he said, a transplant quickly becomes cost effective over time. Kulkarni cautioned that the organ donation system was changed just over two years ago to make it easier for hard-to-match patients to get a kidney from a deceased donor. Now “people are getting transplanted much quicker” so today’s survival rates may not be as dramatically different as they are in the new study, he said. “But I bet they still hold.” SOURCE: bit.ly/24R0D0j New England Journal of Medicine, online March 9, 2016. ||||| Summary:","completion":"A new study from the New England Journal of Medicine reveals that transplanting a mismatched kidney from a living donor may lower the risk of death more than not doing a transplant at all.

Movie plot title: Invincible Movie plot: Zishe Breitbart (Jouko Ahola) is the son of an Orthodox Jewish blacksmith in rural Poland. He is fantastically strong, largely from working at hard labor all day. A talent agent sees how strong Breitbart is in his Jewish shtetl home and convinces him to move to Berlin, where he can find work as a strongman. Hanussen (Tim Roth), an epic con-man and supposed mystic, runs a cabaret variety show. Hanussen gives Breitbart a blonde wig and a Nordic helmet and calls him \\"Siegfried\\" so as to identify him with the Aryan notion of physical superiority. This appeals to the largely Nazi clientele, and he is a big hit. This is a dark comedy but is as much so a deeply dramatic story, involving the mainly secular Jews of Berlin. Included is interaction between Breitbart, an attractive stage musician Marta, their boss Hanussen, who abuses her, and some very top level Nazis. Ultimately Breitbart becomes disgusted and dismayed. A visit from Breitbart's young brother, Benjamin (Jacob Benjamin Wein), convinces Breitbart to be proud of his Jewish heritage, and so, without warning, he takes off the blonde wig in the middle of his act to announce that he is not an \\"Aryan\\", and calls himself a new Jewish Samson. This has the effect of making him a hero to the local Jews, who flock to the cabaret to see their new Samson. The Nazis aren't as pleased, and Hanussen tries to discredit Breitbart. He tries to make it seem that it was his mystic powers that were the true strength behind the strongman, and makes it look as though even his frail female pianist Marta can break chains and lift weights if under his power. Hanussen knows the Nazis dabble in the occult and hopes to become a part of Hitler's future government. He therefore hobnobs with the likes of Himmler and Goebbels. In the end, however, he is exposed as a Czech Jewish con artist named Herschel Steinschneider. As a result, Hanussen is kidnapped and murdered by the Brownshirts. Breitbart foresees what will be known as the Holocaust and returns to Poland to warn the Jewish people... Answer:","completion":"No answer"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer this question: What is the name for the ‘wavy line’ above the letter n in words such as jalapeño and piñata?","completion":"The 'wavy line' above the letter 'n' in words such as jalapeño and piñata is called a \\"tilde.\\" In the context of these specific words, it is also specifically referred to as the \\"virgulilla\\" or the \\"tilde de la eñe\\" in the Spanish language. The tilde is a diacritical mark used in various languages to provide additional information about the pronunciation and meaning of a written word. In the case of the Spanish language, the tilde above the letter 'n' transforms it into the distinct letter 'ñ,' which represents the palatal nasal sound (a sound produced with the middle part of the tongue against the hard palate) that is phonetically different from the regular 'n' sound. This sound is similar to the 'ny' sound in the English word \\"canyon.\\" The use of the tilde in Spanish can be traced back to medieval scribes who used it for abbreviating words. The letter 'ñ' originated as a ligature of two 'n's written together, with the tilde as a graphic representation of the second 'n.' Over time, the ligature and the tilde evolved into the distinct letter 'ñ' that we recognize today. Besides the Spanish language, the letter 'ñ' or other letters with a tilde are used in several other languages, such as Filipino, Galician, and Basque, among others. The role and pronunciation of the tilde in these languages may vary, but the general concept remains the same: It signifies a phonetic difference that sets the letter apart from its base form. In conclusion, the 'wavy line' above the letter 'n' in words like jalapeño and piñata is called a tilde. The presence of the tilde changes the letter from 'n' to a distinct letter called 'ñ,' which has a different phonetic sound that is crucial to the correct pronunciation and meaning of certain words in the Spanish language and other languages that use this diacritical mark."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

On February 27 2014, two other children living at the address - a nine-year-old and an 11-year-old - suffered burns and smoke inhalation when part of the house was set ablaze as they slept. Each alleged crime occurred on the 27th of the month, prompting police to investigate the 'coincidence'. Police investigating the two deaths and the fire are treating a grandmother as a person of interest in what they describe as a 'mindboggling' series of crimes at Morayfield, north of Brisbane.

Today, he was calling for justice for his boy, as well his son's half-brother and the two other boys. 'I just want to know what happened to my son,' he said. 'He was my little buddy.' On Saturday, the man changed his Facebook profile to feature a picture of his son below the words: 'Justice for (the boy's name)'. He had also written the message: 'Justice for all 4. 3 other boys went though hell to so please dont forget about them'. A relative of the man had posted: 'RIP my little pumpernickel I knew it would all come out in the end. Luvs ya and miss ya heaps (boy's name) xxxxx I'm so sorry I wasn't there to protect you.' Another user posted: 'How could someone be so evil? Such a innocent little boy' The father of the three-year-old, who had separated from the boy's mother and was not living with his son when he died, has pleaded for anyone with information to come forward and help police. '(My son) was a really healthy little boy,' he said. 'When I got the call that night he was at the hospital, something didn’t add up - he was a healthy three-year-old boy. ‘How did my little buddy die?’ Detectives have described a grandmother as being a person of interest in the investigation into the deaths of the two boys and the alleged attempted killing of the other two children as they slept in their beds. The alleged crimes all occurred at the same home in Morayfield and the grandmother was present during each incident. No one has been charged. The deaths of the three-year-old and the seven-month old were initially treated as SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome) cases, police said.

The children survived but based on a forensic recreation of the arson attack, detectives believe someone had deliberately blocked their escape pathway from the bedroom. Detective Acting Superintendent Damien Hansen said the crimes were horrific. 'To have it happen to defenceless children is just mindboggling,' he told reporters on Friday evening. Supt Hansen would not identify any family members. Both children and other occupants of the burning house were treated for smoke inhalation. 'The children were inside the room and could not exit the room,' he said. One child suffered burns to his lower limbs and was treated at Caboolture Hospital. Queensland Police have provided vision of a recreation of the case, above, featuring police staff and an unknown woman. 'Just mindboggling': Detective Acting Superintendent Damien Hansen said the crimes were horrific. Firefighters: The incidents all occurred at the one address in Morayfield.

TheghettoesofRussiaandPolandwereanessentialandintegralpartoftheTalmudicorganizationandanyattempttoabolishthemwouldhavebeendenouncedaspersecution. Please segment the words:","completion":"The ghettos of Russia and Poland were an essential and integral part of the Talmudic organization, and any attempt to abolish them would have been denounced as persecution. Now, I will provide a detailed analysis of the statement above. Ghettos were originally found in various regions throughout Europe, including Russia and Poland, where they played a significant role in Jewish and general European history. Ghettos were confined urban areas designated to the Jewish community to live in, often enclosed by walls or fences and under strict social, economic, and religious limitations. The Talmudic organization refers to the Jewish religious community that adhered to the teachings of the Talmud, an ancient set of texts that is central to the study and practice of Jewish law. The Talmud contains a collection of interpretations, commentaries, and discussions based on scriptures from the Hebrew Bible, mainly the Torah and Mishnah. It holds a profound influence on Jewish thought, legal interpretation, and cultural norms, even today. During the time when ghettos were prevalent in Russia and Poland, the Jewish population was deeply rooted in the Talmudic organization, which shaped their everyday lives and practices. The ghettos not only confined the Jewish people to a specific area within the city due to social segregation but also played a unique role in the consolidation and continuity of Jewish religious, cultural, and educational life. The ghettos provided a space for Jewish communities to maintain their religious practices, customs, and traditions, preserving their heritage in an often hostile environment. The Jewish scholars found in the ghettos were responsible for leading the study and education of the Talmud and other religious texts; as a result, they helped maintain the strength and survival of Jewish religious life. Despite the harsh living conditions and restrictions in the ghettos, any attempts to abolish or dismantle them were seen as a direct threat to Jewish religious and community life. Such an action would be considered persecution because it would cause the dismantling of communities and the subsequent scattering of Jewish people, leading to loss of cohesion and continuity in the Talmudic organization. Furthermore, the forced assimilation of the Jewish population into the non-Jewish-dominated society would challenge their unique religious and cultural identity, potentially eroding the basis of Jewish community life. Therefore, Jewish individuals and communities would actively resist the abolishment of ghettos as an attempt to disrupt their way of life. In summation, the ghettospace and structure provided Jewish communities in Russia and Poland with a means to maintain their unique religious, cultural, and educational practices rooted in Talmudic teachings, despite the many limitations and hardships. The abolishment of ghettos was perceived as a direct threat and persecution, as it would disrupt the Jewish community's cohesiveness and challenge their adherence to Talmudic values and traditions, thus risking their cultural identity."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

After the kids closed out the song, they shouted the obligatory, \\"Live from New York, it's Saturday night!\\" But it was far from the only tribute out there last night and this morning: The New York Times ran a simple list of the victims' names as its main front-page art this morning. Here's an image. As the Rolling Stones rocked out with Bruce Springsteen and Lady Gaga on the final show of their 50th anniversary tour, Mick Jagger paid tribute to Newtown's loss, reports the AP: \\"We just wanted to send our love and condolences to all the people who lost loved ones in the tragedy in Connecticut,\\" he said, adding that the world shared America's shock. Fox is yanking new episodes of Family Guy and American Dad tonight to avoid airing content that might be sensitive in the wake of the shootings, notes Huffington Post. And Pope Benedict XVI touched on the tragedy in this morning's mass in St. Peter's Square, notes Reuters. \\"I was deeply saddened by Friday's senseless violence in Newtown, Connecticut.

Various other entities paid their respects to the Newtown community following the tragedy. The New York Times displayed a list of the victims' names as the main feature on its front-page image, giving readers a somber reminder of the lives lost. Additionally, the Rolling Stones, who performed with Bruce Springsteen and Lady Gaga in the last concert of their 50th-anniversary tour, expressed their condolences to the victims' families. Mick Jagger, the band's lead singer, said, \\"We just wanted to send our love and condolences to all the people who lost loved ones in the tragedy in Connecticut.\\" Jagger also added that the entire world shared in America's shock and grief. In an effort to show sensitivity and respect for the victims, Fox decided to postpone airing new episodes of Family Guy and American Dad. This decision was made to prevent the release of content that could potentially evoke negative emotions in people affected by the school shooting. Pope Benedict XVI addressed the tragedy during a morning mass in St. Peter's Square, offering his condolences and prayers to the victims' families. He expressed his deep sadness over the senseless violence in Newtown and prayed that the God of consolation would help ease the pain of those mourning the loss of their loved ones.

Here are possible answers to this question: - garage - white house - synagogue - hospital - demonstration I believe the correct choice is \\"garage\\", here's why: The answer is:","completion":"\\"Garage\\" To understand why \\"garage\\" is the most suitable answer to this question, let's take a closer look at each of the possible options and analyze the context in which a person surrounded by tools and oil cans would be found. 1. Garage: A garage is typically a space where vehicles are stored, maintained, and repaired. It is a common setting for individuals to be surrounded by various tools and oil cans, which are used for automotive repair and maintenance tasks. People who work in a garage, such as mechanics or car enthusiasts, regularly use tools like wrenches, screwdrivers, and jacks, as well as oil cans for tasks like changing engine oil and lubricating parts. Hence, a person being surrounded by these items would most likely be found in a garage. 2. White House: The White House is the official residence and workplace of the President of the United States. While there may be maintenance personnel who use tools and oil cans in the course of their duties, such as repairing vehicles in the Presidential fleet, it would be unusual to find someone surrounded by these items inside the main building. Furthermore, these maintenance tasks would be carried out in a designated garage or workshop area, not in the White House itself. Thus, this option isn't an appropriate fit. 3. Synagogue: A synagogue is a place of worship for people who practice Judaism. It is primarily a space for prayer, spiritual guidance, and community gathering. Tools and oil cans aren't typically found or used in a synagogue, as it is not a typical environment for vehicle maintenance or repair. As a result, it would be unlikely to find a person surrounded by these items in a synagogue. 4. Hospital: A hospital is a place where people receive medical care, treatment, and diagnosis. While hospitals do have various tools for medical purposes, tools and oil cans related to vehicle maintenance are not commonly found in hospital settings. Such items wouldn't be relevant to the primary functions and responsibilities of healthcare workers. Thus, a person surrounded by tools and oil cans would not generally be found in a hospital. 5. Demonstration: A demonstration refers to a public gathering of people to protest or advocate for specific causes. Typically, demonstrations take place in outdoor settings or public spaces and focus on political or social issues, not activities such as vehicle repair or maintenance. It is highly improbable that someone surrounded by tools and oil cans would be found participating in a demonstration. In conclusion, taking into account the contexts in which each of the given options is associated with, the correct choice is \\"garage.\\" A garage is the most suitable environment for a person to be surrounded by tools and oil cans, as it is a space specifically designated for storing, maintaining, and repairing vehicles. None of the other options presents a logical connection to someone being surrounded by these particular items."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Premise: \\"Tuppence read it over her shoulder.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"Tuppence looked over her right shoulder to read it. \\"?","completion":"The given premise states: \\"Tuppence read it over her shoulder.\\" This statement gives us some information about Tuppence and her actions - she is reading something and she is doing so over her shoulder. Importantly, this statement doesn't specify which shoulder - left or right - Tuppence looked over. Given this premise, we try to assess the entailing hypothesis: \\"Tuppence looked over her right shoulder to read it.\\" Entailment in its core linguistic and logical sense means that whenever the truth of a statement (premise) guarantees the truth of another (hypothesis), the latter is entailed by the former. In this case, the premise does not provide enough specific information to guarantee the truth of the hypothesis. The hypothesis details that Tuppence used her right shoulder to read, and such a detail isn't available in the premise. Her reading over her shoulder could refer equally to her left or her right shoulder. Therefore, we cannot confidently say that from the given premise - \\"Tuppence read it over her shoulder.\\"- it directly entails the specific hypothesis \\"Tuppence looked over her right shoulder to read it.\\" The given hypothesis heavily banks on the assumption that Tuppence was looking over her right shoulder. However, assumptions are not enough to confirm the logical entailment of a hypothesis; we need the premise to state factual information that directly aligns with or equals the hypothesis. In conclusion, the premise \\"Tuppence read it over her shoulder.\\" does not entail the hypothesis \\"Tuppence looked over her right shoulder to read it.\\" due to a lack of specificity about which shoulder it was in the premise. This would be an invalid inference, as the premise doesn't provide enough specific information to confirm the hypothesis. For the entailment to hold true, the premise should be redefined with additional information - for instance, \\"Tuppence read it over her right shoulder\\" - that matches and confirms the conditions of the hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis mentioned in the question implies that a person is trying to use up all the food they have, which may result in less batter being mixed until smooth. This supposed perturbation can have both direct and indirect effects on the pancake-making process, as outlined below: Direct Effects: 1. Change in Pancake Consistency: Since there would be less batter mixed until smooth, this could result in uneven distribution of ingredients. The pancakes may have a different consistency as compared to a batter mixed until smooth, possibly making them denser or heavier. 2. Uneven Cooking: A batter that is not mixed until smooth may cause the pancakes to cook unevenly on the griddle or frying pan. Some parts of the pancake may be overcooked, while other parts could remain undercooked or raw. Indirect Effects: 1. Variation in Batch Sizes: If a person is trying to use up all the food, they might alter the measurements of the original recipe or make multiple batches to ensure they use up all the ingredients. This could lead to irregular-sized pancakes in different batches, affecting the overall cooking process. 2. Ingredient Substitution: To use up items, a person might substitute some ingredients, like using skim milk instead of whole milk or using melted margarine instead of butter. Such substitutions can change the texture of the pancakes and affect the taste or cooking process. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis of using up all available food and possibly having less batter mixed until smooth can directly impact the pancake-making process by causing changes to the consistency and cooking of the pancakes.

A native of Wausau, Wisconsin, Hirsch played college football as a halfback at the University of Wisconsin and the University of Michigan, helping to lead both the 1942 Badgers and the 1943 Wolverines to No. 3 rankings in the final AP Polls. In January 1945, the Cleveland Rams selected Hirsch in the first round (fifth overall pick) of the 1945 NFL Draft. In May, he announced that he would not sign a contract with the Rams, stating that he intended to return to the University of Wisconsin after his discharge from the military. He ultimately opted not to play in the NFL, instead playing for the Chicago Rockets of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC). Hirsch chose the Rockets because they were coached by Dick Hanley, who had been Hirsch's coach with the El Toro Marines team. Hirsch played three seasons with the Rockets from 1946 to 1948. During those three years, the Rockets compiled a 7-32 record and won only one game in each of the 1947 and 1948 seasons. Hirsch later said the decision to sign with the Rockets was the worst decision he ever made. In a remarkable display of versatility, Hirsch appeared in all 14 games for the Rockets in 1946, contributing 1,445 yards: 384 kickoff return yards and one touchdown; 347 receiving yards and three receiving touchdowns; 235 punt return yards and one touchdown; 226 rushing yards and one rushing touchdown; 156 passing yards and one passing touchdown; and 97 return yards on six interceptions. In September 1947, Hirsch caught a 76-yard touchdown pass for an AAFC record. However, injuries limited Hirsch to five games in 1947. He was described in December 1947 as probably \\"the highest paid waterboy in pro football.\\" In the fifth game of the 1948 season, Hirsch sustained a fracture on the right side of his skull after being kicked in the head during a game against the Cleveland Browns. Hirsch did not return to action during the 1948 season, totaling 101 receiving yards and 93 rushing yards in five games.","completion":"This text is about Elroy Leon \\"Crazylegs\\" Hirsch, who was an American football player, sport executive, and actor.

Q: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: My first memory of cooking was with my grandmother, Rosemary, in Sydney. She taught me how to make scrambled eggs on her electric stovetop, the kind with the coiled heating elements, in her small, linoleum-lined kitchen with cupboards that stuck a little when they closed. She was not an exceptional cook — I can remember plenty of bland and overcooked vegetables and custard made with powder to pour into pre-bought pie cases with tinned pineapple, her specialty — but she worked hard to put a balanced, home-cooked meal on the table three times a day, every day. The eldest of eight children, she dropped out of school during the Depression to help her single mother look after her siblings and work as a seamstress at David Jones. When the Second World War broke out and she was engaged to my grandfather, Aubrey, she started working on war-torn planes (“sometimes looking as if a steam roller has gone over them,” she said) as a sheet metal worker, putting them back together, when many of the men who used to do this work were off fighting the war. She said it was just like dressmaking, only using different materials. She had a twinkle in her eye and a distinct laugh that can really only be described as a cackle. She was a strong, incredibly smart woman with a fighter spirit who led her female co-workers out on the airport tarmac one day on a strike to earn equal wages to men. I am so proud that her story is taught as part of the Australian primary school curriculum. Her dream was to have a home with that electric stove. In 1943 when she was 28 she was interviewed for Australian Women’s Weekly magazine for an article on women in men’s jobs during the war, where there is a photo of her that is etched in my memory, dressed in white, wearing a white bandana tied in a knot at the top of her dark curls, a plane behind her.

Question: I have a new situation: Leaf farm and Plum farm provided the neighboring counties with quality produce year-round. plum farm used conventional farming methods such as fertilizer and pesticides, while Leaf farm used alternative eco-friendly methods only. But I can use this background: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. The nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water bodies. Since there is a lot of nitrogen it causes algae to grow out of control. Figure below shows a pond covered with algae. Algae may use up so much oxygen in the water that nothing else can grow. Soon, even the algae die out. Decomposers break down the dead tissue and use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico. You can see it Figure below . What is an answer for this question: Which farm caused more fertilizer to reach the ponds? Answer:","completion":"Based on the given information, Plum farm, which used conventional farming methods such as fertilizer and pesticides, likely caused more fertilizer to reach the ponds. This is because Rain dissolves the fertilizer used in Plum farm's conventional farming methods, allowing runoff to carry it away into bodies of water like ponds, eventually leading to the growth of algae and the creation of dead zones. Leaf farm, on the other hand, used alternative eco-friendly methods that do not involve the use of chemical fertilizers, thus minimizing the risk of contributing to the problem."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

In this math problem, \\"i\\" is what we're trying to find. It's like a secret treasure that we need to discover. To do that, we have to move the pieces of the puzzle around and put them in the right spots. So, the problem gives us: 282*i + 68*i = -573*i - 86762 Now, we're going to combine the \\"i\\" terms on the left side, like putting two bags of the same fruits together: (282 + 68)*i = 350*i That means the problem now looks like: 350*i = -573*i - 86762 Now, we want to put all the \\"i\\" terms on one side of the equal sign. To do that, we'll add 573*i to both sides: (350 + 573)*i = 923*i So now we have: 923*i = -86762 The next step is to find the treasure (the value of \\"i\\"). To do that, we need to make \\"i\\" all by itself on one side of the equal sign. We'll divide both sides by 923: i = -86762 / 923 When we do the division, we find that: i = -94 So, the secret treasure (the value of \\"i\\") is -94, and that's the solution to the math problem!

Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? Jaimey struggled in life","completion":"Yes, the following sentence does follow given the preceding text: Jaimey struggled in life. The preceding text provides context for Jaimey's struggles and hardships due to the social isolation she faced in high school as a result of the false rumor spread about her. This exclusion was caused by her peers' belief that she had a disease, which was a fabrication created by her so-called friends. Consequently, not a single boy in high school showed any interest in her or even made eye contact. Living in this kind of social isolation, Jaimey experienced a significant lack of meaningful connections and relationships with her peers, which likely had a significant negative impact on her overall well-being, self-esteem, and emotional state. Navigating her high school years without the support and connection that are generally considered essential during this time of adolescence would have presented Jaimey with considerable challenges and difficulties. The fact that she decided to confront a group of boys and ask why they were treating her this way shows her resilience and determination to overcome these challenges. However, the discovery that her friends were the ones who started the rumor would understandably be another blow to her already weakened confidence and emotional state, potentially exacerbating her struggles in life. In summary, the sentence \\"Jaimey struggled in life\\" accurately follows the given context as it highlights the various challenges and obstacles she faced due to the false rumor and the subsequent social isolation that resulted from her friends' betrayal. This sentence effectively captures the overall theme of Jaimey's hardships and difficulties in life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Write an article with the title: \\"12 states sue EPA over agency's alleged 'sue and settle' tactics\\"","completion":"Title: 12 States Sue EPA Over Agency's Alleged 'Sue and Settle' Tactics Introduction: In a recent turn of events, 12 US states have united to file a lawsuit against the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), accusing them of engaging in alleged 'sue and settle' tactics. The lawsuit emphasizes the concerns of these states about the potentially negative consequences of the EPA's seemingly opaque and non-transparent approach to policy-making and enforcement. (Step 1: Introduce the main topic and context of the article.) Background on 'Sue and Settle': The term 'sue and settle' refers to a controversial legal strategy in which an agency adopts regulations and enforces policies in response to lawsuits initiated by outside groups, often without giving affected stakeholders the opportunity to participate in the decision-making process. Critics argue that this tactic enables agencies like the EPA to operate behind closed doors, following agendas defined by external parties rather than public interest. (Step 2: Explain the concept of 'sue and settle', its implications, and why it's controversial.) The States Involved: The states taking part in the lawsuit against the EPA are predominantly located in the South and Midwest regions of the United States. They include Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, and West Virginia. The Attorney General of each state has expressed dissatisfaction with the EPA's alleged use of 'sue and settle' tactics for bypassing the required procedures and undermining state sovereignty. (Step 3: List the states involved in the lawsuit and briefly outline their concerns.) The Allegations: According to the lawsuit, the EPA's alleged 'sue and settle' tactics have been primarily utilized in the development and enforcement of the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and other essential environmental regulations. The states claim that the EPA has settled lawsuits initiated by environmental advocacy groups, resulting in tighter regulations and heightened enforcement of existing rules without providing proper transparency or engaging in requisite public participation processes. Furthermore, the states are concerned that these tactics may erode their ability to respond to local environmental issues and prioritize resources effectively. (Step 4: Detail the specific allegations against the EPA and the potential consequences of their actions.) Response from the EPA: In response to the lawsuit, the EPA has denied any wrongdoing and has insisted that they remain committed to involving stakeholders in their decision-making processes. The agency argues that their actions in settling lawsuits are rooted in a desire to conserve resources and avoid long-drawn litigation, rather than bypassing public participation or state sovereignty. (Step 5: Present the EPA's response and perspective on the allegations.) Potential Impacts and Next Steps: If the states succeed in their lawsuit against the EPA, it could have wide-ranging implications for the way the agency operates moving forward. The EPA may be forced to reevaluate its approach to lawsuits, ensuring greater transparency and collaboration with affected parties. It remains to be seen how the lawsuit will unfold and what impact it will have on the future of environmental regulation and enforcement in the United States. (Step 6: Discuss the possible outcomes of the lawsuit and the potential impacts on the EPA and environmental regulations.) Conclusion: The lawsuit filed by the 12 states against the EPA is a significant development in the ongoing debate surrounding the use of 'sue and settle' tactics in environmental regulation and policy-making. As the case progresses, it will be crucial to pay close attention to the arguments presented by both sides and the potential consequences it might have on the EPA's overall approach to ensuring environmental protection, while maintaining transparency and upholding state sovereignty. (Step 7: Summarize the overall significance of the lawsuit and its implications for environmental regulation and policy-making.)"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

To find the longest substring that is a palindrome, we need to look for a sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward. For the given string lfflllflff, let's analyze it: 1.

However, there is an even longer palindrome in this string, which is 'lll' (reading the same forward and backward). 5. No other substring longer than 'lll' forms a palindrome in the given string. Based on this analysis, the longest palindrome substring in the string lfflllflff is 'lll'.

Sentence 1: as in metric size hole or a or an American sized hole Sentence 2: It's probably a metric hole, but I thin you might be referring to an American hole? If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"To determine if the second sentence is true when the first sentence is true, let's analyze both sentences step-by-step: 1. Understand each sentence: - Sentence 1: as in metric size hole or a or an American sized hole - This sentence is referring to a hole that can either have a metric size measurement, or an American size measurement. - Sentence 2: It's probably a metric hole, but I thin you might be referring to an American hole? - This sentence is expressing that the hole is likely to be a metric-sized hole, but the speaker is uncertain and thinks it might also be possible that the listener is referring to an American-sized hole. There's also a typo in the sentence (thin should be think). 2. Compare the content and logic of these two sentences: - Sentence 1 is considering two possibilities, while sentence 2 is suggesting one possibility with greater probability (metric) and questioning the other possibility (American). 3. Evaluate if the second sentence is true when the first sentence is true: - If the first sentence is true, it means that there are two possible sizes for the hole - metric and American. In the second sentence, it is also considering both metric and American hole sizes, but with a specific probability express about them (probably metric). So, we can say that the second sentence is mostly in line with the first sentence in terms of considering both possible sizes. However, the second sentence contains a typo (thin -> think) and expresses a probability relationship that is not explicitly mentioned in the first sentence.

City sees overhaul as precursor to sale, leaving group focused on &lt;b&gt;...&lt;/b&gt; P amp;O staked its immediate future as a ferry operator on the burgeoning freight market yesterday as it blamed the death of the booze cruise for the need to axe one-fifth of its workforce. What is this text about?","completion":"This text is about a major reorganization and potential sale of the city's ferry operating company, P&O. The company has experienced significant challenges, particularly the decline of the \\"booze cruise\\" segment, which has led to a refocusing on the freight market and the need to cut their workforce by 20%. P&O, a ferry operator, had previously relied on the popularity of \\"booze cruises\\" - leisure trips in which passengers enjoy duty-free alcohol purchases and socializing aboard the cruise. However, the decline in these operations' profitability forced P&O to seek alternative revenue sources. As a result, the company decided to concentrate on the freight market for growth. The shift in focus was seen as a necessary move for P&O's survival in an increasingly competitive market. However, this strategic change had consequences on the company's employees, with one-fifth of them being laid off. This significant reduction in workforce likely had an impact on the morale and job security of the remaining employees. The text also suggests that this overhaul might be a precursor to the potential sale of the city's ferry operation, with P&O divesting this segment of its business. In doing so, the company would aim to become a more streamlined and focused enterprise, primarily dealing with the more lucrative freight segment. By specializing in freight, P&O expected to become more competitive and profitable, increasing its chances of attracting a buyer in case the company were to be sold. Ultimately, the text highlights the challenges faced by the city's ferry operator, P&O, as it navigates a changing market landscape. It sheds light on the decline of the popular \\"booze cruise\\" industry and its impact on the company's direction and workforce. Moreover, it brings attention to the potential sale and overhaul of P&O, as the company aims to find new success and relevance in the growing freight market."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The phenomenon of biochemical processes' serving to regulate distant tissues by means of secretions directly into the circulatory system is called endocrine signaling. The major endocrine glands include the pineal gland, pituitary gland, pancreas, ovaries, testes, thyroid gland, parathyroid gland, and adrenal glands. The endocrine system is in contrast to the exocrine system, which secretes its hormones to the outside of the body using ducts. The endocrine system is an information signal system like the nervous system, yet its effects and mechanism are classifiably different. The endocrine system's effects are slow to initiate, and prolonged in their response, lasting from a few hours up to weeks. The nervous system sends information very quickly, and responses are generally short lived. In vertebrates, the hypothalamus is the neural control center for all endocrine systems. The field of study dealing with the endocrine system and its disorders is endocrinology, a branch of internal medicine. Special features of endocrine glands are, in general, their ductless nature, their vascularity, and commonly the presence of intracellular vacuoles or granules that store their hormones. In contrast, exocrine glands, such as salivary glands, sweat glands, and glands within the gastrointestinal tract, tend to be much less vascular and have ducts or a hollow lumen. - A hormone (from the Greek participle ) is any member of a class of signaling molecules produced by glands in multicellular organisms that are transported by the circulatory system to target distant organs to regulate physiology and behaviour. Hormones have diverse chemical structures, mainly of 3 classes: eicosanoids, steroids, and amino acid derivatives (amines, peptides, and proteins). The glands that secrete hormones comprise the endocrine signaling system. The term hormone is sometimes extended to include chemicals produced by cells that affect the same cell (autocrine or intracrine signalling) or nearby cells (paracrine signalling). - An anesthesiologist (American English) or anaesthetist (British English) is a physician trained in anesthesia and perioperative medicine. - The pancreas is a glandular organ in the digestive system and endocrine system of vertebrates. In humans, it is located in the abdominal cavity behind the stomach. It is an endocrine gland producing several important hormones, including insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, and pancreatic polypeptide which circulate in the blood. The pancreas is also a digestive organ, secreting pancreatic juice containing digestive enzymes that assist digestion and absorption of nutrients in the small intestine. These enzymes help to further break down the carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids in the chyme. The pancreas is also known as mixed gland. - The stomach is a muscular, hollow, dilated part of the gastrointestinal tract that functions as an important organ in the digestive system. The stomach is present in many animals including vertebrates, echinoderms, insects (mid-gut), and molluscs. In humans and many other vertebrates it is involved in the second phase of digestion, following mastication (chewing). - Liver transplantation or hepatic transplantation is the replacement of a diseased liver with some or all of a healthy liver from another person (allograft). The most commonly used technique is phototropic transplantation, in which the native liver is removed and replaced by the donor organ in the same anatomic location as the original liver. Liver transplantation is a viable treatment option for end-stage liver disease and acute liver failure. Typically three surgeons and two anesthesiologists are involved, with up to four supporting nurses. The surgical procedure is very demanding and ranges from 4 to 18 hours depending on outcome. Numerous anastomoses and sutures, and many disconnections and reconnections of abdominal and liver tissue, must be made for the transplant to succeed, requiring an eligible recipient and a well-calibrated live or cadaveric donor match. - A cadaver, also called corpse (singular) in medical, literary, and legal usage, or when intended for dissection, is a deceased body. The obsolete British term \\"lich\\" for \\"corpse\\", sometimes spelled \\"lych\\", is no longer even listed in major British dictionaries such as Longman, Macmillan, Cambridge, or Oxford Online Dictionaries. However, the term \\"lich\\" has been revived in modern fantasy fiction for a type of \\"undead\\" creature. - Echinoderm is the common name given to any member of the phylum Echinodermata (from Ancient Greek, , \\"echinos\\" \\"hedgehog\\" and , \\"derma\\" \\"skin\\") of marine animals. The adults are recognizable by their (usually five-point) radial symmetry, and include such well-known animals as sea stars, sea urchins, sand dollars, and sea cucumbers, as well as the sea lilies or \\"stone lilies\\". Echinoderms are found at every ocean depth, from the intertidal zone to the abyssal zone. The phylum contains about 7000 living species, making it the second-largest grouping of deuterostomes (a superphylum), after the chordates (which include the vertebrates, such as birds, fishes, mammals, and reptiles). Echinoderms are also the largest phylum that has no freshwater or terrestrial (land-based) representatives. - Pancreatic juice is a liquid secreted by the pancreas, which contains a variety of enzymes, including trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, elastase, carboxypeptidase, pancreatic lipase, nucleases and amylase. The pancreas is located in the visceral region, and is a major part of the digestive system required for proper digestion and subsequent assimilation of macronutrient substances required for living. - Endocrine glands are glands of the endocrine system that secrete their products, \\"hormones\\", directly into the blood rather than through a duct. The major glands of the endocrine system include the pineal gland, pituitary gland, pancreas, ovaries, testes, thyroid gland, parathyroid gland, hypothalamus and adrenal glands. The hypothalamus and pituitary gland are neuroendocrine organs. Local chemical messengers, not generally considered part of the endocrine system, include autocrines, which act on the cells that secrete them, and paracrines, which act on a different cell type nearby.

Next question: who has won the icc world cup of 2011?","completion":"The 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup was won by the Indian national cricket team. The tournament took place from February 19th to April 2nd, 2011, and was co-hosted by India, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh. This was the 10th edition of the ICC Cricket World Cup and featured 14 participating teams. India emerged as the ultimate victors in a thrilling final match held at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, India. They faced Sri Lanka, who were also vying for the prestigious title. The Sri Lankan team batted first and posted a target score of 274 runs for the loss of six wickets. Their innings was anchored by a magnificent unbeaten 103 off 88 balls by veteran cricketer Mahela Jayawardene. Chasing a daunting target of 275 to claim the trophy, India lost their explosive opening batsman Virender Sehwag for a duck and then their batting powerhouse Sachin Tendulkar with only 31 runs on the board. However, India's middle-order batsmen demonstrated their resilience, with Gautam Gambhir scoring a crucial 97 runs and captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni coming in at a crucial juncture to take control of the situation. With the match hanging in the balance, Dhoni played a captain's innings and remained unbeaten on 91 runs, including the iconic six he hit to seal the victory. India won the match by six wickets and with ten balls to spare, ending a 28-year wait for the nation since their first World Cup triumph back in 1983. The 2011 Indian World Cup squad included the following players: 1. Mahendra Singh Dhoni (Captain, Wicketkeeper) 2. Virender Sehwag (Vice-Captain, Opening batsman) 3. Sachin Tendulkar (Batsman) 4. Gautam Gambhir (Batsman) 5. Virat Kohli (Batsman) 6. Suresh Raina (All-rounder) 7. Yuvraj Singh (All-rounder) 8. Harbhajan Singh (Spinner) 9. Zaheer Khan (Seam bowler) 10.

Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines that it provides. You solve the task and show how you used the guidelines to solve the task. Detailed Instructions: In mathematics, the absolute value of a number is the non-negative value of that number, without regarding its sign. For example, the absolute value of -2 is 2, and the absolute value of 5 is 5. In this task you will be given a list of numbers and you need to return the element with highest absolute value. If a negative and positive element have the same absolute value you should return the positive element. The absolute value for negative numbers can be found by multiplying them by -1. After finding the element with the maximum absolute value you should return the value of that element before you applied the absolute value. Problem:[ 8.78 56.867 -17.482 66.064 -12.982 -18.21 88.584 19.085 30.01 -7.61 ] Solution:","completion":"The task requires finding the element with the maximum absolute value from a list of numbers. According to the guidelines, if two numbers have the same absolute value, one being positive and the other negative, the positive one should be selected. After the element with the maximum absolute value is determined, the actual value of this element (including its original sign) must be returned. There are three main steps to this task: 1. Apply the absolute value to every element in the list. This can be done by changing the sign of the number to positive if it's negative. The absolute value for negative numbers can be found by multiplying them by -1. 2. Find the element with the maximum absolute value. This involves comparing each number's absolute value and retaining the one that is greatest. 3. Return the original value of the number identified in step 2 (with its original sign). Now let's apply these steps to the provided list of numbers: [8.78, 56.867, -17.482, 66.064, -12.982, -18.21, 88.584, 19.085, 30.01, -7.61] 1.

Question: What does Calvin plot to steal? Title: Little Man Movie plot: This article needs an improved plot summary. (October 2015) Calvin \\"Babyface\\" Simms (Marlon Wayans) is a very short convict. With the help of his goofball cohort Percy (Tracy Morgan), Calvin plots a jewellery shop robbery to steal one of the world's largest diamonds. After the successful robbery, the duo are almost arrested, but not before Calvin manages to stash the diamond in a nearby woman's purse. The thieves follow the handbag's owner to her home where they discover a couple, Darryl (Shawn Wayans) and Vanessa Edwards (Kerry Washington), who are eager to have a child. Calvin and Percy hatch a plot to pass Calvin off as a baby left on the couple's doorstep. Darryl and Vanessa, wanting a child, immediately adopt the baby as their own. However, Vanessa's dad Francis \\"Pops\\" (John Witherspoon) has a bad feeling about Calvin. Friends of the couple find Calvin odd as well. A local goon named Walken (Chazz Palminteri), discovers the deception and demands the diamond from Percy. Percy sells out Darryl and now Calvin, in a series of comedic maneuvers, manages to rescue Darryl and have Walken arrested. Darryl is given a substantial reward for the recovery of the diamond, and since Calvin saved his life, he doesn't turn him over to the police. Before he leaves, Calvin thanks Darryl for taking care of him even though he wasn't really a baby and admits that he thinks Darryl would make a great father for a real child someday. Calvin is about to be out of Darryl's life for good, as Darryl watches him leave. Calvin is crying hysterically, so Darryl decides to let Calvin stay and from that point on, the two men become the best of friends. The film ends at some point in the future with Calvin and Pops playing with Darryl and Vanessa's real baby, who looks exactly like Darryl (Shawn Wayans's face superimposed on that of the baby).","completion":"Calvin plots to steal one of the world's largest diamonds from a jewellery shop."},{"prompt":"Question: \\"The Actress the Dollars and the Transylvanians\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to?

Aaron felt guilty.; II. Randy felt guilty.;","completion":"II. Randy felt guilty. At the birthday party, Aaron had a drink spilled all over them by Randy, so Randy felt guilty. This scenario illustrates the cause and effect relationship between actions and emotions. When Randy accidentally spilled the drink on Aaron, he would likely feel responsible for the mishap, leading to feelings of guilt. In addition to feeling guilty, Randy may experience other emotions, such as embarrassment or anxiety, as he realizes his actions may have caused discomfort or annoyance to Aaron. He may also be concerned about how others at the party perceive the situation, as it might impact his social standing and relationships. On the other hand, Aaron may feel surprised or upset initially at being drenched in the drink, but guilt is unlikely to be an emotion they would experience in this scenario. It is plausible that Aaron might share some empathy for Randy, who is now feeling guilty. Aaron might try to alleviate Randy's guilt by reassuring him that accidents happen and there are no hard feelings. In conclusion, the sentence would end with \\"Randy felt guilty,\\" since Randy is the one responsible for the mishap and would experience guilt as a consequence of his actions. It emphasizes the concept of guilt being tied to responsibility and the recognition of one's error."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","completion":"In order to determine whether the hypothesis, \\"It is a changed world,\\" is entailed by the premise, \\"it was it's it's a different world,\\" we must first analyze the premise, interpret its intended meaning, and then consider whether the hypothesis follows logically from that meaning. Upon analyzing the premise \\"it was it's it's a different world,\\" it appears that there may be a few grammatical errors. It is possible that the intended meaning may be \\"it was, it is, it's a different world.\\" This interpretation suggests that the speaker is trying to emphasize that the world was different in the past, is different now, and it continues to be a different world. Now let's analyze the hypothesis that \\"it is a changed world.\\" This statement implies that the world has undergone a transformation or shift from a previous state to the current state. Both the premise and the hypothesis are discussing the world and its condition, and both imply a sense of change or difference. Considering both the interpretation of the premise and the statement of the hypothesis, there is an overlap in the idea of a world that is different or changed. The premise suggests that the world has always been different and continues to be so, while the hypothesis emphasizes the change that the world has undergone. In this context, the hypothesis can be seen as entailed by the premise, as both express the notion of a world in flux, undergoing changes, and being different from a past state. However, it should be noted that the premise contains a stronger emphasis on the constant state of difference, while the hypothesis focuses on the specific transformation from one state to another. Despite this slight difference in emphasis, the core idea of a world that is different or changed is still present in both statements, making the hypothesis a logical consequence of the premise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","completion":"Let's analyze the two sentences step by step: Sentence 1: \\"When Mustafa marched to Murad in Anatolia, Junayd was persuaded to confront him.\\" Step 1: Mustafa marched to Murad in Anatolia. Step 2: Junayd was persuaded to confront Mustafa (since \\"him\\" refers to Mustafa). Sentence 2: \\"When Mustafa marched to confront Murad in Anatolia, Junayd was persuaded to leave him.\\" Step 1: Mustafa marched to confront Murad in Anatolia. Step 2: Junayd was persuaded to leave Mustafa (since \\"him\\" refers to Mustafa). Comparing the two sentences: In both sentences, Mustafa marches in Anatolia, but their actions are different: - In Sentence 1, Mustafa marches \\"to\\" Murad, whereas in Sentence 2, Mustafa marches \\"to confront\\" Murad. This suggests a difference in intention or purpose. - In Sentence 1, Junayd is persuaded to confront Mustafa. In Sentence 2, Junayd is persuaded to leave Mustafa. These actions are opposite in nature, making the two sentences convey different meanings.

Unfortunately, e-mail messages from the ISO inadvertently spread this virus to many of your work stations. The ISO is very concerned that it not spread such viruses either within the CAISO or to the ISO's Market Participants. We sincerely regret any inconvenience this may have caused you. Several Market Participants have asked about the ISO's procedures for protecting against and responding to computer virus attacks. We would like to update you on our procedures that allow the ISO to detect a virus, isolate it quickly, implement countermeasures until the antivirus upgrade is available and clean and restore our systems (servers and PCs). The California ISO sends and receives thousands of electronic messages every day because of who we are and what we do. During the normal course of business, the majority of these messages contain attachments exchanging and providing information. One method used by malicious programs (Viruses, Worms, and Trojan-Horses) to spread is by electronic mail. It is the attachment that carries the malicious program, not the email itself. So, when a user opens an infected executable file, the malicious program is activated and initiates what it is programmed to do. Examples of executable files that may be infected include, but not limited to, Word documents (.doc), Excel spreadsheets (.xls), or Visual Basic files (.vbs). CAISO's Antivirus Program uses a three-tiered approach where scanning (detect, clean or delete) is performed on email messages with attachments at the Gateway Servers, the Mail Servers, and Users' PCs and Laptops. All incoming and outgoing email with attachments are scanned for all known viruses. That is a key element of an antivirus program. New viruses or new strains of computer viruses, worms, and Trojan-Horses are discovered at an alarming rate. Antivirus manufacturers try to keep up with the new discoveries and try to be the first to market with the updates. There are over 50,000 known active viruses circulating the Internet today.

It looks like Lindsay Lohan's jailhouse honeymoon is over. A day after inmates cheered her arrival, some prisoners are already grousing about the \\"Mean Girls\\" actress. Even though officials have insisted Lohan is treated like everyone else - beyond getting her own cell - rumors flew that the star is enjoying perks. \\"She's getting special treatment. Some inmates were getting pissy over it,\\" Debra Sickels, 30, said as she was released after doing 19 days for shoplifting. Sickels said that during her stint, she was in the infirmary every day for medical treatment, \\"and the girls said they cleaned a special room for Lindsay. It had a regular hospital bed, a TV and a dresser for her new clothes and socks.\\" Other just-sprung inmates said they heard Lohan was paying for special food and new clothes and had a female guard at her disposal and access to a private phone. \\"She's being treated like any other inmate in her classification. There's no special treatment at all,\\" said Los Angeles sheriff's spokesman Steve Whitmore. The \\"Freaky Friday\\" star was jailed Tuesday to serve a 90-day sentence for violating her probation by missing a string of alcohol education classes this year. When she arrived in handcuffs and tears, prisoners yelled out her name and shouted, \\"God bless you!\\" Lohan is expected to serve as little as two weeks because of good behavior and jail overcrowding. On LiLo's second day behind bars, defense lawyer Shawn Chapman Holley stopped by for an hour-long visit, but didn't answer questions. Later in the day, Lohan's mom, Dina, and kid sister Ali showed up. An exiting inmate said the jail was put on an hour lockdown for the visit. \\"I sat there for four hours waiting to get released because of her,\\" said Sharell Gaines, 30, a Watts resident who spent a week in jail for traffic tickets. \\"They put us on lockdown and told us not to look. It's discrimination. She's a criminal, just like me.\\" TMZ.com claimed that LiLo was given permission to take some prescription drugs while behind bars: the stimulant Adderall to treat attention deficit disorder and the sleeping pill Ambien. Like all other inmates, she can spend up to 135 a week in the commissary for munchies like Spicy Velveeta Refried Beans, Spam, Kit Kat candy bars and Country Time Raspberry Lemonade, TMZ.com said. sgoldsmith@nydailynews.com ||||| Michael Lohan is denying he kicked fiancé Kate Major in the face, RadarOnline.com is reporting.

For one thing, those pipes have got to be rusty.The star first showcased her singing on soundtracks for some of her early films, including 'Freaky Friday,' but she really came into her own with her anti-paparazzi rant 'Rumors,' off of her platinum-selling debut album, 2005's 'Speak.'Her biggest hit arrived a year later with 'Confessions of a Broken Heart,' a heart-wrencher about her dysfunctional home life, which she co-wrote with now-'American Idol' judge Kara DioGuardi. ||||| Michael Lohan’s ex-fiancée has sought a restraining order against him after the alleged brutal showdown at their Southampton home on Monday, RadarOnline.com has confirmed exclusively. Kate Major, former magazine reporter and one-time Jon Gosselin gal pal, filed for an order of protection against Lindsay Lohan’s father after she told police he shoved her and kicked her in the face during an argument. Lindsay Lohan — See The New Mug Shot The order, which was granted, prevents Lohan from contacting his one-time lover or going anywhere near her. He has not yet been served the papers relating to the order because he is in Los Angeles, attempting to visit his estranged daughter, who has said she does not want to see him. PHOTOS: Lindsay Lohan’s Family Photo Album Major confirmed to RadarOnline.com that she filed a temporary restraining order at a New York courthouse on Wednesday morning. But she did not want to elaborate on more details. PHOTOS: Lindsay Lohan Arrives At Lynwood Correctional Facility Major has claimed she has photographic evidence and hospital records supporting her version of events after the alleged brawl, although Lohan has insisted the confrontation was never physical. Facing yet more legal woes, Lohan turned on Major and threatened retribution against his ex-fiancée the only was he knows how — with audio tapes. The Lohan patriarch said he planned to release recordings detailing Major’s “legal and personal issues”. PHOTOS: Lindsay Lohan Arriving At Court On Tuesday “Because of Kate’s behavior and false claims, I am going to release a statement and only the first of many pictures of Kate (obliterated) as well as the first of multiple recordings,” Lohan told RadarOnline.com. As their romance hits the skids, sources close to Major told RadarOnline.com the couple’s wedding, expected to take place in the fall in New York, is officially over. “Kate voluntarily returned the engagement ring to Michael before he left for L.A. and there are absolutely no plans for a wedding,” said one friend. Earlier on Wednesday, Lohan declared to RadarOnline.com: “Why wouldn’t it still be on?” PHOTOS: Celebs Who Have Served Time In The Slammer In the wake of the bitter split, the pair are trading a flurry of accusations. Lohan declared Major, in a a fit of jealous rage, accused him of checking into a Los Angeles hotel with mystery woman — a claim Lohan has denied. On the other hand, Major’s camp is suggesting Lohan, a sobriety campaigner and the chief critic of Lindsay’s battles with booze and drugs, has fallen of the wagon. “He tried to hide the drinking,” said one of Major’s pals. Lohan also suggested Major had drained their bank account of all of his funds. She, too, has rejected that allegation. |||||Summary:","completion":"Lindsay Lohan, a famous actress, went to jail for breaking some rules.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Hayao Miyazaki's second feature film, and his first one to be widely acclaimed both commercially and critically (though his debut - Nausicaa AKA Warriors of the Wind is considered by many fans his best), 'Tenku no Shiro Rapyuta' AKA 'Castle in the Sky' may seem childish and simplistic when compared to his more recent masterpieces like 'Kiki's Delivery Service', 'Mononoke-hime' and 'Spirited Away', but in 1986 it was years ahead of its time and it was one of the milestones of modern anime. It's important to remember that 'Castle in the Sky' was made two years before the revolutionary 'Akira', and while it's not provocative and controversial like the aforementioned masterpiece, the lead characters are all mainly basic manga hero / heroine / villain type characters, and the story is quite predictable and obvious (at least in today's standards), Miyazaki's designs and animation work are of standards never seen before. While the story and humor are a bit silly and outdated at times, the movie is still very entertaining and very enjoyable - if not as breathtaking as 'Spirited Away'. And if you'll allow yourself to see the beauty of the frames themselves and ignore the low-budget coloring and animation and the identical twin faces - at this point Miyazaki is still faithful to his roots and to the agreed standards of Japanese cartooning - you'll see Miyazaki's genius shine through as well as it does on 'Spirited Away' and Mononoke. While 'Castle in the Sky', being a sci-fi adventure and very suitable for children, fits in more neatly with classic anime than anything else he had done since, his motifs and principles still show and play an important part. To say much more would be to ruin the movie, so I'll kindly shut up. Suffice to say that I'm giving it only nine stars because if I gave it ten I couldn't go any higher for 'Spirited Away' and 'Princess Mononoke'. And that would be a crime. As in most anime movies, I recommend watching the Japanese version with the English subtitles, even if you don't speak a word of Japanese - the English overdubs just don't tend to be very good, and in this case it's just horrendous. You might want to watch it in the English version once, though, just for the laughs, and for the star-filled cast (the English dub was only recorded following the success of 'Spirited Away', as it was for 'Kiki's Delivery Service') - Anna Paquin and James Van Der Beek (Yeah, the Dawson guy!) fill the lead roles, Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker from 'Star Wars', in case you don't know!) plays the villain, and other roles are filled by Andy Dick, Tres MacNeille (The Simpsons, Rugrats, Animaniacs...), Michael McShane (Friar Tuck from Kevin Costner's Robin Hood travesty) and Mandy Patinkin (Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya...)

Between 301 and 219 BCE the Ptolemies ruled Judea in relative peace, and Jews often found themselves working in the Ptolemaic administration and army, which led to the rise of a Hellenized Jewish elite class (e.g. the Tobiads). The wars of Antiochus III brought the region into the Seleucid empire; Jerusalem fell to his control in 198 and the Temple was repaired and provided with money and tribute. Antiochus IV Epiphanes sacked Jerusalem and looted the Temple in 169 BCE after disturbances in Judea during his abortive invasion of Egypt. Antiochus then banned key Jewish religious rites and traditions in Judea. He may have been attempting to Hellenize the region and unify his empire and the Jewish resistance to this eventually led to an escalation of violence.

An announcer is paging Captain James (Douglas Lambert) as the ship he is piloting is leaving in just a few minutes. We see James enter a locker room where he starts to put on his spacesuit and we see another figure in a spacesuit lurking in the corner wearing a helmet so we can't see his face. James addresses the figure as Benson (Harvey Keitel). Benson has apparently just failed a mental stability exam and James is replacing him on this mission. Before James is finished putting on his suit, however, Benson straps himself down and opens the airlock venting the locker room. James is killed and his body flushed out into space. Benson closes the door and then takes James's place on the mission.Benson flies the ship through the rings of Saturn and lands it on a moon at the Saturn 3 experimental food station. It is a remote and isolated underground facility crewed by just two scientists: the older Adam (played by a 64 year-old Kirk Douglas) and the beautiful young Alex (played by a 33 year-old Farrah Fawcett). Despite their age difference the two are happy as lovers.Adam and Alex escort Benson inside the facility. Despite their warm greeting, Benson seems cold. He tells them they are behind schedule on developing the new food sources that the over-populated Earth desperately needs. He has brought a new robot - HECTOR - that he will assemble and program to help speed the project. Once Hector is operational he will be so effective that one of the scientists will no longer be needed.When Alex and Benson are alone, he makes it clear that he is interested in having sex with her. She tells him she is exclusively with Adam and Benson responds that on Earth it is considered inhospitable to refuse his request. Alex, who was born in space and has never visited Earth, though she is curious about it, points out that they are not on Earth and continues to ignore his advances. He, in turn, tells her that Adam is \\"obsolete.\\"Alex escorts Benson to his... The answer is:","completion":"In the movie Saturn 3, Benson himself is the one who commits the murder. He kills Captain James at the beginning of the film by opening the airlock which causes James to be flushed out into space. Benson then proceeds to take James's place on the mission, leading him to the Saturn 3 experimental food station where he meets Adam and Alex, the two scientists working there. As the plot unfolds, it becomes clear that Benson is not mentally stable and poses a threat to both Adam and Alex. He assembles and programs a robot named HECTOR to help speed up the project, but also tells Alex that once HECTOR is operational, one of the scientists will no longer be needed, implying that he might have plans to get rid of one of them. Moreover, Benson displays unsettling behavior by making advances towards Alex despite her clear refusal. In summary, Benson is the murderer in the movie Saturn 3, having killed Captain James at the beginning of the film. His unstable behavior throughout the plot, as well as his interactions with Adam and Alex, further emphasize his dangerous nature."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Premise: \\"About one hour away from Bhopal, the stupas of Sanchi are the most admired Buddhist monuments in the whole of India.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"The stupas of Sanchi are one of the most admired Buddhist monuments.\\" true?","completion":"Based on the given premise, the hypothesis \\"The stupas of Sanchi are one of the most admired Buddhist monuments\\" is indeed true. The premise specifically mentions that the stupas of Sanchi are the most admired Buddhist monuments in the whole of India, which supports the hypothesis. To further expand on the hypothesis, it is important to understand the significance of the stupas of Sanchi and the reasons behind their admiration. The stupas of Sanchi are a group of Buddhist monuments located in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, approximately one hour away from the city of Bhopal. These monuments date back to the Mauryan Empire, which ruled India from the 4th to the 2nd century BCE. The stupas hold great historical and cultural significance, highlighting the architectural, artistic, and religious achievement of the era. The most famous stupa at Sanchi is the Great Stupa or Stupa 1. It was originally commissioned by Emperor Ashoka, a prominent Mauryan emperor, and a well-known patron of Buddhism. Over the centuries, the Great Stupa has been enlarged and embellished with various structures, including toranas (ornamental gateways), balustrades, and sculptural reliefs, which depict scenes from the life of the Buddha and the Jataka tales that describe the previous lives of the Buddha. The stupas of Sanchi are admired not only for their beautiful and intricate stone carvings but also as important symbols of the spread of Buddhism in India and other parts of Asia. The monuments exemplify the architectural achievements of the Mauryan period and display a rich amalgamation of artistic influences from across India. In addition, the stupas serve as a significant spiritual pilgrimage destination for Buddhists from around the world. Furthermore, the stupas of Sanchi have been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, further establishing their reputation as one of the most admired Buddhist monuments. This recognition is a testament to the historical, cultural, and artistic significance of these monuments, as well as their outstanding universal value. In conclusion, the hypothesis \\"The stupas of Sanchi are one of the most admired Buddhist monuments\\" is true, as demonstrated by the given premise. The stupas of Sanchi hold great historical and cultural significance and are considered to be the most admired Buddhist monuments in India. Their recognition as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and their role as spiritual pilgrimage destinations further solidify their position as highly admired and renowned monuments in the Buddhist tradition."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: LaHood Sponsored Millions in Earmarks The former Republican congressman chosen by President-elect Barack Obama to direct billions in federal highway spending has been an unapologetic advocate of earmarks, a practice Obama now opposes, and has used his influence to win funding for projects pushed by some of his largest campaign contributors. Ray LaHood, who represented Illinois in the House for seven terms, sponsored 60 million in earmarks last year, steering at least 9 million in federal money to campaign donors, a Washington Post analysis shows. An opponent of earmark reform efforts in Congress, LaHood ranks roughly among the top 10 percent in the House for sponsoring earmarks in 2008, according to a watchdog group. LaHood's record poses an important question as hearings begin today that will explore how he would administer part of a 775 billion stimulus package that will be directed to the Transportation Department. LaHood has defended his use of earmarks as a way to direct federal money to decaying communities in his district and insisted there is no connection between his earmarks and projects benefiting campaign donors. Obama has pledged to resist pressure from local interests and to block unjustified earmarks from inclusion in the stimulus bill. \\"We're not having earmarks in the recovery package, period,\\" he said Jan. 7. The stimulus package would include the largest wave of federal transportation spending since the Eisenhower administration launched the creation of the interstate highway system. Transition spokesman Dan Leistikow credited LaHood for \\"14 years of honorable and outstanding service as a congressman, fighting on behalf of his constituents and creating jobs for working families.\\" LaHood, 62, a longtime member of the House Appropriations Committee until his retirement last month, declined to comment. Government watchdog groups say LaHood's selection does not bode well for Obama's pledge to return transparency to government spending. Earmarks are often last-minute insertions in federal spending bills and are not subject to normal reviews. LaHood also has been criticized for his ties to a longtime Republican state kingmaker in Illinois, William F. Cellini Sr., who was indicted in the \\"pay-to-play\\" criminal investigation underway by the office of Northern District U.S. Attorney Patrick J. Fitzgerald. Cellini has denied wrongdoing. \\"This guy has history of pork barrel spending and lot of a questionable spending linked to his friends. He's going to be in charge of funneling hundreds of billions of dollars into local projects . . . and he's not going to be suddenly changing his stripes tomorrow,\\" said Leslie Paige of the watchdog group Citizens Against Government Waste. LaHood's biggest campaign donor is Peoria's largest corporation: Caterpillar. The company and its workers have donated more than 190,000 to LaHood since 1998, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Last year, LaHood secured 7.8 million to help the company and its offshoots develop technologies for potential future military contracts. Last year, he also pushed for 333,000 to construct the new Lakeview Museum in Peoria, part of a project that will include a Caterpillar-financed museum focused on the company's history. LaHood sponsored 1.49 million in earmarks directed to Springfield's Memorial Medical Center to fund the purchase of computer-based simulation technology and other equipment. Memorial and its lobbyist Cassidy and Associates together have given 60,000 to LaHood. Local road-building companies also have supported LaHood. United Contractors Midwest, led by president James Bruner, is often ranked as his second or third largest donor, and its officials have donated 24,925 to LaHood. Three leading members of the Illinois Asphalt Pavement Association have given more than 60,000 to LaHood. Last year, he proposed 2 million in road-paving projects, including at least one 245,000 check that the recipient never sought. The money would help an Illinois cemetery resurface its roadways. \\"Congressman LaHood's staff called me, saying, 'We know your roads are in bad condition. What can we do?' said LuAnn Johnson, executive director of the Oak Ridge Cemetery in Springfield. \\"We were thrilled for the chance for federal dollars.\\" LaHood's road-building earmarks have highlighted his relationship with Cellini, head of the Illinois Asphalt Pavement Association and other businesses. Cellini was indicted in October on charges of shaking down government vendors to raise money for Democratic Gov. Rod Blagojevich. Cellini has longtime ties to Blagojevich and is accused in a separate civil lawsuit of striking a deal with the governor to raise money for him in exchange for control over key state jobs. In a Peoria newspaper article last year that celebrated his career, mayors cheered LaHood's earmarks, with one noting that \\"Ray's fingerprints are on everything around here.\\" LaHood defended using his sway to fund good, local ideas. \\"The reason I went on the Appropriations Committee, the reason other people go on the Appropriations Committee, is they know that it puts them in a position to know where the money is at, to know the people who are doling out the money and to be in the room when the money is being doled out,\\" he said. Some beneficiaries are little known outside the district. LaHood sponsored more than 1 million in earmarks to build a Peoria/NEXT incubator, a technology development project. A Morton, Ill.-based firm, Otto Baum, was chosen in 2006 to build part of the center. The firm wrote LaHood a 2,300 campaign check last year.

He sponsored a 5 million earmark in 2004 to finish the building. Staff researchers Julie Tate and Madonna Lebling contributed to this report.","completion":"The article discusses how Ray LaHood, a former Republican congressman chosen by President-elect Barack Obama to direct federal highway spending, has been an advocate of earmarks, a practice Obama now opposes. LaHood sponsored 60 million in earmarks in the previous year, steering at least 9 million in federal money to campaign donors, according to a Washington Post analysis. An opponent of earmark reform efforts in Congress, LaHood ranks among the top 10 percent in the House for sponsoring earmarks in 2008. This raises questions on how LaHood would administer part of a 775 billion stimulus package directed to the Transportation Department. LaHood has defended his use of earmarks as a way to direct federal money to decaying communities in his district and maintains there is no connection between his earmarks and projects benefiting campaign donors."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It won't do much to give your hair extra volume, but it will protect your hair from heat damage, and prevent it from turning brittle and dry. Be sure to focus the heat protectant on the ends of your hair, which tend to get damaged the easiest. Plan on straightening your hair in at least three layers. If you have very thick hair, or just a lot of it, you will have to work in thinner sections. Take a small, 1 to 2-inch (2.54 to 5.08-centimeter) section of hair, and clamp your iron over it, as close as you can to your scalp without burning yourself. Instead of pulling the iron straight down, pull it upwards towards the ceiling by a few inches/centimeters. When you get halfway across your hair, pull the iron away from your head. Pulling the iron upwards helps create volume, while pulling it away makes it easier on your arm. If your hair is too hot for you to touch, use a hairbrush to handle it. It might also be a good sign that your hair straightener is set to too high of a temperature; you might want to lower the temperature a little. Once you are done, you can move on to the next layer, or gently tease your hair first. If you choose to tease your hair, give it a quick spray with a flexible hairspray to set the style while allowing movement and flow. Always work in layers and small sections. Remember, the thicker your hair is, the more layers you will have to work with. Run your fingers upwards through your hair, starting at the roots. This will give your hair that final lift it needs. If you want to, give your hair a spray with some texturizing hairspray.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? On average, lettuce takes about 30-45 days after you plant the seeds to mature. Make a note on your calendar to begin harvesting after about 30 days has passed. Indoor lettuce plants grow and mature continually, so you can continue harvesting your plant after you've picked it for the first time. Mature indoor lettuce usually grows to about 4 inches (10 cm) tall. See How to Harvest Romaine Lettuce for specific instructions relating to this type of lettuce. Morning is when your plant's most hydrated and at its strongest. If possible, harvest your plant before the late morning or afternoon to attain a healthier yield. If you can't harvest in the morning, avoid mid-to-late afternoon, which is when your plant's least hydrated. Do not harvest your indoor lettuce plant all at once. As long as you continue taking care of it, you can harvest it for several months. Cut 3-4 of the outer leaves at a time with garden shears or scissors, leaving the rest of the plant to heal and grow back later on. Avoid picking the lettuce's crown or center. Limit yourself to the outer leaves to boost its overall harvesting yield. Depending on the variety, lettuce can last anywhere between 3-10 days in the refrigerator. Check how long your specific variety lasts for and, after placing the lettuce in the fridge, plan to use it by its expiration date. If you don't think you'll use your lettuce in 5-8 days, wait a few days before harvesting your plant. Your plant requires about 2 weeks to heal and grow more leaves before it is ready to harvest again. After your first time harvesting, wait 2 weeks in-between harvesting to keep your plant healthy and able to grow more leaves. Wait at least 2 weeks before harvesting young plants, which may take time to grow strong after being harvested. Sow additional seeds every 2 weeks to extend your harvest.","completion":"This article explains how to maintain and harvest indoor lettuce plants, discussing optimal harvest times, the best methods for picking leaves, and maintaining plant health to achieve a steady supply of fresh lettuce for an extended period."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize: The gate at Nelson Mandela Place in the city centre was put in place by Glasgow City Council at the end of June 2014. Nearly 70,000 charge notices were issued to car drivers between then and the end of July this year. But, more than a third of those fined have not paid up. Councils say the gates aid public transport efficiency. The fines paid by drivers who used the single bus gate during its first year were greater than the total amount of bus gate and bus lane fines in both Edinburgh and Aberdeen in 2013. Cars were banned from driving through Nelson Mandela Place - close to Buchanan Street, George Square and Queen Street railway station - in a bid to help cut down on traffic in that part of the city centre. Taxis, delivery vehicles, buses and emergency vehicles are still allowed. Initially some drivers complained that the move was not well publicised and claimed the signs warning of the bus gate were inadequate. Some also wrongly assumed that the gate was a temporary measure during the 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth Games. If a motorist issued with a notice pays up within 14 days, they are charged £30 - and most do pay up within a fortnight. If they pay up later, they are charged £60. Councils across Scotland are adamant bus gates are only put in place to help the environment and public transport, and strongly deny claims from opponents that they are a source of revenue. Even the £1.3m from Nelson Mandela Place is still a drop in the ocean compared to Glasgow City Council's annual budget of more than £2bn. In July and August last year, 30,000 notices were issued to motorists. The number then fell substantially in September to 5,000 and has gradually declined since. Approximately 10,000 notices were served between April and July this year - 2,334 of them last month. If all the motorists who received a notice last month pay up within 30 days, the fines will total £70,000. Councillor Alistair Watson, Glasgow City Council's executive member for Sustainability and Transport, said: \\"One of the aims of the bus gate is to reduce the number of vehicles travelling through the city centre, while improving provision for public transport. \\"There is always a period of adjustment when new restrictions are introduced. It's clear from the reduction in offences that drivers are aware of the bus lanes and have modified the route they take. \\"The majority of the city's drivers won't receive bus lane charges since they don't drive through what is now a well-known and very visible bus gate. \\"The number of offences has dropped significantly and hopefully we will see even further reductions. Most drivers contravening the bus gate pay the penalty within 14 days which reduces their fine to £30.\\" In 2013, Edinburgh City Council received £718,000 from bus lane fines while Aberdeen City Council received £896,000. That year Glasgow received a total of £3,283,776.","completion":"In June 2014, Glasgow City Council installed a bus gate at Nelson Mandela Place to reduce traffic in the city center, allowing only buses, taxis, delivery vehicles, and emergency vehicles to pass. Despite issuing nearly 70,000 charge notices to car drivers by the end of July this year, more than a third remain unpaid. The council argues the bus gate improves public transportation efficiency, and payments from fines in the gate's first year were higher than those for bus gate and lane fines in Edinburgh and Aberdeen combined in 2013. Initially, some drivers complained about inadequate publicity and signage concerning the bus gate, with some incorrectly assuming it was a temporary measure during the 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth Games. A motorist issued within a notice has 14 days to pay a £30 charge, and most do comply within that time frame. If a driver pays after two weeks, they face a £60 charge. Scottish councils insist that bus gates are installed for the sake of the environment and public transport, not as a revenue source. The £1.3 million collected from Nelson Mandela Place is dwarfed by Glasgow City Council's £2 billion annual budget. The number of notices given to motorists peaked at 30,000 last year during July and August, decreasing to 5,000 in September and continuing to decline gradually, with approximately 10,000 notices given between April and July this year. Councillor Alistair Watson, Glasgow City Council's executive member for Sustainability and Transport, noted that a reduction in offenses shows drivers adapting to the new restrictions, and he anticipates further decreases in the future.

Here's the math part, don't worry, we'll do it together: 0 = -39h + 137h - 1176 First, we need to add the weights with h in them. So we add -39h and 137h. Think of it like this: you have 137 toys but someone takes away 39 toys from you. You do 137 - 39, and you have 98 toys. So now, our balance looks like this: 0 = 98h - 1176 Next, we need to find out how many 98s are hidden inside the 1176. To do this, we'll add 1176 to both sides of the balance and then divide both sides by 98. It's like making equal groups with all the toys we have. When we do this, we find out we have: (0 + 1176) / 98 = 1176 / 98 12 = h So, our final answer is that h is equal to 12.

Had the original casting idea been kept (hunting Rutger, not Ice-T), this movie might have worked. Sadly, racism had to come into the picture (literally) and mess it up. The predominantly black production staff couldn't allow the antagonist be black, so they swapped Rutger's and Ice-T's roles. This was only the start of the downward spiral of this film.

Answer the above question based on the context below: At the time of the transfer of power, the state of Jammu and Kashmir (widely called \\"Kashmir\\") was ruled by Maharaja Hari Singh, a Hindu, although the state itself had a Muslim majority. Hari Singh was equally hesitant about acceding to either India or Pakistan, as either would have provoked adverse reactions in parts of his kingdom. He signed a Standstill Agreement with Pakistan and proposed one with India as well, but announced that Kashmir intended to remain independent. However, his rule was opposed by Sheikh Abdullah, the popular leader of Kashmir's largest political party, the National Conference, who demanded his abdication.Pakistan, attempting to force the issue of Kashmir's accession, cut off supplies and transport links. The chaos in Punjab resulting from Partition had also severed transport links with India, meaning that Kashmir's only links with the two dominions was by air. Rumours about atrocities against the Muslim population of Poonch by the Maharajah's forces caused the outbreak of civil unrest. Shortly thereafter, Pathan tribesmen from the North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan crossed the border and entered Kashmir. The invaders made rapid progress towards Srinagar. The Maharaja of Kashmir wrote to India, asking for military assistance. India required the signing of an Instrument of Accession and setting up an interim government headed by Sheikh Abdullah in return. The Maharaja complied, but Nehru declared that it would have to be confirmed by a plebiscite, although there was no legal requirement to seek such confirmation.Indian troops secured Jammu, Srinagar and the valley itself during the First Kashmir War, but the intense fighting flagged with the onset of winter, which made much of the state impassable. Prime Minister Nehru, recognising the degree of international attention brought to bear on the dispute, declared a ceasefire and sought UN arbitration, arguing that India would otherwise have to invade Pakistan itself, in view of its failure to stop the tribal incursions.

The land that the station and garage is built upon is coveted by businessman Victor Hazell (Robbie Coltrane), who owns the surrounding land and lives in a large mansion several miles away. He attempts to buy the Smiths' land, but William turns down his offers. Used to getting his own way, he begins a campaign of harassment, trying to force them off their land. Several inspectors from the local council come and assess William's property, and it becomes obvious that Hazell has sent them there by alerting them with false stories. William decides to poach Hazell's prized game pheasants in retribution, using raisins to lure them out, but comes home empty handed; Danny had detected his absence and was relieved to see him return. Afterwards, he reveals that he was out poaching. A while afterwards, William informs Danny that he will be going out poaching again at night. Danny wakes up during the night, detects his absence (he had promised to be back three hours before), and decides to go and look for him. He heads for the forest at the wheel of a vintage Austin Seven that William had been repairing, but on the way there he passes a police car, which turns around to pursue him after the officers realized that the car was being driven by an underage driver. He manages to shake them off by darting through a gap in the roadside hedges and driving along a country lane until he reaches the forest.

How is \\"If he so much as opened the door, he would be gone for good.\\" said in Czech?","completion":"The English sentence \\"If he so much as opened the door, he would be gone for good.\\" can be translated into Czech as: \\"Pokud by jen otevřel dveře, byl by navždy pryč.\\" Let me break down the Czech translation for you: - \\"Pokud\\" means \\"if\\" in Czech and is used to express conditional statements, just like in English. - \\"by jen\\" is the equivalent of \\"so much as\\" and is used to emphasize the smallest action necessary for the result to happen. In Czech, the word \\"jen\\" usually comes right after the verb it refers to, and the auxiliary verb \\"by\\" is placed before the subject. - \\"otevřel dveře\\" translates to \\"opened the door\\": \\"otevřel\\" is the past tense masculine singular form of the Czech verb \\"otevřít\\" (to open), and \\"dveře\\" means \\"the door\\" in plural form, which is standard usage in Czech, even when referring to just one door. - \\"byl by\\" means \\"he would be\\" and is a conditional tense construction in Czech, combining the past participle \\"byl\\" (was) with the conditional auxiliary \\"by.\\" - \\"navždy\\" means \\"forever\\" or \\"for good,\\" implying the permanency of the situation. - \\"pryč\\" means \\"gone\\" or \\"away.\\" So, in the context of the sentence, the Czech translation \\"Pokud by jen otevřel dveře, byl by navždy pryč\\" captures the original meaning and nuance of the English sentence, effectively conveying the idea that opening the door would result in a permanent departure."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

She climbed the tree in the rain, but not in the wind, because the","completion":"wind made the branches sway unpredictably. The raindrops fell softly upon her face, an orchestra of droplets serenading her as she ascended. With each step, she felt more connected to the tree, its wooden limbs offering support and solace in her time of need. Step 1: Remember the context for the next part of the story. In this story, the protagonist is climbing a tree in the rain, feeling a connection with tree and nature as she climbs higher. Step 2: Determine the main character's goal or purpose for climbing the tree. Considering the actions and emotions of the protagonist, it's essential to understand why she is doing this. Maybe she is looking for a place to think or seeking an escape from the outside world. Step 3: Develop the protagonist's thoughts and feelings. As she climbed higher, she looked down at the increasingly distant ground below, the concerns of her earthly life fading into insignificance. Surrounded by the gentle rustling of leaves, she embraced the sense of isolation that came with her height. This tree was her sanctuary, where she could leave her worries behind. Step 4: Introduce an external factor that affects the main character. As she reached the upper branches of the tree, she noticed a small bird's nest tucked away between two limbs. Inside, a baby bird was struggling against the cold rain, its mother nowhere to be seen. Step 5: Show the protagonist's response to this external factor. A wave of compassion washed over her, and she knew she couldn't leave this tiny creature to face the storm alone. She delicately lifted the shivering bird and tucked it close to her chest, providing warmth and protection. Step 6: Build the character's connection to this external factor. With their shared experience of finding refuge in the tree, a bond began to form between the girl and the baby bird. She couldn't help but think that their lives mirrored one another in some way - both seeking shelter from their respective storms. Step 7: Create a resolution or realization for the protagonist. As she carefully climbed back down the tree with the tiny bird still pressed to her chest, she realized that they were both stronger than their adversities. The tree, in all its steadfastness, had taught her an invaluable lesson - that even in the face of the harshest storms, she had the strength to stand tall and endure, just as the tree did. Step 8: Conclude the story by connecting back to the beginning. She reached the ground, the rain still falling softly around her. With a new sense of determination, she vowed to carry this lesson with her always, walking away from the tree with a renewed resilience, ready to face whatever storms life had in store for her."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The sentence in question displays a critical tone towards Godard's vision, employing language that represents a negative perspective. The use of words such as \\"slack complacency,\\" \\"tinny self-righteousness,\\" and \\"cannot disguise\\" reveal an unfavorable assessment of both Godard's vision and the soundtrack associated with it. In breaking down the sentence further, we can observe several negative elements: 1. \\"Slack complacency\\": The word \\"slack\\" suggests a lack of energy or effort, while \\"complacency\\" refers to self-satisfaction, often without merit. This phrase implies that Godard's vision is perceived as lazy and unwarranted in its confidence. 2. \\"Cannot disguise\\": This phrase implies that some attempts were made to hide the faults in Godard's vision but have ultimately failed. 3. \\"Gorgeous piano and strings on the soundtrack\\": This part of the sentence introduces a contrasting element—the beautiful music associated with the project. However, the beauty of the music is then negated by its inability to override or \\"drown out\\" the negative aspects of Godard's vision. 4. \\"Tinny self-righteousness of his voice\\": Using the word \\"tinny\\" to describe Godard's voice accentuates its unpleasant nature, while \\"self-righteousness\\" further emphasizes the sense of unjustified confidence or superiority in his vision.

The Domesday Survey of 1086 does not directly mention Ashton, perhaps because only a partial survey of the area had been taken. However, it is thought that St Michael's Church, mentioned in the Domesday entry for the ancient parish of Manchester, was in Ashton (also spelt Asheton, Asshton and Assheton). The town itself was first mentioned in the 12th century when the manor was part of the barony of Manchester. By the late 12th century, a family who adopted the name Assheton held the manor on behalf of the Gresleys, barons of Manchester. Ashton Old Hall was a manor house, the administrative centre of the manor, and the seat of the de Ashton or de Assheton family. With three wings, the hall was \\"one of the finest great houses in the North West\\" of the 14th century. It has been recognised as important for being one of the few great houses in south-east Lancashire and possibly one of the few halls influenced by French design in the country. The town was granted a Royal Charter in 1414, which allowed it to hold a fair twice a year, and a market on every Monday, making the settlement a market town.According to popular tradition, Sir Ralph de Assheton, who was lord of the manor in the mid-14th century and known as the Black Knight, was an unpopular and cruel feudal lord. After his death, his unpopularity led the locals to parade an effigy of him around the town each Easter Monday and collect money. Afterwards the effigy would be hung up, shot, and set on fire, before being torn apart and thrown into the crowd. The first recorded occurrence of the event was in 1795, although the tradition may be older; it continued into the 1830s.The manor remained in the possession of the Assheton family until 1514 when its male line terminated. The lordship of the manor passed to Sir George Booth, great-great grandson of Sir Thomas Ashton, devolving through the Booth family until the Earls of Stamford inherited it through marriage in 1758.

The premiere, originally planned for 14 September 1863, was postponed to the 30th because of the illness of the soprano lead, Léontine de Maësen. The first-night audience at the Théâtre Lyrique received the work well, and called for Bizet at the conclusion. The writer Louis Gallet, who later would provide several librettos for Bizet, described the composer on this occasion as \\"a little dazed ... a forest of thick curly hair above a round, still rather childish face, enlivened by the quick brown eyes...\\" The audience's appreciation was not reflected in the majority of the press reviews, which generally castigated both the work and what they considered Bizet's lack of modesty in appearing on stage. Gustave Bertrand in Le Ménestrel wrote that \\"this sort of exhibition is admissible only for a most extraordinary success, and even then we prefer to have the composer dragged on in spite of himself, or at least pretending to be\\". Another critic surmised that the calls for the composer had been orchestrated by a \\"claque\\" of Bizet's friends, strategically distributed.Of the opera itself, Benjamin Jouvin of Le Figaro wrote: \\"There were neither fishermen in the libretto nor pearls in the music\\". He considered that on every page the score displayed \\"the bias of the school to which [Bizet] belongs, that of Richard Wagner\\". Bertrand compared the work unfavourably with those of contemporary French composers such as Charles Gounod and Félicien David. \\"Nevertheless\\", he wrote, \\"there is a talent floating in the midst of all these regrettable imitations\\". Hector Berlioz was a voice apart in the general critical hostility; his review of the work in Journal des Débats praised the music's originality and subtlety: \\"The score of Les pêcheurs de perles does M. Bizet the greatest honour\\", he wrote.

I hadn't heard much about it; only that it was a tightly-paced thriller, shot digitally on a very low budget. I was hoping to catch the next big Brit-Flick. But I have to say, I was severely disappointed. \\"This Is Not A Love Song\\" follows two criminals, who, after accidentally shooting and killing a farmer's young daughter, become embroiled in a deadly game of cat and mouse when the locals decide to take matters into their own hands and hunt them down. The real problem is that this is yet another example of style over substance in a British film. The camera angles and editing are completely at odds with the story, as are the over the top performances, and the appalling use of slow motion, which only serves to make the whole thing look like an expensive home video. There are repeated attempts to make the film look edgy and gritty, which instead come over as hilarious and over the top(Cue a pathetic, obligatory drug scene, and countless, pointless camera zooms). No amount of cliche's such as this can disguise the fact that this is a pretty bad story. We've seen this kind of thing many times before, and made a hundred times better, particularly in John Boorman's masterful \\"Deliverance.\\" But while in the latter film, we actually cared about the characters, in this film, I found myself just wanting them to be hunted down and killed as quickly as possible. Even this wouldn't have been so bad if their adversaries had been frightening or worthwhile, but instead, are merely a collection of stereotypical, inbred-looking countryfolk. Again, another offensive, overused cliche' coming to the fore. Surely there are some nice people in the country, filmmakers? In its defense, \\"This Is Not A Love Song\\" does contain a couple of good, suspenseful moments, but it's hard to see this film doing anything other than going straight to video, or, at a push, getting a very limited cinema release.

Evans' first-quarter performance was a Buffalo record for a period and just shy of the NFL record for yards receiving in a quarter of 210 by Baltimore's Qadry Ismail in 1999. The first touchdown came after Nate Clements' interception on the third play of the game. Both were after Evans got in front of Texans cornerback Demarcus Faggins for the easy score.

Everything, all life forms and human beings, state Samkhya scholars, have these three gunas, but in different proportions. The interplay of these gunas defines the character of someone or something, of nature and determines the progress of life.

Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the naked eye from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes. - CoRoT (French: ; English: COnvection ROtation and planetary Transits) is a space observatory mission led by the French Space Agency (CNES) in conjunction with the European Space Agency (ESA) and other international partners. The mission's two objectives are to search for extrasolar planets with short orbital periods, particularly those of large terrestrial size, and to perform asteroseismology by measuring solar-like oscillations in stars. - CoRoT ( French : COnvection ROtation et Transits planétaires ; English : COnvection ROtation and planetary Transits ) is a space mission led by the French Space Agency ( CNES ) in conjunction with the European Space Agency ( ESA ) and other international partners . The mission 's two objectives are to search for extrasolar planets with short orbital periods , particularly those of large terrestrial size , and to perform asteroseismology by measuring solar - like oscillations in stars . It was launched at 14:28:00 UTC on 27 December 2006 , atop a Soyuz 2.1b carrier rocket , reporting first light on 18 January 2007 . Subsequently , the probe started to collect science data on 2 February 2007 . CoRoT is the first spacecraft dedicated to the detection of transiting extrasolar planets , opening the way for more advanced probes such as Kepler as well as future missions such as TESS and PLATO . It detected its first extrasolar planet , COROT - 1b , in May 2007 , just 3 months after the start of the observations . Mission flight operations were originally scheduled to end 2.5 years from launch but operations were extended to 2013 . On 2 November 2012 , CoRoT suffered a computer failure that made it impossible to retrieve any data from its telescope . After repair attempts , on 24 June 2013 , it was announced that CoRoT has been retired and would be decommissioned ; lowered in orbit to allow it to burn up in the atmosphere . - Asteroseismology is the study of oscillations in stars. Because a star's different oscillation modes are sensitive to different parts of the star, they inform astronomers about the internal structure of the star, which is otherwise not directly possible from overall properties like brightness and surface temperature. Asteroseismology is closely related to helioseismology, the study of stellar oscillations specifically in the Sun. Though both are based on the same underlying physics, more and qualitatively different information is available for the Sun because its surface can be resolved. - Oscillation is the repetitive variation, typically in time, of some measure about a central value (often a point of equilibrium) or between two or more different states. The term \\"vibration\\" is precisely used to describe mechanical oscillation. Familiar examples of oscillation include a swinging pendulum and alternating current power. - The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process.<ref name=\\"doi10.1146/annurev-astro-081913-040012\\"></ref> It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. About three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron. - Solar-like oscillations are oscillations in distant stars that are excited in the same way as those in the Sun, namely by turbulent convection in its outer layers. Stars that show solar-like oscillations are called solar-like oscillators. The oscillations are standing pressure and mixed pressure-gravity modes that are excited over a range in frequency, with the amplitudes roughly following a bell-shaped distribution. Unlike opacity-driven oscillators, all the modes in the frequency range are excited, making the oscillations relatively easy to identify. The surface convection also damps the modes, and each is well-approximated in frequency space by a Lorentzian curve, the width of which corresponds to the lifetime of the mode: the faster it decays, the broader is the Lorentzian. All stars with surface convection zones are expected to show solar-like oscillations, including cool main-sequence stars (up to surface temperatures of about 7000K), subgiants and red giants. Because of the small amplitudes of the oscillations, their study has advanced tremendously thanks to space-based missions (mainly COROT and Kepler). - Helioseismology is the study of the propagation of wave oscillations, particularly acoustic pressure waves, in the Sun. Unlike seismic waves on Earth, solar waves have practically no shear component (s-waves). Solar pressure waves are believed to be generated by the turbulence in the convection zone near the surface of the sun. Certain frequencies are amplified by constructive interference. In other words, the turbulence \\"rings\\" the sun like a bell. The acoustic waves are transmitted to the outer photosphere of the sun, which is where the light generated through absorption of radiant energy from nuclear fusion at the centre of the sun, leaves the surface. These oscillations are detectable on almost any time series of solar images, but are best observed by measuring the Doppler shift of photospheric absorption lines. Changes in the propagation of oscillation waves through the Sun reveal inner structures and allow astrophysicists to develop extremely detailed profiles of the interior conditions of the Sun.

Constipation is not a glamorous topic, but it’s certainly important, especially in older adults. As anyone who has experienced occasional — or even chronic — constipation can tell you, it can really put a damper on quality of life and well-being. Constipation can also cause more substantial problems, such as: * Severe abdominal pain, which can lead to emergency room visits * Hemorrhoids, which can bleed or be painful * Increased irritability, agitation, or even aggression, in people with Alzheimer’s disease or other forms of dementia * Stress and/or pain that can contribute to delirium (a state of new or worse confusion that often happens when older adults are hospitalized) * Fecal incontinence, which can be caused or worsened by having a hard lump of stool lodged in the lower bowel * Avoidance of needed pain medication, due to fear of constipation Fortunately, it’s usually possible to help older adults effectively manage and prevent constipation. This helps maintain well-being and quality of life, and can also improve difficult behaviors related to dementia. The trouble is that constipation is often either overlooked or sub-optimally managed by busy healthcare providers who aren’t trained in geriatrics. They are often focused on more “serious” health issues. Also, since many laxatives are available over-the-counter, some providers may assume that people will treat themselves if necessary. Personally, I don’t like this hands-off approach to constipation. Although several useful laxatives are indeed available over-the-counter (OTC), I’ve found that the average person doesn’t know enough to correctly choose among them. Also, although in geriatrics we often do end up recommending or prescribing laxatives, it’s vital to start by figuring out what is likely to be causing — or worsening — an older person’s constipation. For instance, many medications can make constipation worse, so we usually make an attempt to identify and perhaps deprescribe those. In short, if you’re an older adult, or if you’re helping an older... According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? how do you play tag?","completion":"Playing tag is a simple, fun, and engaging game that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. It is an ideal activity for socializing, developing physical fitness, and honing motor skills. To play tag, you will require a group of players, ideally consisting of at least 3 or more participants, and a suitable outdoor or indoor area where everyone can move around safely. Here is a detailed guide on how to play tag: 1. Choose a location: Find a spacious and safe area to play the game, such as a park, backyard, playground, or a gymnasium. The location should provide enough space for the players to move around freely and comfortably. Make sure to clear any potential hazards or obstacles that might cause injuries. 2. Gather participants: Invite a group of friends, family members, or classmates to join the game. As mentioned earlier, having at least 3 participants is recommended, but tag can be played with a larger group for added excitement and entertainment. 3. Set boundaries: Determine the playing area by marking its boundaries. This can be done using cones, rope, or a natural landmark, like a tree or a fence. Inform all players of the designated boundaries, and ensure that they understand the importance of staying within the playing area throughout the game. 4. Select a 'tagger': One person in the group will begin as the 'tagger' or 'it.' This individual is responsible for chasing and trying to tag other players. The selection of the first 'tagger' can be done through various methods such as a random draw, a vote, or a quick game of rock-paper-scissors. 5. Explain the rules: Before starting the game, make sure all participants understand the rules of tag. They are: - The tagger's objective is to touch or 'tag' another player. - When a player is tagged, they become the new 'tagger' and must now chase and tag other players. - Players cannot tag the person who just tagged them (also known as \\"no tag-backs\\" rule). - If a player accidentally steps outside the designated boundaries, they will become the new 'tagger.' - The game continues until everyone agrees to stop playing, or a predetermined time limit or number of rounds have been reached. 6. Begin the game: The first tagger will count down from a predetermined number (usually 10 or 20) out loud, during which time the other players will scatter around the playing area. Once the countdown is finished, the tagger will shout 'Go!' or 'Tag!' to signal the start of the game. 7. Play and tag: The tagger will now chase after the other players in an attempt to tag them. Players must avoid being tagged by running, dodging or using other evasive maneuvers. The tagged player will become the new tagger, and the game goes on. 8. Implement variations (optional): To make the game more interesting, you can introduce different variations such as: - Freeze Tag: When a player is tagged, they must freeze in place until another player touches them and 'unfreezes' them. - Shadow Tag: Instead of tagging players by touching them, the tagger must step on their shadow. This version works best on sunny days. - Chain Tag: As players are tagged, they join hands with the tagger, forming a chain. The chain must remain intact while trying to tag other players. 9. End the game: The game concludes when all players decide to stop playing, a predetermined time limit has been reached, or a designated number of rounds have been played. At the end of the game, players can discuss their favorite moments and congratulate each other on their efforts. By following these steps, you can enjoy a fun and active game of tag with your friends or family members. The simplicity of the game allows for various modifications and adaptations, making it suitable to cater to the preferences and abilities of different age groups and fitness levels."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. In which location the Geiger counter would click, location A or location C? Keith landed a job with the EPA. As part of his training he needed to learn how the Geiger counter works. To learn more about the counter he tested it in three different locations, location A, location B, and location C. Location A had very high radiation; location B had low radiation; and location C didn't have any radiation. Keith learned how the counter works in locations with varying degrees of radiation. Hint: You generally can’t see, smell, taste, hear, or feel radiation. Fortunately, there are devices such as Geiger counters that can detect radiation. A Geiger counter, like the one pictured in the Figure below , contains atoms of a gas that is ionized if it encounters radiation. When this happens, the gas atoms change to ions that can carry an electric current. The current causes the Geiger counter to click. The faster the clicks occur, the higher the level of radiation.

Help as much as you can. Q:Ricky, an entomologist, is observing an ant colony in his back yard. After some observation, he discovers that all the ants travel down one of two distinct paths in order to find food to bring back to the colony. After taking some measurements, Ricky sees that path A is approximately 100 meters in length, and path B is approximately 150 meters in length. Ricky is now trying to make some scientific conclusions based on these observations. Which path will be marched over less frequently? Hint: In the natural world, ants of some species (initially) wander randomly, and upon finding food return to their colony while laying down pheromone trails. If other ants find such a path, they are likely not to keep travelling at random, but instead to follow the trail, returning and reinforcing it if they eventually find food (see Ant communication). Over time, however, the pheromone trail starts to evaporate, thus reducing its attractive strength. The more time it takes for an ant to travel down the path and back again, the more time the pheromones have to evaporate. A short path, by comparison, gets marched over more frequently, and thus the pheromone density becomes higher on shorter paths than longer ones. Pheromone evaporation also has the advantage of avoiding the convergence to a locally optimal solution. If there were no evaporation at all, the paths chosen by the first ants would tend to be excessively attractive to the following ones. In that case, the exploration of the solution space would be constrained. The influence of pheromone evaporation in real ant systems is unclear, but it is very important in artificial systems.[8] A:","completion":"Based on the given information, path A will be marched over more frequently due to its shorter length. This is because the ants following the pheromone trails will reach the food source and return to the colony more quickly, reinforcing the pheromone trail. As a result, the pheromone density on path A will become higher than on path B. Therefore, path B will be marched over less frequently compared to path A."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The key phrases in the sentence are: \\"devoid of pleasure or sensuality\\" and \\"cannot even be dubbed hedonistic\\". Step 2: Evaluate the meaning of these key phrases. \\"Devoid of pleasure or sensuality\\" means the movie lacked any enjoyable or pleasurable elements. \\"Cannot even be dubbed hedonistic\\" suggests that, even at its most basic level, the movie doesn't provide indulgence or self-gratification. Step 3: Determine if the phrases are positive or negative. Both phrases have a negative connotation. Step 4: Combine the information of the phrases and determine the overall sentiment. Since both identified key phrases have negative meanings and no positive phrases are present, it can be concluded that the sentiment expressed about the movie in this review is negative.

Please answer the following question: What is the first name of the person who had to had to track down the only draft of the essay at a bar in Tacoma? Answer the above question based on the context below: Freedom from Want was published with an essay by Carlos Bulosan as part of the Four Freedoms series. Bulosan's essay spoke on behalf of those enduring domestic socioeconomic hardships rather than sociopolitical hardships abroad, and it thrust him into prominence. As he neared his thirtieth birthday, the Philippine immigrant and labor organizer Bulosan was experiencing a life that was not consistent with the theme Rockwell depicted in his version of Freedom From Want. Unknown as a writer, he was subsisting as a migrant laborer working intermittent jobs. Post editors tracked down the impoverished immigrant to request an essay contribution. Bulosan rose to prominence during World War II when the Commonwealth of the Philippines, a United States territory, was occupied by Japan. To many Americans, Bulosan's essay marked his introduction, and his name was thereafter well recognized. The essay was lost by The Post, and Bulosan, who had no carbon copy, had to track down the only draft of the essay at a bar in Tacoma.Freedom From Want had previously been less entwined in the standard liberalism philosophies of the western world than the other three freedoms (speech, fear, and religion); this freedom added economic liberty as a societal aspiration. In his essay, Bulosan treats negative liberties as positive liberties by suggesting that Americans be \\"given equal opportunity to serve themselves and each other according to their needs and abilities\\", an echo of Karl Marx's \\"from each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs\\". In the final paragraph of the essay, the phrase \\"The America we hope to see is not merely a physical but also a spiritual and intellectual world\\" describes an egalitarian America. In a voice likened to Steinbeck's in works such as The Grapes of Wrath, Bulosan's essay spoke up for those who struggled to survive in the capitalist democracy and was regarded as \\"haunting and sharp\\" against the backdrop of Rockwell's feast of plenty. It proposed that while citizens had obligations to...

Plot title: The Ten Commandments Movie plot: Pharaoh Rameses I of Egypt has ordered the death of all the firstborn Hebrew male infants after hearing the prophecy of the Deliverer, but a Hebrew mother named Yoshebel saves her own infant son by setting him adrift in a basket on the Nile. Bithiah, the Pharaoh's daughter, who had recently lost both her husband and the hope of ever having children of her own, finds the basket and decides to adopt the boy even though her servant, Memnet, recognizes the child is Hebrew and protests. Because she drew the infant out of the water, Bithiah decides to name the baby Moses. Many years later, Prince Moses grows up to become a successful general, winning a war with Ethiopia and then entering Egypt into an alliance with them. Moses loves Nefretiri, who is the throne princess and must be betrothed to the next Pharaoh. She reciprocates his love. While working on the building of a city for Pharaoh Sethi's jubilee, Moses meets the stonecutter Joshua, who tells him of the Hebrew God. An incident occurs when an elderly woman is almost crushed to death when her sash gets caught under the slab of stone, prompting Moses to scold overseer Baka. Moses frees the elderly woman, not realizing that she is his natural mother, Yoshebel. Moses institutes numerous reforms concerning the treatment of the slaves on the project, and eventually Prince Rameses, Moses's \\"brother\\", charges him with planning an insurrection, pointing out that the slaves are calling him the \\"Deliverer\\". Moses defends himself against the charges, arguing that he is simply making his workers more productive by making them stronger and happier and proves his point with the impressive progress he is making. Rameses had earlier been charged by Sethi with finding out whether there really is a Hebrew fitting the description of the Deliverer. Nefretiri learns from Memnet that Moses is the son of Hebrew slaves.

Here are possible answers to this question: - theater - airplane - theatre - new york city - fieldhouse I believe the correct choice is \\"fieldhouse\\", here's why:","completion":"A catwalk is unlikely to be in a fieldhouse because of the following reasons: 1. Purpose of a catwalk: A catwalk is a narrow, elevated platform or walkway typically found in theaters, concert venues, and fashion shows, where they are used as a stage for models. It serves as an access point for stagehands and technicians to manage elements such as lighting, sound, and rigging in these settings. 2. The nature of a fieldhouse: A fieldhouse is an indoor facility designed for sports and recreational activities. It typically houses courts for basketball, volleyball, and various other indoor sports, as well as tracks, fitness centers, and sometimes even swimming pools. The primary purpose of a fieldhouse is to provide a space for physical activities, not performance arts or fashion shows. Comparing the other options: - Theater and theatre are essentially the same, referring to a venue where plays, musicals, and other performance arts are held. Catwalks are commonly found in these locations. - Airplane: A catwalk would not typically be found on an airplane, but this option isn't relevant, as the context of a catwalk implies being in a location where it serves a specific purpose, such as a theater or fashion show stage. - New York City: As a major city, New York has many theaters, venues, and fashion events where catwalks are present.

Question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which team had fewer runners with muscle weakness? Two teams of runners took part in a study about exercise. Red team ran 10 km in the heat, while Green team ran the same distance in the morning in cool weather. The Red team experienced more runners with health problems. Hint: Millions of people in the world jog for exercise. For the most part, jogging can be a healthy way to stay fit. However, problems can also develop for those who jog in the heat. Excessive sweating can lead to electrolyte loss that could be life-threatening. Early symptoms of electrolyte deficiency can include nausea, fatugue, and dizziness. If not treated, individuals can experience muscle weakness and increased heart rate (which could lead to a heart attack). Many sports drinks can be consumed to restore electrolytes quickly in the body. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information given in the paragraph, the Green team had fewer runners with muscle weakness. This analysis can be reached by considering the specific circumstances in which both teams operated and the potential health issues linked with each situation. The paragraph indicates that the Red team ran 10 km in the heat, while the Green team ran the same distance in the morning in cool weather. Also mentioned is the fact that the Red team experienced more runners with health problems, whereas no specific health issues were pointed out for the Green team. The hint provided further substantiates this conclusion. It underlines that jogging can be a healthy exercise, but it can also lead to issues if done in the heat. This is due to the excessive sweating caused by hot conditions, which can result in serious electrolyte loss. The early symptoms of electrolyte deficiency can include nausea, fatigue, dizziness, muscle weakness, and increased heart rate, potentially leading to a heart attack. Given that the Red team was running in the heat, they would have been more likely to experience these symptoms, especially muscle weakness, which is directly tied to electrolyte deficiency. On the contrary, the Green team ran in cool weather, which should have resulted in less excessive sweating and, consequently, a lower likelihood of experiencing electrolyte deficiency and its related symptoms. Furthermore, the paragraph does not mention whether the Red team consumed any sports drinks to restore their electrolytes quickly. In contrast, the Green team, running in cooler conditions, would likely have sweated less and retained a more balanced electrolyte level, reducing the likelihood of muscle weakness. In conclusion, based on the given information and suggested implications, it can be stated that the Green team had fewer runners experiencing muscle weakness than the Red team."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Saturday slammed China's militarization of disputed South China Sea islands, insisting that weapons systems recently deployed in the area were meant to intimidate and coerce Beijing's neighbors. The comments came during a speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue, an annual Asian defense forum in Singapore. In the speech, Mattis laid out the broader U.S. strategy for a \\"free and open\\" Indo-Pacific region. \\"China's policy in the South China Sea stands in stark contrast to the openness our strategy promotes. It calls into question China's broader goals,\\" Mattis said. Specifically, the Pentagon chief mentioned China's deployment of anti-ship and surface-to-air missiles, electronic jammers, and the landing of a bomber aircraft at the Paracel Islands off the coast of Vietnam. \\"Despite China's claim to the contrary, the placement of these weapon systems is tied directly to military use for the purposes of intimidation and coercion,\\" Mattis added. Though much of the world is focused on an upcoming summit between North Korea and the United States, this year's Shangri-La Dialogue has focused primarily on the region's long-term future and how to deal with a more assertive China. Beijing has begun projecting power beyond its borders, most notably through the construction and militarization of islands in disputed areas of the South China Sea. China claims nearly the entire South China Sea, despite overlapping claims by countries including Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan. Last week, the United States disinvited China from the Rim of the Pacific exercise (RIMPAC), a major international maritime exercise to be held later this year, citing Beijing's behavior in the South China Sea. Mattis on Saturday referred to that disinvitation as an \\"initial response\\" to China, but he did not outline any additional steps that might be taken. \\"The U.S. will continue to pursue a constructive, results-oriented relationship with China, cooperating when possible and competing vigorously where...

Identify the different layers of the Earth's atmosphere 2. Determine the lowest layer 3. Find out its height above the Earth's surface Step 1: Identify the different layers of the Earth's atmosphere The Earth's atmosphere is divided into several layers, which are: - Troposphere - Stratosphere - Mesosphere - Thermosphere - Exosphere Step 2: Determine the lowest layer The troposphere is the lowest layer of the Earth's atmosphere. Step 3: Find out its height above the Earth's surface The troposphere extends from the Earth's surface up to a height of approximately 7 to 20 kilometers (4 to 12 miles), with the height varying depending on the latitude. At the poles, it may be as low as 7 kilometers (4 miles) while at the equator, it can be up to 20 kilometers (12 miles) high. On average, the troposphere is roughly around 10 kilometers (6 miles) high. However, in the question, it is mentioned that the height is approximately 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) above the Earth's surface. It means we are talking about the lowest part of the troposphere. So, the lowest part of the Earth's atmosphere, 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) above the Earth's surface, is located within the troposphere."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

The smoke of the incense filled the whole room and started to choke people because the","completion":"ventilation was poor. As the thick, fragrant cloud began to permeate every corner of the space, it became apparent that something needed to be done. Step 1: Assess the situation First, it was crucial to determine the severity of the problem and identify if anyone was in immediate danger. Acute symptoms of exposure to excessive incense smoke include coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, and people with pre-existing respiratory conditions may be more vulnerable to the effects. Step 2: Open windows and doors In order to improve the air circulation in the room and help dissipate the dense smoke, all windows and doors needed to be opened. This would allow fresh air to enter the space and provide relief for those affected by the heavy fumes. Step 3: Turn off the incense To prevent the situation from becoming worse, it was essential to stop the source of the smoke. By extinguishing the incense or removing it from the room, the risk of further irritation or health complications would be minimized. Step 4: Use fans to speed up air circulation If available, portable fans could be strategically placed near windows and doorways to help accelerate the flow of fresh air and disperse the remaining smoke more quickly. Step 5: Monitor and attend to affected individuals As the air cleared, it was crucial to check on those who had exhibited symptoms or discomfort due to the incense smoke. If anyone appeared to be struggling or in distress, it might be necessary to seek medical attention. Step 6: Implement safety measures for future gatherings To avoid a similar incident from occurring in the future, understanding the importance of proper ventilation and regulating the use of incense during gatherings would be essential. Knowing the appropriate quantity of incense to use and ensuring adequate air circulation could prevent such issues from arising again. Through swift and well-thought-out actions, we managed to resolve the situation and restore a more comfortable environment for everyone in the room. As the lingering traces of incense smoke gradually dissipated, we could once again focus on the gathering at hand, with a renewed appreciation for the importance of taking precautions when burning incense indoors."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given those answer options, answer the question: I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: What generates gamma radiation Suggested answer: Legend Should I validate this answer? A:","completion":"When verifying the validity of an answer generated by an automatic system, it is crucial to have a thorough understanding of the topic at hand. In this case, the question pertains to the generation of gamma radiation. Gamma radiation falls under the category of electromagnetic radiation and is characterized by its high energy and short wavelength. It is the most energetic and penetrating type of radiation in the electromagnetic spectrum. Gamma radiation is typically produced by various nuclear reactions, atomic transitions, and high-energy astrophysical phenomena. The suggested answer, \\"Legend,\\" is not appropriate for the given question. A more accurate response would be to explain the main sources and processes that generate gamma radiation. These include: 1. Radioactive decay: Gamma radiation is often produced when atomic nuclei undergo a process known as radioactive decay. During decay, unstable atomic nuclei lose energy by emitting radiation in the form of gamma rays. Commonly known radioactive materials, such as uranium and plutonium, can emit gamma radiation due to their unstable isotopes. 2. Nuclear reactions: Gamma rays can also be generated through nuclear reactions such as nuclear fission and fusion processes. In nuclear fission, heavy atomic nuclei, like those of uranium and plutonium, are split into lighter nuclei, which release gamma radiation along with other particles like neutrons. On the other hand, nuclear fusion, which occurs in stars like the Sun, involves the joining of lighter atomic nuclei to form heavier isotopes, and this process can also emit gamma radiation. 3. Cosmic phenomena: Gamma rays are generated in cosmic events such as supernovae, black holes, and active galactic nuclei. Supernovae are massive explosions that result from the dying of massive stars and involve the release of vast amounts of energy, including gamma radiation. Active galactic nuclei, like quasars and blazars, are known to emit gamma rays as a result of the high-energy processes occurring in the vicinity of supermassive black holes. 4. Particle interactions: Gamma radiation can also be created during the interaction of high-energy particles. For example, when cosmic rays (high-energy particles from space) collide with the Earth's atmosphere, they can produce high-energy photons in the form of gamma rays. In conclusion, the suggested answer, \\"Legend,\\" should not be validated as a correct response to the question about what generates gamma radiation. Instead, a more accurate and detailed answer should encompass the various sources and processes that produce gamma radiation, including radioactive decay, nuclear reactions, cosmic phenomena, and particle interactions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Even if you want to..I am anonymous for the same reason. So this happened when I was 16 year old. I belong to a very humble and conservative family, from Indore. @I never had a lot of exposure to guys, until we went to attend a marriage of one of our wealthy relatives in Delhi.. it was one of the best times I had, as we had a group of 4–5 similar aged cousins, though most of them were very distant relatives. One of them was a 19 year old dude, and he was kind of cute. But I never thought I would have this urge to you know… it was teenage and everything seemed new and exciting. So the second day, after having roamed all around Noida, we finally returned to our hotel and that guy accompanied me to my room. I asked him if he wants to come in as my parents were involved in the late night Sangeet rehearsals. He nodded gently and before I could know, we were cuddling and watching TV. I felt like a rebel, though it was the strangest and least expected thing I had done. Then he kissed me. Before I knew it I let him in my mouth …and he kept rolling his tongue on mine. It was my first kiss, and I don't regret it. The warmth of his mouth, the wetness of his lips and his breath felt like the only thing I ever wanted. I was a teen so please not judge.

Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: In 1924 mountaineer George Mallory was torn between love for his wife Ruth, and his obsession with the last great adventure left to man: becoming the first person to reach the summit of the untouched Mount Everest. Dressed in gabardine and wearing hobnailed boots, Mallory risked everything in pursuit of his dream, but was last seen alive 800 feet below the summit. Then the clouds rolled in and he disappeared. After discovering Malloryâs body on Everest in 1999, modern climber Conrad Ankerâs life became intertwined with Malloryâs story. Malloryâs frozen body was found with his belongings intact; the only thing missing was a photograph of Ruth, which Mallory had promised to place on the summit.

It’s quite uncommon, but essentially I can get an excruciating migraine in my arm, leg, etc., on top of getting them in my head/temples. For years my family and I had no idea what was happening, and with no vocabulary to properly explain what was happening, I described it for about fifteen years as “beeping.” Doctors told us it was anything from growth spurts to a grab for attention, and for a while I gave up trying to figure out what they were. When they got worse and I couldn’t ignore them anymore, I was finally sent to a neurologist, who diagnosed me with ice pick headaches. I let out a sigh of relief that I didn’t even know I was holding in; I felt like I could finally breathe. Years of stress and confusion washed off of me, and I started taking a beta blocker to prevent them. I’ve been on them for a few years now, and it’s changed my life for the better. I used to be terrified of learning to drive, for many reasons, but a large one being that if I got an ice pick headache on the road, I couldn’t guarantee the safety of those around me if I was at the wheel. Now I’m considering finally getting my license (considering - I still don’t like being behind the wheel), I don’t double over in white hot pain randomly anymore, and when I do get a cluster headache, I can still function. It almost sounds a little silly, but really, they were crippling, and being able to work through them on my own? It’s the greatest gift I’ve given to myself. You know yourself better than anyone, even if you feel like you don’t know yourself. If something feels wrong, don’t just live with it - keep pushing for a correct diagnosis! The author got diagnosed: - after beginning beta blockers. - after 15 years of describing the headaches as \\"beeping\\". - not enough information - before the headaches got worse. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Your journey towards diagnosis and treatment of your rare form of cluster/ice-pick headaches is both inspiring and informative. It demonstrates the imperative need for perseverance in pursuit of a correct and detailed health diagnosis. Your description of the 'beeping' sensation serves as a testament to the unique and individual nature of different symptoms and illnesses, underlining the fact that body experiences are unique and vary greatly from person to person. It's unfortunate that your condition was misinterpreted for many years, however, in spite of it all, you persevered and continued seeking for answers, a testament to your resilience. It’s heart-rending to think that it took about fifteen years for you to have a correct diagnosis, a period during which the medical professionals you saw came up with completely unrelated diagnoses, like growth spurts or a supposed attention-seeking behavior. This points to an important fact: sometimes, healthcare professionals may overlook unfamiliar symptoms or interpret them incorrectly due to the vast array of possible health conditions, their limited knowledge of rare conditions, time constraints, and perhaps a certain level of bias in their diagnostic thinking. However, the day came when you were finally sent to a neurologist and you got correctly diagnosed with ice pick headaches. The relief you felt was not only physical but also emotional – the vindication of finally receiving a correct diagnosis, acknowledgement, and the promise of a possible solution to chronic pain. It’s understandable that this was a profound moment in your life, one that brought instant relief and renewed hopes for a healthier life. Your decision to start taking a beta blocker as treatment for ice pick headaches speaks to the importance of appropriate and targeted interventions in managing health conditions. This medication has proved to significantly change your life for the better, substantially reducing the frequency and severity of your headaches. It has also given you the freedom to consider things like learning to drive, an activity that was initially a big concern for you due to the sudden onset and potentially debilitating impact of the headaches. All these changes in your life underscore the transformative power of a correct diagnosis and appropriate treatments. Furthermore, your experiences point out the importance of self-advocacy in healthcare. Patients have to be active participants in their own healthcare, continually pushing for a correct diagnosis, and appropriate treatment. Your story is undoubtedly an encouragement to others experiencing similar puzzling symptoms to persist in seeking answers. It also emphasizes the importance of a proper dialogue between doctors and patients, and the necessity for healthcare professionals to invest quality time in reaching an accurate diagnosis. Your story acts as a beacon of hope, demonstrating that, with the right diagnosis and correct treatment, it’s entirely possible to significantly improve quality of life, even with a challenging and rare condition like ice-pick headaches."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

For years China has been under a sea of rotting plastic bags , billions casually dumped every year . Since June this year , this tide of garbage had begun to ebb . How would the narrator be described in light of these comments ?","completion":"The narrator could be described as observant, informed, analytical, hopeful, and environmentally-conscious in light of these comments. Here's why: Observant: The narrator presents information about China's long-standing issue with plastic waste, pointing out that the problem has persisted \\"for years\\". This suggests that they have been watching the situation closely over a sustained period of time. Thus, we can regard them as vigilant and perceptive. Informed: The specifics provided—for instance, stating that \\"billions\\" of plastic bags are \\"casually dumped every year\\"—indicate that the narrator is well-educated on the matter under discussion. They employ precise data to substantiate their statements, which shows a commitment to accuracy and research. Analytical: The narrator's ability to identify \\"positive changes\\" in the transitioning situation demonstrates an analytical instinct. Rather than sticking to the narration of facts, they interpret these facts to evaluate an overall emergent pattern, exemplifying their analytical prowess. Hopeful: The recognition of positivity in an otherwise bleak context—that is, acknowledging that the \\"tide of garbage had begun to ebb\\" despite the copious amounts of waste produced over the years—suggests a hopeful perspective. The narrator seems to believe in the possibility of progress and transformation, no matter how slow or difficult. Environmentally-Conscious: The fact that the narrator focuses on the issue of plastic waste implies a concern for the environment. Their discussion of the problem and its gradual resolution reveals a commitment to and investment in ecological issues. They are aware of humanity's role in creating environmental distress and therefore, likely advocates corrective measures. In summary, based on these comments, one might depict the narrator as a vigilant observer and well-informed analyst who, despite facing the adversity of environmental issues, maintains a hopeful outlook while demonstrating a thoughtful concern for the environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 2: Understand the context of the team's founding - Determine the key events and factors that contributed to the establishment of the New York Red Bulls as an MLS team. Step 3: Synthesize the information - Combine the researched information to create a comprehensive answer to the question. Step 4: Evaluate the suggested statement - Analyze whether the provided statement, \\"The team competes in the Eastern Conference of Major League Soccer (MLS),\\" is sufficient to answer the question or if it needs elaboration. Based on the research, here's a possible answer: The New York Red Bulls, originally known as the New York/New Jersey MetroStars, began in 1995 as one of Major League Soccer's (MLS) ten original founding clubs. The team competes in the Eastern Conference of MLS. In 2006, the club was sold to the Austrian company Red Bull GmbH, and they rebranded the team as the New York Red Bulls. Their entry into MLS was a result of the league's establishment and the desire to have a team representing the New York/New Jersey area. The statement \\"The team competes in the Eastern Conference of Major League Soccer (MLS)\\" is partly accurate, but it doesn't provide enough information to fully answer the question about how they started in MLS.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the person who explains that musicians' girlfriends were routinely described as \\"chicks?\\" Many critics have noted the extraordinary development of Dylan's songwriting immediately after completing his first album. One of Dylan's biographers Clinton Heylin connects the sudden increase in lyrics written along topical and political lines to the fact that Dylan had moved into an apartment on West 4th Street with his girlfriend Suze Rotolo in January 1962. Rotolo's family had strong left-wing political commitments; both of her parents were members of the American Communist Party. Dylan acknowledged her influence when he told an interviewer: \\"Suze was into this equality-freedom thing long before I was. I checked out the songs with her.\\"Dylan's relationship with Rotolo also provided an important emotional dynamic in the composition of the Freewheelin' album. After six months of living with Dylan, Rotolo agreed to her mother's proposal that she travel to Italy to study art. Dylan missed her and wrote long letters to her conveying his hope that she would return soon to New York. She postponed her return several times, finally coming back in January 1963. Critics have connected the intense love songs expressing longing and loss on Freewheelin' to Dylan's fraught relationship with Rotolo. In her autobiography, Rotolo explains that musicians' girlfriends were routinely described as \\"chicks\\", and she resented being regarded as \\"a possession of Bob, who was the center of attention\\".The speed and facility with which Dylan wrote topical songs attracted the attention of other musicians in the New York folk scene. In a radio interview on WBAI in June 1962, Pete Seeger described Dylan as \\"the most prolific songwriter on the scene\\" and then asked Dylan how many songs he had written recently. Dylan replied, \\"I might go for two weeks without writing these songs. I write a lot of stuff. In fact, I wrote five songs last night but I gave all the papers away in some place called the Bitter End.\\" Dylan also expressed the impersonal idea that the songs were not his own creation.

When they move, they have babies, so their number is getting bigger. and will soon threaten Sudan in the northeast of Africa. Some say it may reach Asia. Experts say many people in the areas will go hungry because of this disaster. What's worse, governments in the areas don't have enough things to fight the locusts.

The story primarily focuses on the ongoing battle against a massive locust invasion in West Africa, which has become the largest locust disaster in the region in 15 years. These swarms of locusts are causing significant damage to crops and increasing the risk of hunger for many people in the affected areas. Radio stations like Sud-Fm in Senegal have started initiatives to encourage people to participate in efforts to combat the locusts; for example, offering 5 kilograms of rice as a reward for catching and killing 50 kilograms of locusts. However, the scale of the problem is immense, and the governments in the region lack the resources and adequate plans to effectively combat the locust swarms. Twelve countries have agreed upon a plan to address the disaster, but it is still not sufficient to control the situation. According to Mohamed Abdallahi Ould Babah, the leader of locust control in Mauritania, the efforts to treat affected areas with pesticides must be significantly increased to have any hope of containing the swarms and limiting the damage they cause. As the locust swarms continue moving eastward, there are concerns that they may soon threaten Sudan in northeastern Africa and even potentially reach Asia.

Large island had a lot of seismic activity, and Small island that presented almost no seismic activity. and a hint : Geologists study earthquake waves to “see” Earth's interior. Waves of energy radiate out from an earthquake’s focus. These waves are called seismic waves ( Figure below ). Seismic waves go different speeds through different materials. They change speed when they go from one type of material to another. This causes them to bend. Some seismic waves do not travel through liquids or gases. They just stop. Scientists use information from seismic waves to understand what makes up the Earth’s interior. Please answer this question : Which island displayed more seismic waves? Answer:","completion":"The Large island displayed more seismic waves. In this situation, a team of geologists studied two islands – the Large island with a lot of seismic activity and the Small island with almost no seismic activity. The hint provided gives us an insight into how geologists study seismic waves to understand Earth's interior. Seismic waves are essentially waves of energy that radiate from an earthquake's focus and propagate through the Earth. These waves can be useful in determining the different materials that make up the Earth's interior by observing their behavior and interactions with various materials. Now, since the Large island has a lot of seismic activity, it indicates that there are more frequent earthquakes occurring on this island. This, in turn, implies that there will be more seismic waves generated and observed by geologists studying the island. These seismic waves will allow them to better understand the Earth's interior beneath the Large island and possibly provide more information about the tectonic activity or other geological factors that contribute to the increased seismic activity on this island. Conversely, the Small island presents almost no seismic activity, which implies that there are very few, if any, earthquakes happening on this island. As a result, fewer seismic waves are being generated and observed by the geologists in their studies of this island. This could suggest that the tectonic or geological conditions on the Small island are more stable than those on the Large island, leading to its low seismic activity. In conclusion, the Large island displayed more seismic waves due to its increased seismic activity, providing geologists with valuable information about the Earth's interior and the geological factors contributing to the island's seismic behavior."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Let's solve this math problem step by step! 1. We have the equation: -37*d + 320 = 61*d + 26 2. First, let's move all the 'd' pieces (terms with 'd') to one side of the equation. To do that, we'll add 37*d to both sides. (-37*d + 37*d) + 320 = 61*d + 26 + 37*d Since -37*d and +37*d are opposites, they cancel out: 0 + 320 = (61*d + 37*d) + 26 So now, our equation looks like this: 320 = 98*d + 26 3. Next, let's separate 'd' by moving the number without a 'd' (26) to the other side. We'll do this by subtracting 26 from both sides: 320 - 26 = 98*d + 26 - 26 294 = 98*d 4. Almost there! Now we just need to find the value of 'd'. To do this, we'll divide both sides by 98: (294 ÷ 98) = (98*d ÷ 98) 3 = d And there you have it!

During the fight, Diego's mute servant Paco (Donovan Scott) reads a letter (via gestures) from Diego's father requesting that Diego return to California [then a part of Mexico]. Diego and Paco escape by jumping from a high wall directly into a waiting carriage. Diego and Paco arrive in Los Angeles, where they are met by Diego's childhood friend Esteban (Ron Leibman), who has become capitÃ¡n of the local guard. We also learn that Esteban has married Florinda (Brenda Vaccaro), for whom the men competed when they were boys. Esteban delivers the sad news that Diego's father was killed in a riding accident, when his horse was frightened by a turtle. Esteban is acting alcalde in the senior de la Vega's stead until a new one can be chosen by the dons (landowners) of the area. At the meeting of the dons, each introduces himself and where he resides. Each Don's surname is that of a well-known city in California, but none of the surnames and place-names match, with amusing results: Don Diego from San Fernando Don Francisco from San Jose Don Fernando from San Diego Don Jose from San Bernardino Don Luis Obispo from Bakersfield, who wears an ascot Esteban is elected alcalde, via an obviously fixed election, and gives his inaugural speech to the assembled peasants in the village plaza. He is interrupted mid-speech by Charlotte Taylor-Wilson (Lauren Hutton), a wealthy political activist from Boston. She and Diego meet, and despite their political differences, there is an immediate attraction. Relaxing at the de la Vega villa, Diego receives an invitation to a masked ball to celebrate... My question: Who does Florinda turn against? A:","completion":"Florinda ultimately turns against her husband, Esteban. Throughout the movie, Florinda becomes disillusioned with Esteban's corrupt and oppressive rule as alcalde, and his iron-fisted control over the people of Los Angeles. Diego, the charming and debonair Don Juan, eventually becomes the masked hero, Zorro - fighting against injustice and tyranny, standing up for the oppressed peasants and taking action for the welfare of the citizens. As the story unfolds, Florinda begins to recognize the stark contrast between the character and motives of her husband and those of Zorro (unaware that Diego and Zorro are the same person). She finds herself questioning her allegiance to her husband and starts sympathizing with Zorro's cause. Zorro's acts of heroism, along with his respect and care for the common people, resonates with her, and she begins to find herself drawn to his ideals and fight for justice. As Florinda's loyalty to her husband diminishes, she becomes an advocate for the people who Esteban is oppressing. In the movie's climax, when Zorro's true identity is revealed, Florinda makes her final decision to stand against Esteban's tyranny by supporting Diego and his alter ego, Zorro. In doing so, she embodies the spirit of resilience and desire for justice that Zorro represents, and turns her back on her husband's corrupt and self-serving rule."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I had a stress heart attack five years ago. My step-son is a heroin addict. He will be on an opioid agonist for the rest of his life. His behavior mirrored the worst of what addicts do to a family. I was desperate to make a change, and my husband was desperate to save his son’s life. That meant having to watch my husband support my step-son as he abused me and my children. Multiple criminal behaviors, many times the police came to the house, two convictions, long-term parole. Watching him threaten to kill me, kill his father, and kill his younger brother and sister. Add to that a very stress job situation with a new boss who decided he needed a new VP, but had no basis to terminate my employment, so instead was determined to make my work life a living hell on earth.

What is the most interesting thing we learned about the Netherland's World Cup team in their match against Spain? What is the most interesting thing we learned about Spain's World Cup team in their match against the Netherlands? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","completion":"The questions are not exactly the same, as they inquire about the most interesting thing learned about each respective team - the Netherlands and Spain - during their World Cup match against each other. In response, I will provide an analysis of the most interesting discoveries for each team during that match. Netherlands: The most interesting thing we learned about the Netherlands' World Cup team during their 2014 World Cup match against Spain was their adaptability and the strength of their offensive strategies. This match displayed the Dutch team's ability to dismantle Spain's highly-skilled defense. Netherlands won this match with a remarkable 5-1 victory, showcasing their advanced techniques and tactics. The Dutch team, led by coach Louis van Gaal, implemented a 5-3-2 formation, which allowed them to take advantage of their talented forwards, Arjen Robben and Robin van Persie. Their tactic of utilizing long balls and putting immense pressure on Spain's defense led to numerous scoring opportunities - and eventually, many goals. This match proved that the Dutch team possessed a strong attack; as a matter of fact, the Netherlands had scored the highest number of goals in the 2014 World Cup group stages. Their performance against Spain not only signified their offensive prowess but also exposed the strengths of several key players, such as Daley Blind's pivotal role in creating opportunities for his teammates, Jasper Cillessen's excellent goalkeeping, and the leadership of veteran players like Dirk Kuyt. Overall, this match taught us that the Netherlands' team was a force to be reckoned with. Spain: In contrast, the most interesting thing we learned about Spain's World Cup team during their match against the Netherlands was their vulnerability and the shortcomings in their defensive strategy. They entered the World Cup as the reigning champions, having won the tournament in 2010, and were expected to showcase their prowess once again in Brazil. However, the match against the Netherlands exposed some weaknesses in their usual tactics, particularly their tiki-taka style, which relies on short passing and constant movement to maintain possession and control the game. The Dutch team disrupted this approach by employing an effective high-press strategy and quick counter-attacks. Spain's defense struggled against the pace and skill of players like Robben and Van Persie, who exploited the gaps left by their defenders. The Spanish team appeared lackluster and unprepared against the relentless Dutch attack. This match highlighted that the once-dominant Spanish side, which featured legendary players like Iker Casillas, Sergio Ramos, Xavi, and Andres Iniesta, had become susceptible to stronger, more adaptable opponents. The defeat against the Netherlands was the beginning of Spain's unsuccessful World Cup campaign in 2014, as they were ultimately eliminated in the group stages. In conclusion, while both questions are related, they focus on different aspects and lessons learned from the Netherlands and Spain during their World Cup match against each other. The Netherlands displayed their adaptability, offensive power, and key players' strengths, while Spain's vulnerability and defensive weaknesses were evident during the match."},{"prompt":"Q:Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: In 1953 American Airlines Flight 723 crashed while attempting to land at an airport located in what county?

The desk at the hotel was in better condition than the chair, because the","completion":"chair had seen years of wear and tear from countless guests who had occupied the room. The varnish on the wooden desk still held a sheen, a testament to the meticulous maintenance carried out by the diligent hotel staff. It seemed as if the desk had been treated with more respect, its purpose more dignified than that of the chair, which had clearly succumbed to the weight of years of use. The hotel room itself was modest in size, with faded wallpaper that told tales of a bygone era. A single window provided a view of the bustling city outside, allowing sunlight to trickle in just enough to illuminate the room with a soft, warm glow. The carpet, a dull shade of beige, showed signs of staining and frayed edges but was still soft to the touch, offering some semblance of comfort to weary travelers. In contrast, the chair creaked under the weight of even the lightest occupant and seemed almost out of place in the room. Its once vibrant upholstery had long since faded, leaving a mismatched assortment of threads and fabric where once a beautiful pattern had been. The chair's arms were worn smooth by countless hands gripping for support, and the cushion now barely offered any respite to those seeking a brief moment of rest. As if to further emphasize the stark difference between the two, the desk held an assortment of notepads and pens, neatly stacked and awaiting the musings of the guests. A pristine hotel guide, complete with information about the hotel's amenities and nearby attractions, lay by its side, tempting travelers to explore and experience what the area had to offer. It was evident that this desk held some importance to the overall experience of staying at this hotel. The chair, on the other hand, remained resigned to its fate of faded grandeur, only its structure weathered, but still sturdy. It stood silently beside the desk, a relic of what it once was – a royalty that had faded into mere commonality. Yet there was something endearing about the chair's resilience, its unwillingness to give up even after years of suffering. It stood as a testament to the passage of time and the shared experiences of all who had sat in it. As the years went by, the hotel saw renovations and upgrades, rooms receiving fresh coats of paint, new furniture, and modern amenities. Yet, in the corner of this particular room, the old desk and chair lived on – a solemn pair, still occupying the same space. The desk maintained its dignity, and the chair, despite its worn appearance, stood proud alongside it. The contrast between the desk and the chair was a reflection of the various journeys and stories that unfolded within the walls of that hotel room. The desk, always present, always supportive, a stable foundation for the dreams, ideas, and chronicles that would emerge on the notepads and journals that came to rest upon it. The chair, a silent witness to moments of joy and sorrow, providing comfort and solace to weary travelers in need. Together, the desk and chair told the story of the hotel – the intersecting lives of the guests, their endless stories filled with hope, triumph, and loss. Each arrival provided a fresh beginning, while each departure marked another chapter's end. But through it all, the desk and the chair persisted, standing side by side, proud symbols of the timelessness and resilience that resided within the walls of the hotel."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which person learned more about isostasy? Barry and Will are two geologists. Barry is specialized in subduction zones and new seafloor. Will is specialized in montology. Hint: As new seafloor forms and spreads apart from the mid-ocean ridge it slowly cools over time. Older seafloor is, therefore, colder than new seafloor, and older oceanic basins deeper than new oceanic basins due to isostasy. If the diameter of the earth remains relatively constant despite the production of new crust, a mechanism must exist by which crust is also destroyed. The destruction of oceanic crust occurs at subduction zones where oceanic crust is forced under either continental crust or oceanic crust. Today, the Atlantic basin is actively spreading at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Only a small portion of the oceanic crust produced in the Atlantic is subducted. However, the plates making up the Pacific Ocean are experiencing subduction along many of their boundaries which causes the volcanic activity in what has been termed the Ring of Fire of the Pacific Ocean. The Pacific is also home to one of the world's most active spreading centers (the East Pacific Rise) with spreading rates of up to 13 cm/yr. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is a \\"textbook\\" slow-spreading center, while the East Pacific Rise is used as an example of fast spreading. Spreading centers at slow and intermediate rates exhibit a rift valley while at fast rates an axial high is found within the crustal accretion zone. The differences in spreading rates affect not only the geometries of the ridges but also the geochemistry of the basalts that are produced.Since the new oceanic basins are shallower than the old oceanic basins, the total capacity of the world's ocean basins decreases during times of active sea floor spreading. During the opening of the Atlantic Ocean, sea level was so high that a Western Interior Seaway formed across North America from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Answer:","completion":"Barry learned more about isostasy, as he is specialized in subduction zones and new seafloor. The paragraph describes how older oceanic basins are deeper than new oceanic basins due to isostasy and how the destruction of oceanic crust occurs at subduction zones.

Does the answer correctly answer the question","completion":"A: The President of the United States in 1939 was Franklin D. Roosevelt. He was the 32nd President and served from 1933 to 1945. Born on January 30, 1882, in Hyde Park, New York, Roosevelt belonged to the Democratic Party. He is widely known for leading the United States through the Great Depression and World War II. Before becoming the president, he had already established an active political career. Roosevelt served as a New York State Senator, Assistant Secretary of the Navy, and Governor of New York. He was elected president for the first time in 1932 and was re-elected for three consecutive terms, making him the only US president to serve more than two terms. In response to the Great Depression, Roosevelt introduced a series of programs, public work projects, financial reforms, and regulations called the New Deal. The New Deal aimed to provide relief, recovery, and reform to the American people and the economy. Some of the most notable programs included Social Security, the Civilian Conservation Corps, and the Tennessee Valley Authority. During his presidency, Roosevelt also focused on foreign affairs. As mentioned in the initial response, he established a strong friendship with King George VI and Queen Elizabeth of the United Kingdom. This bond greatly improved relations between the two countries and laid the foundation for their alliance during World War II. In 1939, as World War II started in Europe, Roosevelt sought to provide aid to the Allies, including Britain, while maintaining the United States' neutrality. However, after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the United States was officially drawn into the war, with Roosevelt taking on the role of Commander-in-Chief. Franklin D. Roosevelt's presidency is remembered for its important domestic and international decisions that shaped the course of American and world history.

Sentence 2: Ashoka had no interest in a mass conversion. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true? Possible answers: (a). yes; (b). it is not possible to tell; (c). no;","completion":"(c). no; Based on the information given in Sentence 1, we understand that Ashoka played an active role in overseeing a mass conversion, leveraging the concept of dharma and appointing Officers of Righteousness to ensure its enforcement.

Therefore, if the first sentence is true, then the second sentence cannot also be true at the same time, because Ashoka can't simultaneously be interested in overseeing a conversion and uninterested in the conversion.

Answer the following question: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Scientists in Colombia have trained a team of rats to help remove land mines from the countryside. Land mines are small bombs hidden in the ground and designed to explode when someone steps on them. When trained, the rats can smell special metals in the mines and then signal to their human team. Then why use rats for such an important job? In the past, dogs have been used to find bombs. Rats have a good sense of smell and can respond to orders, just like dogs do. But rats are much lighter than dogs. They stand less of a chance of setting off the mines, which explode under a certain amount of weight. What's more, the best rats are cheaper to keep than dogs. It costs about the same amount of money to take care of one dog as it does 70 rats. The rats have already been used in Tanzania, an African country with many land mines. Luisa Fernanda Mendez and her team in Colombia are training the even lighter Wistar rats. These are the white rats with red eyes that scientists often use in laboratory experiments. \\" _ even train their babies to perform their jobs, which saves us a lot of time, \\" Mendez said. Colombia has the second-highest rate of deaths from land mine accidents in the world. Last year, land mines killed 695 people -- 56 of whom were children. A criminal group called the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, as well as other organizations, have placed the mines. FARC are strongly against Colombia's government. The group has placed mines all around its own bases and in many places in the countryside. In the past, the Colombian government hired peasants and poor farmers to find mines. Many of them died trying to find the well-hidden bombs. Colombian police official Erick Guzman hopes the team of rats can come to the rescue . \\"These rats will be a great help,\\" he said.

When the king is killed while suppressing a peasant rebellion, Einon is mortally wounded by the peasant girl Kara (Sandra Kovacikova). Einon's mother, Queen Aislinn (Julie Christie), has him taken before a dragon whom she implores to save the boy's life. The dragon replaces Einon's wounded heart with half of its own on the promise that Einon will rule with justice and virtue. However, Einon soon becomes more tyrannical than his father, enslaving the former rebels and forcing them to rebuild a Roman castle. Bowen believes that the dragon's heart has twisted Einon, and swears vengeance on all dragons. Twelve years later, an adult Einon (David Thewlis) has his castle rebuilt.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Background: A synthesizer (often abbreviated as synth, also spelled synthesiser) is an electronic musical instrument that generates electric signals that are converted to sound through instrument amplifiers and loudspeakers or headphones. Synthesizers may either imitate traditional musical instruments like piano, Hammond organ, flute, vocals; natural sounds like ocean waves, etc.; or generate novel electronic timbres. They are often played with a musical keyboard, but they can be controlled via a variety of other input devices, including music sequencers, instrument controllers, fingerboards, guitar synthesizers, wind controllers, and electronic drums. Synthesizers without built-in controllers are often called sound modules, and are controlled via USB, MIDI or CV/gate using a controller device, often a MIDI keyboard or other controller. Context: In the 1970s, electronic music composers such as Jean Michel Jarre, Vangelis and Isao Tomita, released successful synthesizer-led instrumental albums. Over time, this helped influence the emergence of synthpop, a subgenre of new wave, from the late 1970s to the early 1980s. The work of German krautrock bands such as Kraftwerk and Tangerine Dream, British acts such as John Foxx, Gary Numan and David Bowie, African-American acts such as George Clinton and Zapp, and Japanese electronic acts such as Yellow Magic Orchestra and Kitaro, were influential in the development of the genre. Gary Numan's 1979 hits \\"Are 'Friends' Electric?\\" and \\"Cars\\" made heavy use of synthesizers. OMD's \\"Enola Gay\\" (1980) used distinctive electronic percussion and a synthesized melody. Soft Cell used a synthesized melody on their 1981 hit \\"Tainted Love\\". Nick Rhodes, keyboardist of Duran Duran, used various synthesizers including the Roland Jupiter-4 and Jupiter-8. Chart hits include Depeche Mode's \\"Just Can't Get Enough\\" (1981), The Human League's \\"Don't You Want Me\\" and Giorgio Moroder's Take My Breath Away (1986) for Berlin. Other notable synthpop groups included New Order, Visage, Japan, Men Without Hats, Ultravox, Spandau Ballet, Culture Club, Eurythmics, Yazoo, Thompson Twins, A Flock of Seagulls, Heaven 17, Erasure, Soft Cell, Pet Shop Boys, Bronski Beat, Kajagoogoo, ABC, Naked Eyes, Devo, and the early work of Tears for Fears and Talk Talk. Giorgio Moroder, Brian Eno, Phil Collins, Howard Jones, Stevie Wonder, Peter Gabriel, Thomas Dolby, Kate Bush, Enya, Mike Oldfield, Donal Lunny, Frank Zappa and Todd Rundgren all made use of synthesizers. The synthesizer became one of the most important instruments in the music industry. Question: What styles of music is it used for?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Synthesizers have played a crucial role in shaping modern music by providing musicians with a wide range of sound possibilities and compositional options. They have been used in various styles of music, including but not limited to: 1. Electronic music: Synthesizers are the backbone of electronic music. From the early days of experimental electronic music in the 1950s and 1960s, through the development of genres like Krautrock, ambient, and Berlin School in the 1970s, to more recent subgenres such as techno, house, trance, and EDM, electronic music has relied heavily on synthesizers for generating distinctive sounds and textures. 2. Synthpop and New Wave: As mentioned in the context, synthpop emerged in the late 1970s and early 1980s as a subgenre of new wave. It is characterized by the use of synthesizers as the primary instrument, often replacing traditional rock instruments such as guitars and drums. Notable synthpop acts include Depeche Mode, The Human League, Soft Cell, and Gary Numan. New Wave also employed synthesizers, as heard in the music of bands like Talking Heads, Blondie, and Duran Duran. 3. Progressive Rock: Synthesizers are frequently employed in progressive rock, a genre known for its complex compositions and the integration of rock music with classical and experimental elements. Bands like Pink Floyd, Yes, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, and Genesis utilized synthesizers to create lush, expansive soundscapes and intricate arrangements. 4. Pop music: Synthesizers have been incorporated in many mainstream pop songs since the 1980s. Artists like Michael Jackson, Madonna, Prince, and more recently, Lady Gaga, have used synthesizers to craft catchy hooks and create unique sonic textures. 5. Film scores and soundtracks: Synthesizers have been utilized in the creation of film scores and soundtracks, contributing to the atmosphere and mood of movies. Composers such as Vangelis (Blade Runner, Chariots of Fire), John Carpenter (Halloween, Escape from New York), and Hans Zimmer (Inception, Interstellar) have made extensive use of synthesizers in their film scores. 6. Hip-hop and R&B: Synthesizers are used in hip-hop and R&B music for creating various melodic and percussive elements. Dr. Dre, Timbaland, and Kanye West are notable producers who have incorporated synthesizer sounds in their compositions. 7. Rock music: While not as prominent as in other genres, synthesizers have been used by rock bands to add depth and versatility to their sound. Bands like U2, Radiohead, and Muse have successfully integrated synthesizers into their music. 8. Experimental and avant-garde: Synthesizers have played a significant role in the development of experimental and avant-garde music, as they allow artists to explore new sonic territories and create innovative soundscapes. Composers like Brian Eno, Karlheinz Stockhausen, and Laurie Anderson have all embraced the synthesizer as a tool for pushing musical boundaries. In conclusion, the versatility and flexibility of synthesizers have made them an essential instrument across various music genres. From pop to experimental, synthesizers have helped shape the sound and identity of several musical styles and remain a vital component of modern music production."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

I’ve known a few amateur actors. But, those auditions do not include showing up for a week to work unpaid so maybe you might get hired from talking to them… And waiters don’t do auditions! I left immediately. I think they owed me 30 bucks for half a day’s work at the minimum wage. Tried to go back threatening labor board and all that, but they would not be intimidated. They said there was no record of me being there and to get off property. I wrote it off to bad experience and started working another place that I had been interviewing with. Much better job.

Philadelphia Police Detective John Hobbes visits serial killer named Edgar Reese, who he helped capture, on death row. Reese grabs Hobbes' hand and says something in an unknown language, later identified as Aramaic. After Reese is executed, Hobbes and his partner Jonesy investigate a string of murders by an apparent copycat killer. Hobbes, through hints given initially by Reese, and later by the apparent copycat killer, tracks down a woman named Gretta Milano, the daughter of a former detective. Gretta explains that her father, a detective in the same city killed himself after being accused of a series of demonic-themed murders. Hobbes goes to the Milano family's lake-house, and finds books concerning demonic possession, and sees the name Azazel written on a wall. Hobbes inquires after the name to Gretta, who gravely advises him to drop the case to protect his life and family. Gretta explains that Azazel is a fallen angel with the power to possess human beings by touch. Hobbes realizes that Azazel, while possessing Edgar Reese, touched Hobbes before the execution, but was not able to possess him. Gretta explains that the demon will try to ruin his life by another way, and warns him of the inevitability of Azazel's victory. Azazel finds Hobbes at his precinct, and through his coworkers, torments him. Hobbes reveals his knowledge of Azazel's true identity, to which the demon responds, \\"Beware my wrath\\", and disappears into the city. To provoke Hobbes, Azazel possesses his nephew Sam and attacks John's intellectually disabled brother Art in their home. He flees into other people on the street, ending up in a schoolteacher. As the teacher, Azazel draws a gun and forces Hobbes to shoot his host in front of a group of bystanders.

Background: Acromyrmex heyeri is a species of leaf-cutter ant, a New World ant of the subfamily Myrmicinae of the genus Acromyrmex. Acromyrmex heyeri workers construct the colonies nest by thatching together cut grass. At temperatures ranging from 20–30 °C, workers created more openings in the nest thatch as the internal nest temperature goes up as a method of temperature regulation for the colony. The workers will close openings in the nest thatch as the air humidity surrounding the nest decreases to reduce water loss for the colony. Paragraph: Ants are one of the most interesting creatures on earth. David wants to study ants for his biology project. He is specifically interested in ant species Acromyrmex heyeri. This semester he studied this ant in Americas. First day when he studied the ants the temperature was 10 degree Centigrade. In the second day of his study the temperature rose to 25 degree Centigrade. In the third day of his study the air humidity was high. But in the fourth day of his study air humidity dropped. David wants to continue his study of this same ant species in Asia next semester. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which day David would see more openings in the nest thatch, first day or second day?","completion":"To answer the question, we need to consider the temperature changes during David's study and the behavior of Acromyrmex heyeri ants regarding nest openings. Step 1: Identify the temperature changes on the first and second day. - On the first day, the temperature was 10 °C. - On the second day, the temperature rose to 25 °C. Step 2: Assess the ants' behavior with respect to temperature changes. - Acromyrmex heyeri workers create more openings in the nest thatch as the internal nest temperature goes up for temperature regulation. Step 3: Compare the temperature changes to the ants' behavior. - On the second day, there was a considerable temperature increase compared to the first day. Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on the comparison made in step 3. - Given the ants' behavior of creating more openings in the nest thatch as the temperature rises, David would see more openings on the second day, when the temperature was 25 °C, than on the first day when it was 10 °C."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Known today as Los Zetas, the cartel's armed wing ultimately broke apart and formed its own drug trafficking organization. Can we infer the following? Decena is the craziest drug baron of all time.","completion":"To infer whether or not Decena is the craziest drug baron of all time, we need to analyze the information provided and compare it with other known drug barons. Step 1: Analyze the information about Decena - Decena was a Mexican Army Special Forces operative who defected to the Gulf Cartel in 1997. - He founded the enforcement wing of the cartel, known as Los Zetas, at the behest of drug baron Osiel Cárdenas Guillén. - Los Zetas eventually broke apart and formed its own drug trafficking organization. Step 2: Compare Decena with other known drug barons - There are many other notorious drug barons, such as Pablo Escobar, \\"El Chapo\\" Guzmán, and Griselda Blanco. Each of these individuals had their own unique and ruthless methods in running their drug empires. - It is important to consider their respective levels of violence, ruthlessness, and impact on society when making a comparison. Step 3: Assess the validity of the claim - The information provided does not contain sufficient evidence to determine if Decena was the craziest drug baron of all time. Although he played a significant role in the formation of Los Zetas, the text only states that he did it under the orders of another drug baron, Osiel Cárdenas Guillén. - There is no mention of specific violent, ruthless, or crazy actions taken by Decena that would set him apart from other notorious drug barons. Conclusion: Based on the information provided, we cannot infer that Decena is the craziest drug baron of all time.

We need to isolate k by moving all k terms to one side of the equation and constants to the other side. To achieve this, we can subtract 44*k from both sides of the equation: 55*k - 44*k + 55 = 44*k - 44*k 3. Now simplify the equation by combining the k terms on the left side: (55 - 44)*k + 55 = 0 11*k + 55 = 0 4.

Bruno Bartoletti, Maestro Who Shaped Lyric Opera of Chicago, Dies at 86 His death was announced by Lyric and by Teatro Comunale in Florence, with which he was also associated for many years. Mr. Bartolettiâs work with Lyric spanned most of its history, an affiliation bracketed by operas of Verdi. He was 30 when he made his American debut there, conducting âIl Trovatoreâ in 1956, two years after the companyâs founding; he made his final appearance there in 2007 with âLa Traviata.â In between he led the Lyric orchestra in nearly 600 performances of more than 50 different operas. He was named co-artistic director of the company, along with Pino Donati, in 1964, and sole artistic director in 1975, a post he held until 1999. Acknowledged as a superb interpreter of the 19th- and early-20th-century music of his great countrymen, Mr. Bartoletti had a wide repertory at the Lyric â sometimes called âLa Scala Westâ â embracing other musical traditions and modern music, from Slavic works like Smetanaâs âBartered Brideâ and Mussorgskyâs âBoris Godunovâ to Alban Bergâs severe, atonal âWozzeck.â In 1978, Mr. Bartoletti conducted the world premiere of Krzysztof Pendereckiâs âParadise Lost.â In 1964, in Florence, he conducted the Italian premiere of the rarely performed early Shostakovich opera âThe Nose,â which was adapted from a subversive story by Gogol and which had been suppressed in the Soviet Union. Matthew A. Epstein, who succeeded Mr. Bartoletti as Lyricâs artistic director, said in an interview on Wednesday that it was Mr. Bartolettiâs passion for modern music that led the company to include American and 20th-century European works each season. It was Mr. Bartoletti, Mr. Epstein said, who suggested that the company forge a partnership with the American composer William Bolcom. He wrote three commissioned operas that had their premieres at Lyric from 1992 to 2004: âMcTeague,â based on the novel by Frank Norris; âA View From the Bridge,â an adaptation of the Arthur Miller play; and âA Wedding,â based on the film by Robert Altman, who directed the opera as well. âThough the gods of Verdi and Puccini and Donizetti were high in his personal pantheon, what made Bruno different from a lot of Italian conductors of his day was that this was a man who was fascinated by the music of his own time,â Mr. Epstein said. Mr. Bartoletti brought the young Italian conductors Daniele Gatti and Riccardo Chailly to Lyric for their American debuts, and he encouraged young American talent as well: Leonard Slatkin, Dennis Russell Davies and George Manahan conducted at Lyric, and a 25-year-old Peter Sellars directed âThe Mikadoâ there in 1983. âBruno pushed Lyric forward at a time when it could have been stagnating, settling into the traditional repertory,â William Mason, Lyricâs general director emeritus, said on Wednesday. âHe brought in new stage directors, more theatrical productions than we had been used to. As a conductor, baton technique was not his strong point, but there was an innate musicality and sensitivity in him, an understanding of singers and what they needed.â Among the singers with whom he worked at Lyric were the sopranos Catherine Malfitano and Renata Tebaldi; the mezzo-sopranos Grace Bumbry and Marilyn Horne, and the tenors PlÃ¡cido Domingo, Luciano Pavarotti and Richard Tucker. Mr. Bartoletti was born on June 10, 1926, in Sesto Fiorentino, near Florence. His father, Umberto, was a blacksmith who played clarinet in a local band and inspired Brunoâs interest in music. He played the piccolo as a boy, and his talent was recognized by a teacher whose husband, the sculptor Antonio Berti, recommended him to the Florence Conservatory. There he studied flute and piano and became a pianist at a center for opera training. He assisted a number of leading conductors, including Dimitri Mitropoulos, Vittorio Gui and Tullio Serafin. A longtime friend, Luigi Serra, said in an interview that during World War II, Mr. Bartoletti entertained American troops in Florence by playing the piano, and that he spoke warmly of his first contacts with Americans, the music of Cole Porter and of America in general. âPeople would say he brought so much to Chicago, but he would say it didnât matter, Chicago gave him more,â Mr. Serra said. âHe always said Chicago gave him everything.â Mr. Bartoletti made his conducting debut at Teatro Comunale with âRigolettoâ in 1953. He made his Lyric debut in 1956 as a replacement. When Mr. Serafin, who had been scheduled to conduct âIl Trovatoreâ there, became ill, the baritone Tito Gobbi recommended Mr. Bartoletti to one of the Lyricâs founders, Carol Fox. Mr. Bartoletti, who rarely strayed from the opera podium to conduct symphonic works, was not known to be especially peripatetic. But he nonetheless conducted at the Rome Opera, Covent Garden in London, La Scala in Milan, Genevaâs Grand ThÃ©Ã¢tre and Teatro ColÃ³n in Buenos Aires. He spent summers at his home in Florence. His wife, Rosanna, whom he had known since childhood, died in 2011. He is survived by two daughters, Chiara and Maria, and five grandchildren. âOne more thing to say about him,â Mr. Epstein said. âHe had a wonderful marriage, wonderful children, a beautiful home. He was a happy man.â Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"Bruno Bartoletti, a maestro who guided the Lyric Opera of Chicago for more than 50 years, passed away at the age of 86.

She nodded vigorously when I mimed the actions of a circumcision ( really , pretty easy when there 's naked baby boy in front of you ) . I did his circ today ; he cried less than most and was easily soothed by my holding him afterward ... .a cuddle I usually need as much as they do after such an experience . He is a beautiful baby : small but not scrawny , with a perfectly round head , soft alert eyes and a little round nose . Question: Why would holding a baby after you circumsised it help you ?","completion":"Holding a baby after circumcision helps both the baby and the individual performing the circumcision for various reasons. It can be an emotionally and physically comforting experience for both parties involved, and it promotes bonding, trust, and healing. 1. Emotional Support: Circumcision is a surgical procedure that can be emotionally taxing not just for the baby but also for the individual performing it. Holding the baby afterward can provide the emotional reassurance that the procedure is complete and the child is safe and well-taken care of. This emotional exchange can be soothing to both the baby and the person performing the circumcision. 2. Physical Comfort: Physical touch, especially skin-to-skin contact, is essential for newborns' development and overall well-being. Holding the baby after circumcision can help provide warmth, comfort, and security to the child. Skin-to-skin contact stimulates the release of oxytocin, known as the \\"love hormone,\\" in both the baby and the person holding them, which reinforces bonding and helps calm and soothe the baby. 3. Pain Relief: Touch and holding the baby can also help reduce the perception of pain in the baby after the circumcision. The soothing touch and cuddling can provide a sense of security that helps the baby feel less distressed. The sensations from being held can distract the baby from the pain, offering relief and making it easier for them to focus on their surroundings. 4. Trust and Bonding: Holding the baby after a circumcision helps establish trust between the baby and the person performing the procedure. This trust can be critical for the baby's future interactions with healthcare providers and can also strengthen the bond between the baby and the person who performed the circumcision. This nurturing touch helps the baby understand that he is in a safe and caring environment. 5. Reduced Stress: The act of holding the baby releases hormones in the person performing the circumcision that can help relieve stress and anxiety associated with the procedure. By providing support to the baby and feeling his comfort, the person holding the baby can also experience a sense of comfort and relief in knowing that the baby is doing well after the procedure. In conclusion, holding a baby after circumcision is not only beneficial for the baby but also for the person performing the procedure. It provides emotional support, physical comfort, pain relief, trust and bonding, and reduced stress. It is an essential component of ensuring a positive and nurturing experience for both baby and caregiver during what can be a challenging time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - Solar radiation reaches Earth's atmosphere - Some is reflected back into space - The rest of the energy is absorbed by land and oceans, heating the Earth - Heat radiates from Earth to space - Some of this heat is trapped by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere - Human activities such as burning fuel are increasing the amount of greenhouses gases - This causes more heat radiation to stay trapped in our atmosphere - The Earth's temperature rises - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose plants begin to die happens, how will it affect a SMALLER greenhouse effect. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"If plants begin to die off, it will indeed have a direct and indirect effect on the process of the greenhouse effect, potentially leading to a smaller greenhouse effect. Let's explore these effects in detail. 1. Direct Effects on Carbon Sequestration: Plants play a critical role in the global carbon cycle by absorbing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere through the process of photosynthesis. They convert this CO2 into organic compounds like glucose, which are then stored in their biomass (stems, leaves, roots, etc.). This process is known as carbon sequestration, and it helps to reduce the amount of CO2 present in the atmosphere. If plants begin to die, this carbon sequestration process would be disrupted, potentially leading to an increase in the level of atmospheric CO2. However, it's important to note that the effect on the greenhouse effect will depend on the scale of the plant die-off and the balance between the amounts of CO2 being released through natural processes like respiration and decomposition, and CO2 being absorbed by the surviving plants. 2. Indirect Effects on Climate Feedbacks: Plants also have indirect impacts on the climate system, which can influence the greenhouse effect. For example, plants can help regulate local and regional climates by releasing moisture through the process of transpiration. This process can affect local air temperatures, humidity levels, and cloud formation, which, in turn, can influence the overall energy balance and temperature of the Earth. If plants begin to die off, this could disrupt these local climate feedback processes, potentially leading to a smaller greenhouse effect in some areas. However, the effect of plant death on climate feedbacks is complex and depends on many factors, including the species of plants affected, their distribution, and their role in the local ecosystem. 3. Indirect Effects on Albedo: Another indirect effect of plant death on the greenhouse effect involves albedo, or the measure of the reflectivity of Earth's surface. Vegetation typically has a lower albedo compared to surfaces like snow, ice or bare ground. This means that areas covered in vegetation tend to absorb more solar radiation, which can help warm the Earth. If plants die off and the land becomes less vegetated, the albedo of the affected areas may increase, leading to a higher reflection of solar radiation back into space. This increased reflection could partially offset the greenhouse effect by reducing the amount of solar energy absorbed by the Earth, thereby leading to a smaller greenhouse effect. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis of plants dying off will indeed have both direct and indirect effects on the greenhouse effect that could potentially lead to a smaller greenhouse effect. However, the exact magnitude and direction of the change in the greenhouse effect will depend on several factors, including the scale of plant die off, the types of plants affected, and the balance between the different processes involved in the climate system. This implies that while plant death can cause changes in the greenhouse effect, it is crucial to consider multiple factors to understand how this relationship will change and evolve over time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When the US entered World War I in April 1917, the Navy had an immediate requirement to expand the Great Lakes Station in order to house, process, and train 20,000 naval recruits, this number would rise to 50,000 by the end of the year. Lieutenant Malachi Elliott, a graduate of the US Naval Academy, was appointed Public Works Officer at Great Lakes on 18 June 1917, at which time about 500 enlisted men had been assigned to the Public Works Department. Seeing that the department would need to expand with skilled craftsmen, architects, draftsmen, designers, and other professional and technical people, he began to screen incoming recruits with these skills. Finding many, but not enough, he expanded to recruiting civilians outside of the installation, getting many men willing to join the Navy as petty officers, with the understanding that qualified men could later apply for commissions. This allowed the Public Works Department to grow to nearly 600 men by July 1917. They were organized into the Twelfth Regiment (Public Works), which was essentially the Public Works Department because staff officers could not exercise military command. Lieutenant William C. Davis was appointed commanding officer of the regiment, he exercised military control, but the Public Works Officers exercised technical control. In October 1917, the regiment began building Camp Paul Jones at San Diego. With its completion, on 30 December 1917, the regiment became \\"fully operational\\" with 1,500 men organized into three battalions. By April 1918, the regiment consisted of 2,400 in five battalions. Men were withdrawn for assignments in the US and abroad. In spring of 1918, 100 men were given special mechanics and ordnance training before being sent to St. Nazaire, France, to assemble 14\\"/50 caliber railway gun. Later they would join the gun crews and perform combat duties along the railway lines in proximity to the Empire of Germany lines. The Twelfth Regiment reached its peak strength 5 November 1918; 55 officers and 6,211 enlisted men formed into 11 battalions. However, with the end of the war on Armistice of 11 November 1918, the regiment gradually faded away by the end of 1918.

Translate to English English:","completion":"All of this is accompanied by a culture of questioning what was not previously questioned - including the type of corporate management and the ethical quality of an organization's actions. In today's rapidly changing world, there is a growing awareness of the importance of questioning long-held beliefs and practices. This cultural shift affects various aspects of society, including the way businesses are managed and the ethical considerations behind an organization's actions. This increasing skepticism towards traditional models and the willingness to question even the most fundamental aspects of an organization are essential for progress and innovation. Starting with corporate management, organizations are reevaluating the traditional top-down hierarchical structures that have long dominated the business world. By questioning these models, companies are opening up to more inclusive, collaborative, and democratic approaches. This can lead to greater employee engagement, improved decision-making, and a more agile organizational culture. Some organizations are incorporating elements of self-management and cross-functional teams, looking at how they can empower employees to make critical decisions and foster a sense of shared ownership in the company's success. Ethical considerations have become equally important in the business world. Organizations are now expected to behave responsibly and make decisions that reflect not only their financial interests but also their social and environmental impact. This shift towards a more ethical and socially conscious business landscape has led companies to focus on corporate social responsibility (CSR) and sustainability initiatives, recognizing that decisions made today will have lasting effects on future generations. Several factors contribute to this culture of questioning previous beliefs and practices. Increased access to information through technology allows for a more transparent view of a company's operations, pressuring businesses to be more responsible and ethical in their decision-making. The rise of social media has provided a powerful platform for sharing information and holding organizations accountable for their actions. Moreover, the younger generations entering the workforce bring new perspectives and values, further driving the need for companies to reevaluate their leadership structures and ethical practices. Consumers, too, are increasingly concerned with the environmental and social impact of the products they purchase, motivating companies to adopt sustainable practices and prioritize ethical decision-making. To cultivate a culture that embraces questioning previous beliefs and practices, companies should: 1. Foster open communication and collaboration: Encourage the sharing of ideas, knowledge, and perspectives among all levels of an organization, and create an environment where employees feel comfortable challenging the status quo. 2. Redefine leadership roles: Rethink the traditional top-down management model and focus on empowering employees to take on more responsibility and accountability for decision-making. 3. Prioritize ethics and sustainability: Integrate ethical considerations into all aspects of the business, and develop long-term strategies that prioritize the well-being of people, planet, and profit. 4. Create inclusive opportunities for growth and development: Offer learning and development opportunities that enable employees to gain new skills and perspectives, and encourage them to apply this knowledge to drive innovation and change within the organization. 5. Hold leadership accountable for ethical behavior: Establishing a strong foundational code of ethics for the organization will help ensure that leadership is held accountable for their actions and the impact they have on employees, stakeholders, and the wider community. By embracing a culture that questions past practices and supports ongoing innovation, organizations can adapt and thrive amidst the challenges of the 21st century, creating a more sustainable and responsible future for all."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate to English English:","completion":"The implementation of structural reforms, which I believe is the most politically challenging part of the Lisbon Treaty, must be our primary political objective. The Lisbon Treaty, which came into force on December 1, 2009, aims to enhance the efficiency and democratic legitimacy of the European Union (EU) and to strengthen its global role. The treaty consists of numerous amendments that seek to reform the EU's institutional structure, as well as to improve its decision-making processes. However, the success of these reforms is largely dependent on their proper implementation by EU member states, which, as mentioned above, poses significant political challenges. One of the key structural reforms introduced by the Lisbon Treaty is the strengthening of the role of the European Parliament (EP) in the legislative process. This is achieved by extending the co-decision procedure, now known as the ordinary legislative procedure, to a wider range of policy areas. It enables the EP to have an equal say with the Council of the European Union on the adoption of EU legislation. As a result, the democratic legitimacy of the EU decision-making process has been enhanced, given the direct election of EP members by European citizens. Another important structural reform is the new voting system in the Council of the European Union, known as the double majority voting system. This system requires a majority of both the member states and the EU population for a decision to be approved. It was designed to ensure that decisions made within the Council are more representative of the EU's diverse population while also preventing individual member states from blocking decisions that are supported by a majority of other members. Furthermore, the Lisbon Treaty also introduced changes to the European Commission, the EU's executive body. It reduced the number of European Commissioners by making their appointment based on a rotation system among member states. This change aimed to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the Commission's work, as well as to encourage cooperation among member states. Despite these structural reforms, there are still numerous political challenges that need to be addressed. One of the most pertinent issues is the EU's democratic deficit, which refers to a perceived disconnect between EU institutions and European citizens. Although the Lisbon Treaty has strengthened the role of the EP, many citizens still feel a lack of influence on EU decision-making. This issue can be addressed by improving communication between EU institutions and citizens, as well as by encouraging greater citizen participation in the political process. Another important challenge is the difficulty of forging consensus among the 27 EU member states on key policy issues. This task is becoming increasingly complex as the EU continues to face various internal and external challenges, such as migration, economic inequality, and climate change. Addressing these challenges and implementing the structural reforms called for by the Lisbon Treaty will require strong political leadership and a commitment to dialogue and cooperation among member states. In conclusion, the implementation of structural reforms as part of the Lisbon Treaty is a crucial step towards achieving a more effective, democratic, and globally influential European Union. While there are undoubtedly political challenges to overcome, with strong leadership and genuine commitment from member states, these reforms have the potential to significantly improve the functioning of the EU and the quality of life for its citizens."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When she is on the verge of despair, Jamie reappears as a \\"ghost\\" and the couple are reunited. Nina is ecstatic. But Jamie tells her about his days while she is at work, and one dialogue suggests she should embrace the life around her; one of these is about a memorial plaque in a park about a dead child and how parents who read it feel an immediate, compelling need to hug their children. The returned Jamie also reminds her that he also irritated her, and as a ghost he manifests behaviours she'd have little patience for – turning up the central heating to stifling levels, moving furniture around and inviting back \\"ghost friends\\" to watch videos. This infuriates her, and their relationship deteriorates. She meets Mark, a psychologist, to whom she is attracted, but she is unwilling to become involved with him because of Jamie's continued presence. Nina continues to love Jamie but is conflicted by his self-centred behaviour and ultimately wonders out loud, \\"Was it always like this?\\" Over Nina's objections, Jamie decides to leave to allow her to move on. Towards the end of the film, Jamie watches Nina leave and one of his fellow ghosts asks, \\"Well?\\" and Jamie responds, \\"I think so...

Grahame was born Gloria Grahame Hallward in Los Angeles, California. She was raised a Methodist. Her father, Reginald Michael Bloxam Hallward, was an architect and author; her mother, Jeanne McDougall, who used the stage name Jean Grahame, was a British stage actress and acting teacher. The couple had an older daughter, Joy Hallward (1911-2003), an actress who married John Mitchum (the younger brother of actor Robert Mitchum). In March, 1974, Grahame was diagnosed with breast cancer. She underwent radiation treatment, changed her diet, stopped smoking and drinking alcohol, and also sought homeopathic remedies. In less than a year the cancer went into remission. The cancer returned in 1980 but Grahame refused to acknowledge her diagnosis or seek radiation treatment. Despite her failing health, Grahame continued working in stage productions in the United States and the United Kingdom. In Autumn of 1981 while performing in Lancaster, England, Grahame was taken ill. The local hospital wanted to perform surgery immediately, which she refused. Contacting her former lover, actor Peter Turner, she requested to live in Liverpool, in the home of his mother. Grahame requested that Turner not contact medical people or her family but Turner did so, as he was concerned about her health. According to Turner's book, Film Stars Don't Die in Liverpool, his local family doctor told Grahame she had a cancerous tumor in her abdomen \\"the size of a football\\". Breast cancer is not mentioned in the book. Peter Turner informed two of Grahame's children, Timothy and Paulette, who were in the United States, of her illness. They travelled to Liverpool deciding to take their mother back to the United States against the wishes of the doctor, Grahame, Peter Turner and his family. After staying six days at the home of Peter Turner's mother, on 5 October 1981 Grahame was flown back to the United States by her two children where she was immediately admitted to St. Vincent's Hospital in New York City. She died in the hospital a few hours after admittance at the age of 57. Her remains were interred in Oakwood Memorial Park Cemetery in Chatsworth, Los Angeles.

The rebellion was extended to the Oecussi enclave, but without any coordination with the rebellion elsewhere. During the second phase of his offensive, da Câmara divided his reinforced army into four columns. His own column set out from Maubisse and comprised twenty Europeans, two hundred Africans and five hundred moradores. Including the arraias of allied chieftains, it contained over 4,000 troops. It also had a modern Krupp 75 mm field gun. The second column, comprising an Indian company with a Nordenfelt mitrailleuse and several hundred moradores, marched from Soibada; the third, with two Europeans, seventy Africans and two hundred moradores armed with another Nordenfelt, from Suru; and the fourth, a flying column with one hundred moradores, from the Dutch border. By the time of the final assault, da Câmara's force, the largest foreign army ever assembled at the time in Timor, contained 8,000 irregulars, 647second-line troops, 500 first-line troops and 34 officers. Something of the weakness of the native opposition can be gleaned from the record of what weaponry the Portuguese captured: 36 rifles and 590 flintlocks with a few cartridges, plus 495 swords.

UPDATED:. 13:22 EST, 11 October 2013. A mother-of-two who advertized a 19,000 diamond ring on Craigslist has been lured hundreds of miles from her home by a man claiming he wanted to buy it before he robbed her, she has told police. Emily Graham, 32, said the man paid for her flight from Madison, Wisconsin to St Louis, Missouri for September 21, claiming he wanted to get the ring appraised and buy it for his wife. When she landed at Lambert-St. Louis International Airport, a car service picked her up to take her to a jewelry store to meet the buyer - but instead, he took her to an abandoned warehouse, she said. Scam: Emily Graham, left, said a man flew her to St Louis after responding to her Craigslist ad for a 19,000 diamond ring - before he allegedly stole it. Police have released an image of a 'person of interest', right. 'The neighborhood was really shady,' she told the St Louis Post-Dispatch. 'He pulled into the back of an abandoned warehouse and stopped the car, and someone was pounding on my window, saying, \\"Stop the car\\".' The man then demanded the ring, she said: 'It felt like an eternity, maybe 30 seconds, and I realized I've been scammed.' The driver pretended to act shocked and put his hands in the air but sat in the car while the suspect robbed her of the ring, her purse, her laptop, an iPhone, other jewelry and her shoes, she said. 'He could have killed me or raped me behind that warehouse,' she said. He hit her across the head with a pistol and forced her behind the building before leaving in the vehicle, an SUV, she said. She then ran to a nearby house for help and called police. Stolen: She said she wanted to sell the ring, pictured, to raise money as she went through a divorce. Berkeley Police Maj. Art Jackson told the Post-Dispatch that they are now checking nearby pawn shops for the items. He said the buyer had used a fake name in the correspondence and that the plane ticket had been bought with a stolen credit card. He said there was no doubt that the incident had occurred. 'We believe her,' Jackson said. 'She was in a very frantic state. Once the investigators started talking with her, they believed it did actually occur.' Victim: Graham, pictured wearing the ring, said she was taken to an abandoned building and robbed before the suspect drove off and left her there. She went to a home for help and called police. Graham, who works in website marketing, did not have the ring insured and after the robbery, she launched an online fundraising campaign to raise 30,000 to fund an after-school care program - which police said had raised some suspicions but that they weren't going to discount her story. She added that she needed the money from the ring, which she and her former husband bought and had appraised for 36,000 in 2007, because she was going through a divorce. Her husband, Jim Graham, 47, said he did not mind she had wanted to sell the ring, but that she was lucky to be alive after choosing to sell it as she had. He added that he supported her online fundraising efforts.","completion":"A woman named Emily Graham tried to sell her expensive diamond ring on a website called Craigslist.

Q:This article: Nigel Reuben Rook Williams (15 July 1944 – 21 April 1992) was an English conservator and expert on the restoration of ceramics and glass. From 1961 until his death he worked at the British Museum, where he became the Chief Conservator of Ceramics and Glass in 1983. There his work included the successful restorations of the Sutton Hoo helmet and the Portland Vase. Joining as an assistant at age 16, Williams spent his entire career, and most of his life, at the British Museum. He was one of the first people to study conservation, not yet recognised as a profession, and from an early age was given responsibility over high-profile objects. In the 1960s he assisted with the re-excavation of the Sutton Hoo ship-burial, and in his early- to mid-twenties he conserved many of the objects found therein: most notably the Sutton Hoo helmet, which occupied a year of his time. He likewise reconstructed other objects from the find, including the shield, drinking horns, and maplewood bottles. The \\"abiding passion of his life\\" was ceramics, and the 1970s and 1980s gave Williams ample opportunities in that field. After nearly 31,000 fragments of shattered Greek vases were found in 1974 amidst the wreck of HMS Colossus, Williams set to work piecing them together. The process was televised, and turned him into a television personality. A decade later, in 1988 and 1989, Williams's crowning achievement came when he took to pieces the Portland Vase, one of the most famous glass objects in the world, and put it back together. The reconstruction was again televised for a BBC programme, and as with the Sutton Hoo helmet, took nearly a year to complete. Williams died at age 47 of a heart attack while in Aqaba, Jordan, where he was working on a British Museum excavation. The Ceramics & Glass group of the Institute of Conservation awards a biennial prize in his honour, recognising his significant contributions in the field of conservation. contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose work included the successful restorations of the Sutton Hoo helmet and the Portland Vase?, what is it ?

Missed: Jimmy Savile could have been prosecuted in 2009 but police and prosecutors were too cautious, a report has found. A chance to convict Jimmy Savile for sex offences when he was alive was missed because police and prosecutors did not take victims seriously enough, an official report said today. Details of a review of the decision not to prosecute Savile in 2009 by. Alison Levitt QC, legal adviser to the director of public prosecutions, were disclosed today. Her report was released in tandem with an official police probe into the DJ's 60 years of abuse that revealed that he raped 34 women and girls and sexually assaulted up to 450, including children as young as eight. Since the paedophile DJ died in October 2011 aged 84, a staggering 214 official crimes have been recorded by 28 police forces. In her review Ms Levitt found one alleged victim was told by Sussex police officers that Savile's lawyers would make 'mincemeat' of her in a 'big London court' if she pursued her sex assault claim. In 1970, the Savile fan club member had been groped and forced to touch the DJ's genitals after he invited her into his camper van after she went to watch Top Of The Pops at BBC Television Centre. After going to the police in 2008, the woman, known as Ms A, was told by investigating officers that 'she would be publicly branded a liar and that her name would be all over the newspapers, particularly if she lost the case', the report says. Deputy Chief Constable Giles York from Sussex Police said today: 'We recognise that we could have done better and are committed to honest reflection and learning lessons for the future.' A statement from Sussex Police went on: 'We understand the conclusion the DPP has drawn, that our officers may have inadvertently dissuaded the victim from supporting any prosecution. It can be difficult in such circumstances to achieve the balance between supporting and reassuring a victim, whilst providing honest advice about the prosecution process and standard of evidence needed.' This 'dissuaded her from pursuing her allegation', she concluded. Three offences were also being investigated in 2008 by Surrey Police but they were not continued either. Ms Levitt said that there was nothing to suggest the victims had colluded in their stories, or that they were unreliable, yet police and prosecutors treated their claims 'with a degree of caution which was neither justified nor required', she said. Attack: One victim was told by police that if she pursued her claim Savile's lawyers would make 'mincemeat' of her in court. Surrey Police received an allegation in May 2007 that Savile had sexually assaulted a teenage girl at Duncroft Children's Home in the late 1970s. In the investigation that followed, two more allegations emerged - the first that in about 1973 Jimmy Savile had sexually assaulted a girl aged about 14 outside Stoke Mandeville Hospital. The second was that in the 1970s Jimmy Savile had suggested to a girl aged about 17, again at Duncroft, that she perform oral sex on him. Pledge: Keir Starmer, the Director of Public Prosecutions, said today the way sexual abuse is investigated will be changed. In March 2008, Sussex Police received a complaint that Savile had sexually assaulted a woman in her early twenties in a caravan in Sussex in about 1970. Surrey Police consulted with the CPS about all four allegations, and in October 2009 it was decided that no prosecution could be brought because the alleged victims would not support police action. Ms Levitt found that Surrey Police did not tell each alleged victim that other complaints had been made, Sussex told the complainant that corroboration was needed and the prosecutor did not question why victims would not support court action or seek to build a case. The victims told Ms Levitt that if they had known that other people were making complaints, they probably would have been prepared to give evidence in court. Meanwhile her review showed how Savile had simply said that the accusations were just 'invented' and an 'occupational hazard' for anyone famous like him. He also said he had a 'policy' to sue anyone who printed these accusations, having taken legal action against five papers previously. 'If this does not disappear then my policy will swing into action', he told Surrey officers, the report says. Surrey Police assistant chief constable Jerry Kirkby said: 'It is important the actions taken by the investigation team are viewed in context. This should take into account what information was known about Jimmy Savile in 2007 and the necessary consideration given by police to the impact of their actions on securing successful court action against him. 'At the time, there was nothing to suggest the level of offending now being reported on a national scale. In July 2007, Surrey Police used national systems to conduct intelligence checks with every other police force in England and Wales. These checks found no record of any police intelligence or prior allegations relating to Jimmy Savile.' DPP Keir Starmer said he wanted the case to be 'a watershed moment'. 'In my view, these cases do not simply reflect errors of judgment by individual officers or prosecutors on the facts before them,' he said. 'If that were the case, they would, in many respects, be easier to deal with. These were errors of judgment by experienced and committed police officers and a prosecuting lawyer acting in good faith and attempting to apply the correct principles. That makes the findings of Ms Levitt's report more profound and calls for a more robust response.' 'Hazard': Savile, who was accused of sexually assaulting a woman in his camper van, had told police that the allegations aimed at him was just because he was famous and were malicious. He drew parallels with a damning report on the investigation of a grooming gang in Rochdale. Mr Starmer said police and prosecutors have approached sex offence allegations 'with a degree of caution which is not generally justified'. He said guidance will be drawn up on prosecuting child sexual exploitation cases to underline that 'the credibility of the complainant's account has to be seen in its proper context'. An agreement has been drawn up with the Association of Chief Police Officers that:. Mr Starmer also said that information on cases where a complaint has been made but a prosecution cannot be brought will be shared more fully with police and other relevant agencies.

Tato část věty se zabývá tím, že větší část pracovních zůstatků - tj. peněžních prostředků, které podniky nebo jednotlivci drží pro své běžné náklady a provozní potřeby - je pravděpodobně umístěna ve formě bankovních vkladů. \\"Different market sources used for valuing securities\\" lze přeložit jako \\"odlišné tržní zdroje použitých pro ocenění cenných papírů\\". Cenným papírem se obvykle rozumí jakýkoliv obchodovatelný finanční nástroj, jako jsou akcie, dluhopisy nebo opciové kontrakty. Tržní zdroje, které se používají pro ocenění cenných papírů, jsou finanční instituce nebo analytické platformy, které poskytují informace o cenách a hodnotě těchto nástrojů. Použití různých zdrojů může vést k mírně odlišným výsledkům při odhadech hodnoty. \\"The impact of slightly different market sources used for valuing securities should be very limited\\" lze přeložit jako \\"dopad mírně odlišných tržních zdrojů použitých pro ocenění cenných papírů by měl být velmi omezený\\". Tato část věty naznačuje, že vliv těchto malých rozdílů v tržních zdrojích při ocenění cenných papírů by neměl být velký, jelikož většina pracovních zůstatků je držena ve formě vkladů a ne v cenných papírech. Tedy, eventuální mírné rozdíly v ocenění cenných papírů by neměly mít výrazný vliv na celkovou hodnotu těchto zůstatků."},{"prompt":"Pick from: I. get over the flu. II. rest in bed. III. get better.
